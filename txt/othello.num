4 2 Actus Primus. Scoena Prima.
4 3 
4 4 Enter Rodorigo, and Iago.
4 5 
4 6   Rodorigo. Neuer tell me, I take it much vnkindly
4 7 That thou (Iago) who hast had my purse,
4 8 As if y strings were thine, should'st know of this
4 9 
4 10    Ia. But you'l not heare me. If euer I did dream
4 11 Of such a matter, abhorre me
4 12 
4 13    Rodo. Thou told'st me,
4 14 Thou did'st hold him in thy hate
4 15 
4 16    Iago. Despise me
4 17 If I do not. Three Great-ones of the Cittie,
4 18 (In personall suite to make me his Lieutenant)
4 19 Off-capt to him: and by the faith of man
4 20 I know my price, I am worth no worsse a place.
4 21 But he (as louing his owne pride, and purposes)
4 22 Euades them, with a bumbast Circumstance,
4 23 Horribly stufft with Epithites of warre,
4 24 Non-suites my Mediators. For certes, saies he,
4 25 I haue already chose my Officer. And what was he?
4 26 For-sooth, a great Arithmatician,
4 27 One Michaell Cassio, a Florentine,
4 28 (A Fellow almost damn'd in a faire Wife)
4 29 That neuer set a Squadron in the Field,
4 30 Nor the deuision of a Battaile knowes
4 31 More then a Spinster. Vnlesse the Bookish Theoricke:
4 32 Wherein the Tongued Consuls can propose
4 33 As Masterly as he. Meere pratle (without practise)
4 34 Is all his Souldiership. But he (Sir) had th' election;
4 35 And I (of whom his eies had seene the proofe
4 36 At Rhodes, at Ciprus, and on others grounds
4 37 Christen'd, and Heathen) must be be-leed, and calm'd
4 38 By Debitor, and Creditor. This Counter-caster,
4 39 He (in good time) must his Lieutenant be,
4 40 And I (blesse the marke) his Mooreships Auntient
4 41 
4 42    Rod. By heauen, I rather would haue bin his hangman
4 43 
4 44    Iago. Why, there's no remedie.
4 45 'Tis the cursse of Seruice;
4 46 Preferment goes by Letter, and affection,
4 47 And not by old gradation, where each second
4 48 Stood Heire to'th' first. Now Sir, be iudge your selfe,
4 49 Whether I in any iust terme am Affin'd
4 50 To loue the Moore?
4 51   Rod. I would not follow him then
4 52 
4 53    Iago. O Sir content you.
4 54 I follow him, to serue my turne vpon him.
4 55 We cannot all be Masters, nor all Masters
4 56 Cannot be truely follow'd. You shall marke
4 57 Many a dutious and knee-crooking knaue;
4 58 That (doting on his owne obsequious bondage)
4 59 Weares out his time, much like his Masters Asse,
4 60 For naught but Prouender, & when he's old Casheer'd.
4 61 Whip me such honest knaues. Others there are
4 62 Who trym'd in Formes, and visages of Dutie,
4 63 Keepe yet their hearts attending on themselues,
4 64 And throwing but showes of Seruice on their Lords
4 65 Doe well thriue by them.
4 66 And when they haue lin'd their Coates
4 67 Doe themselues Homage.
4 68 These Fellowes haue some soule,
4 69 And such a one do I professe my selfe. For (Sir)
4 70 It is as sure as you are Rodorigo,
4 71 Were I the Moore, I would not be Iago:
4 72 In following him, I follow but my selfe.
4 73 Heauen is my Iudge, not I for loue and dutie,
4 74 But seeming so, for my peculiar end:
4 75 For when my outward Action doth demonstrate
4 76 The natiue act, and figure of my heart
4 77 In Complement externe, 'tis not long after
4 78 But I will weare my heart vpon my sleeue
4 79 For Dawes to pecke at; I am not what I am
4 80 
4 81    Rod. What a fall Fortune do's the Thicks-lips owe
4 82 If he can carry't thus?
4 83   Iago. Call vp her Father:
4 84 Rowse him, make after him, poyson his delight,
4 85 Proclaime him in the Streets. Incense her kinsmen,
4 86 And though he in a fertile Clymate dwell,
4 87 Plague him with Flies: though that his Ioy be Ioy,
4 88 Yet throw such chances of vexation on't,
4 89 As it may loose some colour
4 90 
4 91    Rodo. Heere is her Fathers house, Ile call aloud
4 92 
4 93    Iago. Doe, with like timerous accent, and dire yell,
4 94 As when (by Night and Negligence) the Fire
4 95 Is spied in populus Citties
4 96 
4 97    Rodo. What hoa: Brabantio, Signior Brabantio, hoa
4 98 
4 99    Iago. Awake: what hoa, Brabantio: Theeues, Theeues.
4 100 Looke to your house, your daughter, and your Bags,
4 101 Theeues, Theeues
4 102 
4 103    Bra. Aboue. What is the reason of this terrible
4 104 Summons? What is the matter there?
4 105   Rodo. Signior is all your Familie within?
4 106   Iago. Are your Doores lock'd?
4 107   Bra. Why? Wherefore ask you this?
4 108   Iago. Sir, y'are rob'd, for shame put on your Gowne,
4 109 Your heart is burst, you haue lost halfe your soule
4 110 Euen now, now, very now, an old blacke Ram
4 111 Is tupping your white Ewe. Arise, arise,
4 112 Awake the snorting Cittizens with the Bell,
4 113 Or else the deuill will make a Grand-sire of you.
4 114 Arise I say
4 115 
4 116    Bra. What, haue you lost your wits?
4 117   Rod. Most reuerend Signior, do you know my voice?
4 118   Bra. Not I: what are you?
4 119   Rod. My name is Rodorigo
4 120 
4 121    Bra. The worsser welcome:
4 122 I haue charg'd thee not to haunt about my doores:
4 123 In honest plainenesse thou hast heard me say,
4 124 My Daughter is not for thee. And now in madnesse
4 125 (Being full of Supper, and distempring draughtes)
4 126 Vpon malitious knauerie, dost thou come
4 127 To start my quiet
4 128 
4 129    Rod. Sir, Sir, Sir
4 130 
4 131    Bra. But thou must needs be sure,
4 132 My spirits and my place haue in their power
4 133 To make this bitter to thee
4 134 
4 135    Rodo. Patience good Sir
4 136 
4 137    Bra. What tell'st thou me of Robbing?
4 138 This is Venice: my house is not a Grange
4 139 
4 140    Rodo. Most graue Brabantio,
4 141 In simple and pure soule, I come to you
4 142 
4 143    Ia. Sir: you are one of those that will not serue God,
4 144 if the deuill bid you. Because we come to do you seruice,
4 145 and you thinke we are Ruffians, you'le haue your Daughter
4 146 couer'd with a Barbary horse, you'le haue your Nephewes
4 147 neigh to you, you'le haue Coursers for Cozens:
4 148 and Gennets for Germaines
4 149 
4 150    Bra. What prophane wretch art thou?
4 151   Ia. I am one Sir, that comes to tell you, your Daughter
4 152 and the Moore, are making the Beast with two backs
4 153 
4 154    Bra. Thou art a Villaine
4 155 
4 156    Iago. You are a Senator
4 157 
4 158    Bra. This thou shalt answere. I know thee Rodorigo
4 159 
4 160    Rod. Sir, I will answere any thing. But I beseech you
4 161 If't be your pleasure, and most wise consent,
4 162 (As partly I find it is) that your faire Daughter,
4 163 At this odde Euen and dull watch o'th' night
4 164 Transported with no worse nor better guard,
4 165 But with a knaue of common hire, a Gundelier,
4 166 To the grosse claspes of a Lasciuious Moore:
4 167 If this be knowne to you, and your Allowance,
4 168 We then haue done you bold, and saucie wrongs.
4 169 But if you know not this, my Manners tell me,
4 170 We haue your wrong rebuke. Do not beleeue
4 171 That from the sence of all Ciuilitie,
4 172 I thus would play and trifle with your Reuerence.
4 173 Your Daughter (if you haue not giuen her leaue)
4 174 I say againe, hath made a grosse reuolt,
4 175 Tying her Dutie, Beautie, Wit, and Fortunes
4 176 In an extrauagant, and wheeling Stranger,
4 177 Of here, and euery where: straight satisfie your selfe.
4 178 If she be in her Chamber, or your house,
4 179 Let loose on me the Iustice of the State
4 180 For thus deluding you
4 181 
4 182    Bra. Strike on the Tinder, hoa:
4 183 Giue me a Taper: call vp all my people,
4 184 This Accident is not vnlike my dreame,
4 185 Beleefe of it oppresses me alreadie.
4 186 Light, I say, light.
4 187 Enter.
4 188 
4 189   Iag. Farewell: for I must leaue you.
4 190 It seemes not meete, nor wholesome to my place
4 191 To be producted, (as if I stay, I shall,)
4 192 Against the Moore. For I do know the State,
4 193 (How euer this may gall him with some checke)
4 194 Cannot with safetie cast-him. For he's embark'd
4 195 With such loud reason to the Cyprus Warres,
4 196 (Which euen now stands in Act) that for their soules
4 197 Another of his Fadome, they haue none,
4 198 To lead their Businesse. In which regard,
4 199 Though I do hate him as I do hell paines,
4 200 Yet, for necessitie of present life,
4 201 I must show out a Flag, and signe of Loue,
4 202 (Which is indeed but signe) that you shal surely find him
4 203 Lead to the Sagitary the raised Search:
4 204 And there will I be with him. So farewell.
4 205 
4 206 Enter.
4 207 
4 208 Enter Brabantio, with Seruants and Torches.
4 209 
4 210   Bra. It is too true an euill. Gone she is,
4 211 And what's to come of my despised time,
4 212 Is naught but bitternesse. Now Rodorigo,
4 213 Where didst thou see her? (Oh vnhappie Girle)
4 214 With the Moore saist thou? (Who would be a Father?)
4 215 How didst thou know 'twas she? (Oh she deceaues me
4 216 Past thought:) what said she to you? Get moe Tapers.
4 217 Raise all my Kindred. Are they married thinke you?
4 218   Rodo. Truely I thinke they are
4 219 
4 220    Bra. Oh Heauen: how got she out?
4 221 Oh treason of the blood.
4 222 Fathers, from hence trust not your Daughters minds
4 223 By what you see them act. Is there not Charmes,
4 224 By which the propertie of Youth, and Maidhood
4 225 May be abus'd? Haue you not read Rodorigo,
4 226 Of some such thing?
4 227   Rod. Yes Sir: I haue indeed
4 228 
4 229    Bra. Call vp my Brother: oh would you had had her.
4 230 Some one way, some another. Doe you know
4 231 Where we may apprehend her, and the Moore?
4 232   Rod. I thinke I can discouer him, if you please
4 233 To get good Guard, and go along with me
4 234 
4 235    Bra. Pray you lead on. At euery house Ile call,
4 236 (I may command at most) get Weapons (hoa)
4 237 And raise some speciall Officers of might:
4 238 On good Rodorigo, I will deserue your paines.
4 239 
4 240 Exeunt.
4 241 
4 242 
4 243 Scena Secunda.
4 244 
4 245 Enter Othello, Iago, Attendants, with Torches.
4 246 
4 247   Ia. Though in the trade of Warre I haue slaine men,
4 248 Yet do I hold it very stuffe o'th' conscience
4 249 To do no contriu'd Murder: I lacke Iniquitie
4 250 Sometime to do me seruice. Nine, or ten times
4 251 I had thought t'haue yerk'd him here vnder the Ribbes
4 252 
4 253    Othello. 'Tis better as it is
4 254 
4 255    Iago. Nay but he prated,
4 256 And spoke such scuruy, and prouoking termes
4 257 Against your Honor, that with the little godlinesse I haue
4 258 I did full hard forbeare him. But I pray you Sir,
4 259 Are you fast married? Be assur'd of this,
4 260 That the Magnifico is much belou'd,
4 261 And hath in his effect a voice potentiall
4 262 As double as the Dukes: He will diuorce you.
4 263 Or put vpon you, what restraint or greeuance,
4 264 The Law (with all his might, to enforce it on)
4 265 Will giue him Cable
4 266 
4 267    Othel. Let him do his spight;
4 268 My Seruices, which I haue done the Signorie
4 269 Shall out-tongue his Complaints. 'Tis yet to know,
4 270 Which when I know, that boasting is an Honour,
4 271 I shall promulgate. I fetch my life and being,
4 272 From Men of Royall Seige. And my demerites
4 273 May speake (vnbonnetted) to as proud a Fortune
4 274 As this that I haue reach'd. For know Iago,
4 275 But that I loue the gentle Desdemona,
4 276 I would not my vnhoused free condition
4 277 Put into Circumscription, and Confine,
4 278 For the Seas worth. But looke, what Lights come yond?
4 279 
4 280 Enter Cassio, with Torches.
4 281 
4 282   Iago. Those are the raised Father, and his Friends:
4 283 You were best go in
4 284 
4 285    Othel. Not I: I must be found.
4 286 My Parts, my Title, and my perfect Soule
4 287 Shall manifest me rightly. Is it they?
4 288   Iago. By Ianus, I thinke no
4 289 
4 290    Othel. The Seruants of the Dukes?
4 291 And my Lieutenant?
4 292 The goodnesse of the Night vpon you (Friends)
4 293 What is the Newes?
4 294   Cassio. The Duke do's greet you (Generall)
4 295 And he requires your haste, Post-haste appearance,
4 296 Euen on the instant
4 297 
4 298    Othello. What is the matter, thinke you?
4 299   Cassio. Something from Cyprus, as I may diuine:
4 300 It is a businesse of some heate. The Gallies
4 301 Haue sent a dozen sequent Messengers
4 302 This very night, at one anothers heeles:
4 303 And many of the Consuls, rais'd and met,
4 304 Are at the Dukes already. You haue bin hotly call'd for,
4 305 When being not at your Lodging to be found,
4 306 The Senate hath sent about three seuerall Quests,
4 307 To search you out
4 308 
4 309    Othel. 'Tis well I am found by you:
4 310 I will but spend a word here in the house,
4 311 And goe with you
4 312 
4 313    Cassio. Aunciant, what makes he heere?
4 314   Iago. Faith, he to night hath boarded a Land Carract,
4 315 If it proue lawfull prize, he's made for euer
4 316 
4 317    Cassio. I do not vnderstand
4 318 
4 319    Iago. He's married
4 320 
4 321    Cassio. To who?
4 322   Iago. Marry to- Come Captaine, will you go?
4 323   Othel. Haue with you
4 324 
4 325    Cassio. Here comes another Troope to seeke for you.
4 326 
4 327 Enter Brabantio, Rodorigo, with Officers, and Torches.
4 328 
4 329   Iago. It is Brabantio: Generall be aduis'd,
4 330 He comes to bad intent
4 331 
4 332    Othello. Holla, stand there
4 333 
4 334    Rodo. Signior, it is the Moore
4 335 
4 336    Bra. Downe with him, Theefe
4 337 
4 338    Iago. You, Rodorigo? Come Sir, I am for you
4 339 
4 340    Othe. Keepe vp your bright Swords, for the dew will
4 341 rust them. Good Signior, you shall more command with
4 342 yeares, then with your Weapons
4 343 
4 344    Bra. Oh thou foule Theefe,
4 345 Where hast thou stow'd my Daughter?
4 346 Damn'd as thou art, thou hast enchaunted her
4 347 For Ile referre me to all things of sense,
4 348 (If she in Chaines of Magick were not bound)
4 349 Whether a Maid, so tender, Faire, and Happie,
4 350 So opposite to Marriage, that she shun'd
4 351 The wealthy curled Deareling of our Nation,
4 352 Would euer haue (t' encurre a generall mocke)
4 353 Run from her Guardage to the sootie bosome,
4 354 Of such a thing as thou: to feare, not to delight?
4 355 Iudge me the world, if 'tis not grosse in sense,
4 356 That thou hast practis'd on her with foule Charmes,
4 357 Abus'd her delicate Youth, with Drugs or Minerals,
4 358 That weakens Motion. Ile haue't disputed on,
4 359 'Tis probable, and palpable to thinking;
4 360 I therefore apprehend and do attach thee,
4 361 For an abuser of the World, a practiser
4 362 Of Arts inhibited, and out of warrant;
4 363 Lay hold vpon him, if he do resist
4 364 Subdue him, at his perill
4 365 
4 366    Othe. Hold your hands
4 367 Both you of my inclining, and the rest.
4 368 Were it my Cue to fight, I should haue knowne it
4 369 Without a Prompter. Whether will you that I goe
4 370 To answere this your charge?
4 371   Bra. To Prison, till fit time
4 372 Of Law, and course of direct Session
4 373 Call thee to answer
4 374 
4 375    Othe. What if I do obey?
4 376 How may the Duke be therewith satisfi'd,
4 377 Whose Messengers are heere about my side,
4 378 Vpon some present businesse of the State,
4 379 To bring me to him
4 380 
4 381    Officer. 'Tis true most worthy Signior,
4 382 The Dukes in Counsell, and your Noble selfe,
4 383 I am sure is sent for
4 384 
4 385    Bra. How? The Duke in Counsell?
4 386 In this time of the night? Bring him away;
4 387 Mine's not an idle Cause. The Duke himselfe,
4 388 Or any of my Brothers of the State,
4 389 Cannot but feele this wrong, as 'twere their owne:
4 390 For if such Actions may haue passage free,
4 391 Bond-slaues, and Pagans shall our Statesmen be.
4 392 
4 393 Exeunt.
4 394 
4 395 Scaena Tertia.
4 396 
4 397 Enter Duke, Senators, and Officers.
4 398 
4 399   Duke. There's no composition in this Newes,
4 400 That giues them Credite
4 401 
4 402    1.Sen. Indeed, they are disproportioned;
4 403 My Letters say, a Hundred and seuen Gallies
4 404 
4 405    Duke. And mine a Hundred fortie
4 406 
4 407    2.Sena. And mine two Hundred:
4 408 But though they iumpe not on a iust accompt,
4 409 (As in these Cases where the ayme reports,
4 410 'Tis oft with difference) yet do they all confirme
4 411 A Turkish Fleete, and bearing vp to Cyprus
4 412 
4 413    Duke. Nay, it is possible enough to iudgement:
4 414 I do not so secure me in the Error,
4 415 But the maine Article I do approue
4 416 In fearefull sense
4 417 
4 418    Saylor within. What hoa, what hoa, what hoa.
4 419 
4 420 Enter Saylor.
4 421 
4 422   Officer. A Messenger from the Gallies
4 423 
4 424    Duke. Now? What's the businesse?
4 425   Sailor. The Turkish Preparation makes for Rhodes,
4 426 So was I bid report here to the State,
4 427 By Signior Angelo
4 428 
4 429    Duke. How say you by this change?
4 430   1.Sen. This cannot be
4 431 By no assay of reason. 'Tis a Pageant
4 432 To keepe vs in false gaze, when we consider
4 433 Th' importancie of Cyprus to the Turke;
4 434 And let our selues againe but vnderstand,
4 435 That as it more concernes the Turke then Rhodes,
4 436 So may he with more facile question beare it,
4 437 For that it stands not in such Warrelike brace,
4 438 But altogether lackes th' abilities
4 439 That Rhodes is dress'd in. If we make thought of this,
4 440 We must not thinke the Turke is so vnskillfull,
4 441 To leaue that latest, which concernes him first,
4 442 Neglecting an attempt of ease, and gaine
4 443 To wake, and wage a danger profitlesse
4 444 
4 445    Duke. Nay, in all confidence he's not for Rhodes
4 446 
4 447    Officer. Here is more Newes.
4 448 
4 449 Enter a Messenger.
4 450 
4 451   Messen. The Ottamites, Reueren'd, and Gracious,
4 452 Steering with due course toward the Ile of Rhodes,
4 453 Haue there inioynted them with an after Fleete
4 454 
4 455    1.Sen. I, so I thought: how many, as you guesse?
4 456   Mess. Of thirtie Saile: and now they do re-stem
4 457 Their backward course, bearing with frank appearance
4 458 Their purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano,
4 459 Your trustie and most Valiant Seruitour,
4 460 With his free dutie, recommends you thus,
4 461 And prayes you to beleeue him
4 462 
4 463    Duke. 'Tis certaine then for Cyprus:
4 464 Marcus Luccicos is not he in Towne?
4 465   1.Sen. He's now in Florence
4 466 
4 467    Duke. Write from vs,
4 468 To him, Post, Post-haste, dispatch
4 469 
4 470    1.Sen. Here comes Brabantio, and the Valiant Moore.
4 471 
4 472 Enter Brabantio, Othello, Cassio, Iago, Rodorigo, and Officers.
4 473 
4 474   Duke. Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you,
4 475 Against the generall Enemy Ottoman.
4 476 I did not see you: welcome gentle Signior,
4 477 We lack't your Counsaile, and your helpe to night
4 478 
4 479    Bra. So did I yours: Good your Grace pardon me.
4 480 Neither my place, nor ought I heard of businesse
4 481 Hath rais'd me from my bed; nor doth the generall care
4 482 Take hold on me. For my perticular griefe
4 483 Is of so flood-gate, and ore-bearing Nature,
4 484 That it engluts, and swallowes other sorrowes,
4 485 And it is still it selfe
4 486 
4 487    Duke. Why? What's the matter?
4 488   Bra. My Daughter: oh my Daughter!
4 489   Sen. Dead?
4 490   Bra. I, to me.
4 491 She is abus'd, stolne from me, and corrupted
4 492 By Spels, and Medicines, bought of Mountebanks;
4 493 For Nature, so prepostrously to erre,
4 494 (Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense,)
4 495 Sans witch-craft could not
4 496 
4 497    Duke. Who ere he be, that in this foule proceeding
4 498 Hath thus beguil'd your Daughter of her selfe,
4 499 And you of her; the bloodie Booke of Law,
4 500 You shall your selfe read, in the bitter letter,
4 501 After your owne sense: yea, though our proper Son
4 502 Stood in your Action
4 503 
4 504    Bra. Humbly I thanke your Grace,
4 505 Here is the man; this Moore, whom now it seemes
4 506 Your speciall Mandate, for the State affaires
4 507 Hath hither brought
4 508 
4 509    All. We are verie sorry for't
4 510 
4 511    Duke. What in your owne part, can you say to this?
4 512   Bra. Nothing, but this is so
4 513 
4 514    Othe. Most Potent, Graue, and Reueren'd Signiors,
4 515 My very Noble, and approu'd good Masters;
4 516 That I haue tane away this old mans Daughter,
4 517 It is most true: true I haue married her;
4 518 The verie head, and front of my offending,
4 519 Hath this extent; no more. Rude am I, in my speech,
4 520 And little bless'd with the soft phrase of Peace;
4 521 For since these Armes of mine, had seuen yeares pith,
4 522 Till now, some nine Moones wasted, they haue vs'd
4 523 Their deerest action, in the Tented Field:
4 524 And little of this great world can I speake,
4 525 More then pertaines to Feats of Broiles, and Battaile,
4 526 And therefore little shall I grace my cause,
4 527 In speaking for my selfe. Yet, (by your gratious patience)
4 528 I will a round vn-varnish'd Tale deliuer,
4 529 Of my whole course of Loue.
4 530 What Drugges, what Charmes,
4 531 What Coniuration, and what mighty Magicke,
4 532 (For such proceeding I am charg'd withall)
4 533 I won his Daughter
4 534 
4 535    Bra. A Maiden, neuer bold:
4 536 Of Spirit so still, and quiet, that her Motion
4 537 Blush'd at her selfe, and she, in spight of Nature,
4 538 Of Yeares, of Country, Credite, euery thing
4 539 To fall in Loue, with what she fear'd to looke on;
4 540 It is a iudgement main'd, and most imperfect.
4 541 That will confesse Perfection so could erre
4 542 Against all rules of Nature, and must be driuen
4 543 To find out practises of cunning hell
4 544 Why this should be. I therefore vouch againe,
4 545 That with some Mixtures, powrefull o're the blood,
4 546 Or with some Dram, (coniur'd to this effect)
4 547 He wrought vpon her.
4 548 To vouch this, is no proofe,
4 549 Without more wider, and more ouer Test
4 550 Then these thin habits, and poore likely-hoods
4 551 Of moderne seeming, do prefer against him
4 552 
4 553    Sen. But Othello, speake,
4 554 Did you, by indirect, and forced courses
4 555 Subdue, and poyson this yong Maides affections?
4 556 Or came it by request, and such faire question
4 557 As soule, to soule affordeth?
4 558   Othel. I do beseech you,
4 559 Send for the Lady to the Sagitary,
4 560 And let her speake of me before her Father;
4 561 If you do finde me foule, in her report,
4 562 The Trust, the Office, I do hold of you,
4 563 Not onely take away, but let your Sentence
4 564 Euen fall vpon my life
4 565 
4 566    Duke. Fetch Desdemona hither
4 567 
4 568    Othe. Aunciant, conduct them:
4 569 You best know the place.
4 570 And tell she come, as truely as to heauen,
4 571 I do confesse the vices of my blood,
4 572 So iustly to your Graue eares, Ile present
4 573 How I did thriue in this faire Ladies loue,
4 574 And she in mine
4 575 
4 576    Duke. Say it Othello
4 577 
4 578    Othe. Her Father lou'd me, oft inuited me:
4 579 Still question'd me the Storie of my life,
4 580 From yeare to yeare: the Battaile, Sieges, Fortune,
4 581 That I haue past.
4 582 I ran it through, euen from my boyish daies,
4 583 Toth' very moment that he bad me tell it.
4 584 Wherein I spoke of most disastrous chances:
4 585 Of mouing Accidents by Flood and Field,
4 586 Of haire-breadth scapes i'th' imminent deadly breach;
4 587 Of being taken by the Insolent Foe,
4 588 And sold to slauery. Of my redemption thence,
4 589 And portance in my Trauellours historie.
4 590 Wherein of Antars vast, and Desarts idle,
4 591 Rough Quarries, Rocks, Hills, whose head touch heauen,
4 592 It was my hint to speake. Such was my Processe,
4 593 And of the Canibals that each others eate,
4 594 The Antropophague, and men whose heads
4 595 Grew beneath their shoulders. These things to heare,
4 596 Would Desdemona seriously incline:
4 597 But still the house Affaires would draw her hence:
4 598 Which euer as she could with haste dispatch,
4 599 She'l'd come againe, and with a greedie eare
4 600 Deuoure vp my discourse. Which I obseruing,
4 601 Tooke once a pliant houre, and found good meanes
4 602 To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart,
4 603 That I would all my Pilgrimage dilate,
4 604 Whereof by parcels she had something heard,
4 605 But not instinctiuely: I did consent,
4 606 And often did beguile her of her teares,
4 607 When I did speake of some distressefull stroke
4 608 That my youth suffer'd: My Storie being done,
4 609 She gaue me for my paines a world of kisses:
4 610 She swore in faith 'twas strange: 'twas passing strange,
4 611 'Twas pittifull: 'twas wondrous pittifull.
4 612 She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd
4 613 That Heauen had made her such a man. She thank'd me,
4 614 And bad me, if I had a Friend that lou'd her,
4 615 I should but teach him how to tell my Story,
4 616 And that would wooe her. Vpon this hint I spake,
4 617 She lou'd me for the dangers I had past,
4 618 And I lou'd her, that she did pitty them.
4 619 This onely is the witch-craft I haue vs'd.
4 620 Here comes the Ladie: Let her witnesse it.
4 621 
4 622 Enter Desdemona, Iago, Attendants.
4 623 
4 624   Duke. I thinke this tale would win my Daughter too,
4 625 Good Brabantio, take vp this mangled matter at the best:
4 626 Men do their broken Weapons rather vse,
4 627 Then their bare hands
4 628 
4 629    Bra. I pray you heare her speake?
4 630 If she confesse that she was halfe the wooer,
4 631 Destruction on my head, if my bad blame
4 632 Light on the man. Come hither gentle Mistris,
4 633 Do you perceiue in all this Noble Companie,
4 634 Where most you owe obedience?
4 635   Des. My Noble Father,
4 636 I do perceiue heere a diuided dutie.
4 637 To you I am bound for life, and education:
4 638 My life and education both do learne me,
4 639 How to respect you. You are the Lord of duty,
4 640 I am hitherto your Daughter. But heere's my Husband;
4 641 And so much dutie, as my Mother shew'd
4 642 To you, preferring you before her Father:
4 643 So much I challenge, that I may professe
4 644 Due to the Moore my Lord
4 645 
4 646    Bra. God be with you: I haue done.
4 647 Please it your Grace, on to the State Affaires;
4 648 I had rather to adopt a Child, then get it.
4 649 Come hither Moore;
4 650 I here do giue thee that with all my heart,
4 651 Which but thou hast already, with all my heart
4 652 I would keepe from thee. For your sake (Iewell)
4 653 I am glad at soule, I haue no other Child,
4 654 For thy escape would teach me Tirranie
4 655 To hang clogges on them. I haue done my Lord
4 656 
4 657    Duke. Let me speake like your selfe:
4 658 And lay a Sentence,
4 659 Which as a grise, or step may helpe these Louers.
4 660 When remedies are past, the griefes are ended
4 661 By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.
4 662 To mourne a Mischeefe that is past and gon,
4 663 Is the next way to draw new mischiefe on.
4 664 What cannot be preseru'd, when Fortune takes:
4 665 Patience, her Iniury a mock'ry makes.
4 666 The rob'd that smiles, steales something from the Thiefe,
4 667 He robs himselfe, that spends a bootelesse griefe
4 668 
4 669    Bra. So let the Turke of Cyprus vs beguile,
4 670 We loose it not so long as we can smile:
4 671 He beares the Sentence well, that nothing beares,
4 672 But the free comfort which from thence he heares.
4 673 But he beares both the Sentence, and the sorrow,
4 674 That to pay griefe, must of poore Patience borrow.
4 675 These Sentences, to Sugar, or to Gall,
4 676 Being strong on both sides, are Equiuocall.
4 677 But words are words, I neuer yet did heare:
4 678 That the bruized heart was pierc'd through the eares.
4 679 I humbly beseech you proceed to th' Affaires of State
4 680 
4 681    Duke. The Turke with a most mighty Preparation
4 682 makes for Cyprus: Othello, the Fortitude of the place is
4 683 best knowne to you. And though we haue there a Substitute
4 684 of most allowed sufficiencie; yet opinion, a more
4 685 soueraigne Mistris of Effects, throwes a more safer
4 686 voice on you: you must therefore be content to slubber
4 687 the glosse of your new Fortunes, with this more stubborne,
4 688 and boystrous expedition
4 689 
4 690    Othe. The Tirant Custome, most Graue Senators,
4 691 Hath made the flinty and Steele Coach of Warre
4 692 My thrice-driuen bed of Downe. I do agnize
4 693 A Naturall and prompt Alacratie,
4 694 I finde in hardnesse: and do vndertake
4 695 This present Warres against the Ottamites.
4 696 Most humbly therefore bending to your State,
4 697 I craue fit disposition for my Wife,
4 698 Due reference of Place, and Exhibition,
4 699 With such Accomodation and besort
4 700 As leuels with her breeding
4 701 
4 702    Duke. Why at her Fathers?
4 703   Bra. I will not haue it so
4 704 
4 705    Othe. Nor I
4 706 
4 707    Des. Nor would I there recide,
4 708 To put my Father in impatient thoughts
4 709 By being in his eye. Most Gracious Duke,
4 710 To my vnfolding, lend your prosperous eare,
4 711 And let me finde a Charter in your voice
4 712 T' assist my simplenesse
4 713 
4 714    Duke. What would you Desdemona?
4 715   Des. That I loue the Moore, to liue with him,
4 716 My downe-right violence, and storme of Fortunes,
4 717 May trumpet to the world. My heart's subdu'd
4 718 Euen to the very quality of my Lord;
4 719 I saw Othello's visage in his mind,
4 720 And to his Honours and his valiant parts,
4 721 Did I my soule and Fortunes consecrate.
4 722 So that (deere Lords) if I be left behind
4 723 A Moth of Peace, and he go to the Warre,
4 724 The Rites for why I loue him, are bereft me:
4 725 And I a heauie interim shall support
4 726 By his deere absence. Let me go with him
4 727 
4 728    Othe. Let her haue your voice.
4 729 Vouch with me Heauen, I therefore beg it not
4 730 To please the pallate of my Appetite:
4 731 Nor to comply with heat the yong affects
4 732 In my defunct, and proper satisfaction.
4 733 But to be free, and bounteous to her minde:
4 734 And Heauen defend your good soules, that you thinke
4 735 I will your serious and great businesse scant
4 736 When she is with me. No, when light wing'd Toyes
4 737 Of feather'd Cupid, seele with wanton dulnesse
4 738 My speculatiue, and offic'd Instrument:
4 739 That my Disports corrupt, and taint my businesse:
4 740 Let House-wiues make a Skillet of my Helme,
4 741 And all indigne, and base aduersities,
4 742 Make head against my Estimation
4 743 
4 744    Duke. Be it as you shall priuately determine,
4 745 Either for her stay, or going: th' Affaire cries hast:
4 746 And speed must answer it
4 747 
4 748    Sen. You must away to night
4 749 
4 750    Othe. With all my heart
4 751 
4 752    Duke. At nine i'th' morning, here wee'l meete againe.
4 753 Othello, leaue some Officer behind
4 754 And he shall our Commission bring to you:
4 755 And such things else of qualitie and respect
4 756 As doth import you
4 757 
4 758    Othe. So please your Grace, my Ancient,
4 759 A man he is of honesty and trust:
4 760 To his conueyance I assigne my wife,
4 761 With what else needfull, your good Grace shall think
4 762 To be sent after me
4 763 
4 764    Duke. Let it be so:
4 765 Good night to euery one. And Noble Signior,
4 766 If Vertue no delighted Beautie lacke,
4 767 Your Son-in-law is farre more Faire then Blacke
4 768 
4 769    Sen. Adieu braue Moore, vse Desdemona well
4 770 
4 771    Bra. Looke to her (Moore) if thou hast eies to see:
4 772 She ha's deceiu'd her Father, and may thee.
4 773 Enter.
4 774 
4 775   Othe. My life vpon her faith. Honest Iago,
4 776 My Desdemona must I leaue to thee:
4 777 I prythee let thy wife attend on her,
4 778 And bring them after in the best aduantage.
4 779 Come Desdemona, I haue but an houre
4 780 Of Loue, of wordly matter, and direction
4 781 To spend with thee. We must obey the time.
4 782 Enter.
4 783 
4 784   Rod. Iago
4 785 
4 786    Iago. What saist thou Noble heart?
4 787   Rod. What will I do, think'st thou?
4 788   Iago. Why go to bed and sleepe
4 789 
4 790    Rod. I will incontinently drowne my selfe
4 791 
4 792    Iago. If thou do'st, I shall neuer loue thee after. Why
4 793 thou silly Gentleman?
4 794   Rod. It is sillynesse to liue, when to liue is torment:
4 795 and then haue we a prescription to dye, when death is
4 796 our Physition
4 797 
4 798    Iago. Oh villanous: I haue look'd vpon the world
4 799 for foure times seuen yeares, and since I could distinguish
4 800 betwixt a Benefit, and an Iniurie: I neuer found man that
4 801 knew how to loue himselfe. Ere I would say, I would
4 802 drowne my selfe for the loue of a Gynney Hen, I would
4 803 change my Humanity with a Baboone
4 804 
4 805    Rod. What should I do? I confesse it is my shame
4 806 to be so fond, but it is not in my vertue to amend it
4 807 
4 808    Iago. Vertue? A figge, 'tis in our selues that we are
4 809 thus, or thus. Our Bodies are our Gardens, to the which,
4 810 our Wills are Gardiners. So that if we will plant Nettels,
4 811 or sowe Lettice: Set Hisope, and weede vp Time:
4 812 Supplie it with one gender of Hearbes, or distract it with
4 813 many: either to haue it sterrill with idlenesse, or manured
4 814 with Industry, why the power, and Corrigeable authoritie
4 815 of this lies in our Wills. If the braine of our liues
4 816 had not one Scale of Reason, to poize another of Sensualitie,
4 817 the blood, and basenesse of our Natures would
4 818 conduct vs to most prepostrous Conclusions. But we
4 819 haue Reason to coole our raging Motions, our carnall
4 820 Stings, or vnbitted Lusts: whereof I take this, that you
4 821 call Loue, to be a Sect, or Seyen
4 822 
4 823    Rod. It cannot be
4 824 
4 825    Iago. It is meerly a Lust of the blood, and a permission
4 826 of the will. Come, be a man: drowne thy selfe? Drown
4 827 Cats, and blind Puppies. I haue profest me thy Friend,
4 828 and I confesse me knit to thy deseruing, with Cables of
4 829 perdurable toughnesse. I could neuer better steed thee
4 830 then now. Put Money in thy purse: follow thou the
4 831 Warres, defeate thy fauour, with an vsurp'd Beard. I say
4 832 put Money in thy purse. It cannot be long that Desdemona
4 833 should continue her loue to the Moore. Put Money in
4 834 thy purse: nor he his to her. It was a violent Commencement
4 835 in her, and thou shalt see an answerable Sequestration,
4 836 put but Money in thy purse. These Moores
4 837 are changeable in their wils: fill thy purse with Money.
4 838 The Food that to him now is as lushious as Locusts,
4 839 shalbe to him shortly, as bitter as Coloquintida. She
4 840 must change for youth: when she is sated with his body
4 841 she will find the errors of her choice. Therefore, put Money
4 842 in thy purse. If thou wilt needs damne thy selfe, do
4 843 it a more delicate way then drowning. Make all the Money
4 844 thou canst: If Sanctimonie, and a fraile vow, betwixt
4 845 an erring Barbarian, and super-subtle Venetian be
4 846 not too hard for my wits, and all the Tribe of hell, thou
4 847 shalt enioy her: therefore make Money: a pox of drowning
4 848 thy selfe, it is cleane out of the way. Seeke thou rather
4 849 to be hang'd in Compassing thy ioy, then to be
4 850 drown'd, and go without her
4 851 
4 852    Rodo. Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on
4 853 the issue?
4 854   Iago. Thou art sure of me: Go make Money: I haue
4 855 told thee often, and I re-tell thee againe, and againe, I
4 856 hate the Moore. My cause is hearted; thine hath no lesse
4 857 reason. Let vs be coniunctiue in our reuenge, against
4 858 him. If thou canst Cuckold him, thou dost thy selfe a
4 859 pleasure, me a sport. There are many Euents in the
4 860 Wombe of Time, which wilbe deliuered. Trauerse, go,
4 861 prouide thy Money. We will haue more of this to morrow.
4 862 Adieu
4 863 
4 864    Rod. Where shall we meete i'th' morning?
4 865   Iago. At my Lodging
4 866 
4 867    Rod. Ile be with thee betimes
4 868 
4 869    Iago. Go too, farewell. Do you heare Rodorigo?
4 870   Rod. Ile sell all my Land.
4 871 Enter.
4 872 
4 873   Iago. Thus do I euer make my Foole, my purse:
4 874 For I mine owne gain'd knowledge should prophane
4 875 If I would time expend with such Snipe,
4 876 But for my Sport, and Profit: I hate the Moore,
4 877 And it is thought abroad, that 'twixt my sheets
4 878 She ha's done my Office. I know not if't be true,
4 879 But I, for meere suspition in that kinde,
4 880 Will do, as if for Surety. He holds me well,
4 881 The better shall my purpose worke on him:
4 882 Cassio's a proper man: Let me see now,
4 883 To get his Place, and to plume vp my will
4 884 In double Knauery. How? How? Let's see.
4 885 After some time, to abuse Othello's eares,
4 886 That he is too familiar with his wife:
4 887 He hath a person, and a smooth dispose
4 888 To be suspected: fram'd to make women false.
4 889 The Moore is of a free, and open Nature,
4 890 That thinkes men honest, that but seeme to be so,
4 891 And will as tenderly be lead by'th' Nose
4 892 As Asses are:
4 893 I hau't: it is engendred: Hell, and Night,
4 894 Must bring this monstrous Birth, to the worlds light.
4 895 
4 896 Actus Secundus. Scena Prima.
4 897 
4 898 Enter Montano, and two Gentlemen.
4 899 
4 900   Mon. What from the Cape, can you discerne at Sea?
4 901   1.Gent. Nothing at all, it is a high wrought Flood:
4 902 I cannot 'twixt the Heauen, and the Maine,
4 903 Descry a Saile
4 904 
4 905    Mon. Me thinks, the wind hath spoke aloud at Land,
4 906 A fuller blast ne're shooke our Battlements:
4 907 If it hath ruffiand so vpon the Sea,
4 908 What ribbes of Oake, when Mountaines melt on them,
4 909 Can hold the Morties. What shall we heare of this?
4 910   2 A Segregation of the Turkish Fleet:
4 911 For do but stand vpon the Foaming Shore,
4 912 The chidden Billow seemes to pelt the Clowds,
4 913 The winde-shak'd-Surge, with high & monstrous Maine
4 914 Seemes to cast water on the burning Beare,
4 915 And quench the Guards of th' euer-fixed Pole:
4 916 I neuer did like mollestation view
4 917 On the enchafed Flood
4 918 
4 919    Men. If that the Turkish Fleete
4 920 Be not enshelter'd, and embay'd, they are drown'd,
4 921 It is impossible to beare it out.
4 922 Enter a Gentleman.
4 923 
4 924   3 Newes Laddes: our warres are done:
4 925 The desperate Tempest hath so bang'd the Turkes,
4 926 That their designement halts. A Noble ship of Venice,
4 927 Hath seene a greeuous wracke and sufferance
4 928 On most part of their Fleet
4 929 
4 930    Mon. How? Is this true?
4 931   3 The Ship is heere put in: A Verennessa, Michael Cassio
4 932 Lieutenant to the warlike Moore, Othello,
4 933 Is come on Shore: the Moore himselfe at Sea,
4 934 And is in full Commission heere for Cyprus
4 935 
4 936    Mon. I am glad on't:
4 937 'Tis a worthy Gouernour
4 938 
4 939    3 But this same Cassio, though he speake of comfort,
4 940 Touching the Turkish losse, yet he lookes sadly,
4 941 And praye the Moore be safe; for they were parted
4 942 With fowle and violent Tempest
4 943 
4 944    Mon. Pray Heauens he be:
4 945 For I haue seru'd him, and the man commands
4 946 Like a full Soldier. Let's to the Sea-side (hoa)
4 947 As well to see the Vessell that's come in,
4 948 As to throw-out our eyes for braue Othello,
4 949 Euen till we make the Maine, and th' Eriall blew,
4 950 An indistinct regard
4 951 
4 952    Gent. Come, let's do so;
4 953 For euery Minute is expectancie
4 954 Of more Arriuancie.
4 955 Enter Cassio.
4 956 
4 957   Cassi. Thankes you, the valiant of the warlike Isle,
4 958 That so approoue the Moore: Oh let the Heauens
4 959 Giue him defence against the Elements,
4 960 For I haue lost him on a dangerous Sea
4 961 
4 962    Mon. Is he well ship'd?
4 963   Cassio. His Barke is stoutly Timber'd, and his Pylot
4 964 Of verie expert, and approu'd Allowance;
4 965 Therefore my hope's (not surfetted to death)
4 966 Stand in bold Cure
4 967 
4 968    Within. A Saile, a Saile, a Saile
4 969 
4 970    Cassio. What noise?
4 971   Gent. The Towne is empty; on the brow o'th' Sea
4 972 Stand rankes of People and they cry, a Saile
4 973 
4 974    Cassio. My hopes do shape him for the Gouernor
4 975 
4 976    Gent. They do discharge their Shot of Courtesie,
4 977 Our Friends, at least
4 978 
4 979    Cassio. I pray you Sir, go forth,
4 980 And giue vs truth who 'tis that is arriu'd
4 981 
4 982    Gent. I shall.
4 983 Enter.
4 984 
4 985   Mon. But good Lieutenant, is your Generall wiu'd?
4 986   Cassio. Most fortunately: he hath atchieu'd a Maid
4 987 That paragons description, and wilde Fame:
4 988 One that excels the quirkes of Blazoning pens,
4 989 And in th' essentiall Vesture of Creation,
4 990 Do's tyre the Ingeniuer.
4 991 Enter Gentleman.
4 992 
4 993 How now? Who ha's put in?
4 994   Gent. 'Tis one Iago, Auncient to the Generall
4 995 
4 996    Cassio. Ha's had most fauourable, and happie speed:
4 997 Tempests themselues, high Seas, and howling windes,
4 998 The gutter'd-Rockes, and Congregated Sands,
4 999 Traitors ensteep'd, to enclogge the guiltlesse Keele,
4 1000 As hauing sence of Beautie, do omit
4 1001 Their mortall Natures, letting go safely by
4 1002 The Diuine Desdemona
4 1003 
4 1004    Mon. What is she?
4 1005   Cassio. She that I spake of:
4 1006 Our great Captains Captaine,
4 1007 Left in the conduct of the bold Iago,
4 1008 Whose footing heere anticipates our thoughts,
4 1009 A Senights speed. Great Ioue, Othello guard,
4 1010 And swell his Saile with thine owne powrefull breath,
4 1011 That he may blesse this Bay with his tall Ship,
4 1012 Make loues quicke pants in Desdemonaes Armes,
4 1013 Giue renew'd fire to our extincted Spirits.
4 1014 
4 1015 Enter Desdemona, Iago, Rodorigo, and Aemilia.
4 1016 
4 1017 Oh behold,
4 1018 The Riches of the Ship is come on shore:
4 1019 You men of Cyprus, let her haue your knees.
4 1020 Haile to thee Ladie: and the grace of Heauen,
4 1021 Before, behinde thee, and on euery hand
4 1022 Enwheele thee round
4 1023 
4 1024    Des. I thanke you, Valiant Cassio,
4 1025 What tydings can you tell of my Lord?
4 1026   Cas. He is not yet arriu'd, nor know I ought
4 1027 But that he's well, and will be shortly heere
4 1028 
4 1029    Des. Oh, but I feare:
4 1030 How lost you company?
4 1031   Cassio. The great Contention of Sea, and Skies
4 1032 Parted our fellowship. But hearke, a Saile
4 1033 
4 1034    Within. A Saile, a Saile
4 1035 
4 1036    Gent. They giue this greeting to the Cittadell:
4 1037 This likewise is a Friend
4 1038 
4 1039    Cassio. See for the Newes:
4 1040 Good Ancient, you are welcome. Welcome Mistris:
4 1041 Let it not gaule your patience (good Iago)
4 1042 That I extend my Manners. 'Tis my breeding,
4 1043 That giues me this bold shew of Curtesie
4 1044 
4 1045    Iago. Sir, would she giue you so much of her lippes,
4 1046 As of her tongue she oft bestowes on me,
4 1047 You would haue enough
4 1048 
4 1049    Des. Alas: she ha's no speech
4 1050 
4 1051    Iago. Infaith too much:
4 1052 I finde it still, when I haue leaue to sleepe.
4 1053 Marry before your Ladyship, I grant,
4 1054 She puts her tongue a little in her heart,
4 1055 And chides with thinking
4 1056 
4 1057    aemil. You haue little cause to say so
4 1058 
4 1059    Iago. Come on, come on: you are Pictures out of
4 1060 doore: Bells in your Parlours: Wilde-Cats in your Kitchens:
4 1061 Saints in your Iniuries: Diuels being offended:
4 1062 Players in your Huswiferie, and Huswiues in your
4 1063 Beds
4 1064 
4 1065    Des. Oh, fie vpon thee, Slanderer
4 1066 
4 1067    Iago. Nay, it is true: or else I am a Turke,
4 1068 You rise to play, and go to bed to worke.
4 1069 Aemil. You shall not write my praise
4 1070 
4 1071    Iago. No, let me not
4 1072 
4 1073    Desde. What would'st write of me, if thou should'st
4 1074 praise me?
4 1075   Iago. Oh, gentle Lady, do not put me too't,
4 1076 For I am nothing, if not Criticall
4 1077 
4 1078    Des. Come on, assay.
4 1079 There's one gone to the Harbour?
4 1080   Iago. I Madam
4 1081 
4 1082    Des. I am not merry: but I do beguile
4 1083 The thing I am, by seeming otherwise.
4 1084 Come, how would'st thou praise me?
4 1085   Iago. I am about it, but indeed my inuention comes
4 1086 from my pate, as Birdlyme do's from Freeze, it pluckes
4 1087 out Braines and all. But my Muse labours, and thus she
4 1088 is deliuer'd.
4 1089 If she be faire, and wise: fairenesse, and wit,
4 1090 The ones for vse, the other vseth it
4 1091 
4 1092    Des. Well prais'd:
4 1093 How if she be Blacke and Witty?
4 1094   Iago. If she be blacke, and thereto haue a wit,
4 1095 She'le find a white, that shall her blacknesse fit
4 1096 
4 1097    Des. Worse, and worse.
4 1098 Aemil. How if Faire, and Foolish?
4 1099   Iago. She neuer yet was foolish that was faire,
4 1100 For euen her folly helpt her to an heire
4 1101 
4 1102    Desde. These are old fond Paradoxes, to make Fooles
4 1103 laugh i'th' Alehouse. What miserable praise hast thou
4 1104 for her that's Foule, and Foolish
4 1105 
4 1106    Iago. There's none so foule and foolish thereunto,
4 1107 But do's foule pranks, which faire, and wise-ones do
4 1108 
4 1109    Desde. Oh heauy ignorance: thou praisest the worst
4 1110 best. But what praise could'st thou bestow on a deseruing
4 1111 woman indeed? One, that in the authorithy of her
4 1112 merit, did iustly put on the vouch of very malice it
4 1113 selfe
4 1114 
4 1115    Iago. She that was euer faire, and neuer proud,
4 1116 Had Tongue at will, and yet was neuer loud:
4 1117 Neuer lackt Gold, and yet went neuer gay,
4 1118 Fled from her wish, and yet said now I may.
4 1119 She that being angred, her reuenge being nie,
4 1120 Bad her wrong stay, and her displeasure flie:
4 1121 She that in wisedome neuer was so fraile,
4 1122 To change the Cods-head for the Salmons taile:
4 1123 She that could thinke, and neu'r disclose her mind,
4 1124 See Suitors following, and not looke behind:
4 1125 She was a wight, (if euer such wightes were)
4 1126   Des. To do what?
4 1127   Iago. To suckle Fooles, and chronicle small Beere
4 1128 
4 1129    Desde. Oh most lame and impotent conclusion. Do
4 1130 not learne of him aemillia, though he be thy husband.
4 1131 How say you (Cassio) is he not a most prophane, and liberall
4 1132 Counsailor?
4 1133   Cassio. He speakes home (Madam) you may rellish
4 1134 him more in the Souldier, then in the Scholler
4 1135 
4 1136    Iago. He takes her by the palme: I, well said, whisper.
4 1137 With as little a web as this, will I ensnare as great
4 1138 a Fly as Cassio. I smile vpon her, do: I will giue thee
4 1139 in thine owne Courtship. You say true, 'tis so indeed.
4 1140 If such tricks as these strip you out of your Lieutenantrie,
4 1141 it had beene better you had not kiss'd your three fingers
4 1142 so oft, which now againe you are most apt to play
4 1143 the Sir, in. Very good: well kiss'd, and excellent Curtsie:
4 1144 'tis so indeed. Yet againe, your fingers to your
4 1145 lippes? Would they were Cluster-pipes for your
4 1146 sake.
4 1147 The Moore I know his Trumpet
4 1148 
4 1149    Cassio. 'Tis truely so
4 1150 
4 1151    Des. Let's meete him, and recieue him
4 1152 
4 1153    Cassio. Loe, where he comes.
4 1154 Enter Othello, and Attendants.
4 1155 
4 1156   Oth. O, my faire Warriour
4 1157 
4 1158    Des. My deere Othello
4 1159 
4 1160    Othe. It giues me wonder great, as my content
4 1161 To see you heere before me.
4 1162 Oh my Soules Ioy:
4 1163 If after euery Tempest, come such Calmes,
4 1164 May the windes blow, till they haue waken'd death:
4 1165 And let the labouring Barke climbe hills of Seas
4 1166 Olympus high: and duck againe as low,
4 1167 As hell's from Heauen. If it were now to dye,
4 1168 'Twere now to be most happy. For I feare,
4 1169 My Soule hath her content so absolute,
4 1170 That not another comfort like to this,
4 1171 Succeedes in vnknowne Fate
4 1172 
4 1173    Des. The Heauens forbid
4 1174 But that our Loues
4 1175 And Comforts should encrease
4 1176 Euen as our dayes do grow
4 1177 
4 1178    Othe. Amen to that (sweet Powers)
4 1179 I cannot speake enough of this content,
4 1180 It stoppes me heere: it is too much of ioy.
4 1181 And this, and this the greatest discords be
4 1182 That ere our hearts shall make
4 1183 
4 1184    Iago. Oh you are well tun'd now: But Ile set downe
4 1185 the peggs that make this Musicke, as honest as I am
4 1186 
4 1187    Othe. Come: let vs to the Castle.
4 1188 Newes (Friends) our Warres are done:
4 1189 The Turkes are drown'd.
4 1190 How do's my old Acquaintance of this Isle?
4 1191 (Hony) you shall be well desir'd in Cyprus,
4 1192 I haue found great loue among'st them. Oh my Sweet,
4 1193 I prattle out of fashion, and I doate
4 1194 In mine owne comforts. I prythee, good Iago,
4 1195 Go to the Bay, and disimbarke my Coffers:
4 1196 Bring thou the Master to the Cittadell,
4 1197 He is a good one, and his worthynesse
4 1198 Do's challenge much respect. Come Desdemona,
4 1199 Once more well met at Cyprus.
4 1200 
4 1201 Exit Othello and Desdemona.
4 1202 
4 1203   Iago. Do thou meet me presently at the Harbour.
4 1204 Come thither, if thou be'st Valiant, (as they say base men
4 1205 being in Loue, haue then a Nobilitie in their Natures,
4 1206 more then is natiue to them) list-me; the Lieutenant to
4 1207 night watches on the Court of Guard. First, I must tell
4 1208 thee this: Desdemona, is directly in loue with him
4 1209 
4 1210    Rod. With him? Why, 'tis not possible
4 1211 
4 1212    Iago. Lay thy finger thus: and let thy soule be instructed.
4 1213 Marke me with what violence she first lou'd
4 1214 the Moore, but for bragging, and telling her fantasticall
4 1215 lies. To loue him still for prating, let not thy discreet
4 1216 heart thinke it. Her eye must be fed. And what delight
4 1217 shall she haue to looke on the diuell? When the Blood
4 1218 is made dull with the Act of Sport, there should be a
4 1219 game to enflame it, and to giue Satiety a fresh appetite.
4 1220 Louelinesse in fauour, simpathy in yeares, Manners,
4 1221 and Beauties: all which the Moore is defectiue in. Now
4 1222 for want of these requir'd Conueniences, her delicate
4 1223 tendernesse wil finde it selfe abus'd, begin to heaue the,
4 1224 gorge, disrellish and abhorre the Moore, very Nature wil
4 1225 instruct her in it, and compell her to some second choice.
4 1226 Now Sir, this granted (as it is a most pregnant and vnforc'd
4 1227 position) who stands so eminent in the degree of
4 1228 this Fortune, as Cassio do's: a knaue very voluble: no
4 1229 further conscionable, then in putting on the meere forme
4 1230 of Ciuill, and Humaine seeming, for the better compasse
4 1231 of his salt, and most hidden loose Affection? Why none,
4 1232 why none: A slipper, and subtle knaue, a finder of occasion:
4 1233 that he's an eye can stampe, and counterfeit Aduantages,
4 1234 though true Aduantage neuer present it selfe.
4 1235 A diuelish knaue: besides, the knaue is handsome, young:
4 1236 and hath all those requisites in him, that folly and greene
4 1237 mindes looke after. A pestilent compleat knaue, and the
4 1238 woman hath found him already
4 1239 
4 1240    Rodo. I cannot beleeue that in her, she's full of most
4 1241 bless'd condition
4 1242 
4 1243    Iago. Bless'd figges-end. The Wine she drinkes is
4 1244 made of grapes. If shee had beene bless'd, shee would
4 1245 neuer haue lou'd the Moore: Bless'd pudding. Didst thou
4 1246 not see her paddle with the palme of his hand? Didst not
4 1247 marke that?
4 1248   Rod. Yes, that I did: but that was but curtesie
4 1249 
4 1250    Iago . Leacherie by this hand: an Index, and obscure
4 1251 prologue to the History of Lust and foule Thoughts.
4 1252 They met so neere with their lippes, that their breathes
4 1253 embrac'd together. Villanous thoughts Rodorigo, when
4 1254 these mutabilities so marshall the way, hard at hand
4 1255 comes the Master, and maine exercise, th' incorporate
4 1256 conclusion: Pish. But Sir, be you rul'd by me. I haue
4 1257 brought you from Venice. Watch you to night: for
4 1258 the Command, Ile lay't vpon you. Cassio knowes you
4 1259 not: Ile not be farre from you. Do you finde some occasion
4 1260 to anger Cassio, either by speaking too loud, or
4 1261 tainting his discipline, or from what other course
4 1262 you please, which the time shall more fauorably minister
4 1263 
4 1264    Rod. Well
4 1265 
4 1266    Iago. Sir, he's rash, and very sodaine in Choller: and
4 1267 happely may strike at you, prouoke him that he may: for
4 1268 euen out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to Mutiny.
4 1269 Whose qualification shall come into no true taste againe,
4 1270 but by the displanting of Cassio. So shall you
4 1271 haue a shorter iourney to your desires, by the meanes I
4 1272 shall then haue to preferre them. And the impediment
4 1273 most profitably remoued, without the which there were
4 1274 no expectation of our prosperitie
4 1275 
4 1276    Rodo. I will do this, if you can bring it to any opportunity
4 1277 
4 1278    Iago. I warrant thee. Meete me by and by at the
4 1279 Cittadell. I must fetch his Necessaries a Shore. Farewell
4 1280 
4 1281    Rodo. Adieu.
4 1282 Enter.
4 1283 
4 1284   Iago. That Cassio loues her, I do well beleeu't:
4 1285 That she loues him, 'tis apt, and of great Credite.
4 1286 The Moore (howbeit that I endure him not)
4 1287 Is of a constant, louing, Noble Nature,
4 1288 And I dare thinke, he'le proue to Desdemona
4 1289 A most deere husband. Now I do loue her too,
4 1290 Not out of absolute Lust, (though peraduenture
4 1291 I stand accomptant for as great a sin)
4 1292 But partely led to dyet my Reuenge,
4 1293 For that I do suspect the lustie Moore
4 1294 Hath leap'd into my Seate. The thought whereof,
4 1295 Doth (like a poysonous Minerall) gnaw my Inwardes:
4 1296 And nothing can, or shall content my Soule
4 1297 Till I am eeuen'd with him, wife, for wife.
4 1298 Or fayling so, yet that I put the Moore,
4 1299 At least into a Ielouzie so strong
4 1300 That iudgement cannot cure. Which thing to do,
4 1301 If this poore Trash of Venice, whom I trace
4 1302 For his quicke hunting, stand the putting on,
4 1303 Ile haue our Michael Cassio on the hip,
4 1304 Abuse him to the Moore, in the right garbe
4 1305 (For I feare Cassio with my Night-Cape too)
4 1306 Make the Moore thanke me, loue me, and reward me,
4 1307 For making him egregiously an Asse,
4 1308 And practising vpon his peace, and quiet,
4 1309 Euen to madnesse. 'Tis heere: but yet confus'd,
4 1310 Knaueries plaine face, is neuer seene, till vs'd.
4 1311 Enter.
4 1312 
4 1313 
4 1314 Scena Secunda.
4 1315 
4 1316 Enter Othello's Herald with a Proclamation.
4 1317 
4 1318   Herald. It is Othello's pleasure, our Noble and Valiant
4 1319 Generall. That vpon certaine tydings now arriu'd,
4 1320 importing the meere perdition of the Turkish Fleete:
4 1321 euery man put himselfe into Triumph. Some to daunce,
4 1322 some to make Bonfires, each man, to what Sport and
4 1323 Reuels his addition leads him. For besides these beneficiall
4 1324 Newes, it is the Celebration of his Nuptiall. So
4 1325 much was his pleasure should be proclaimed. All offices
4 1326 are open, & there is full libertie of Feasting from this
4 1327 present houre of fiue, till the Bell haue told eleuen.
4 1328 Blesse the Isle of Cyprus, and our Noble Generall Othello.
4 1329 Enter.
4 1330 
4 1331 Enter Othello, Desdemona, Cassio, and Attendants.
4 1332 
4 1333   Othe. Good Michael, looke you to the guard to night.
4 1334 Let's teach our selues that Honourable stop,
4 1335 Not to out-sport discretion
4 1336 
4 1337    Cas. Iago, hath direction what to do.
4 1338 But notwithstanding with my personall eye
4 1339 Will I looke to't
4 1340 
4 1341    Othe. Iago, is most honest:
4 1342 Michael, goodnight. To morrow with your earliest,
4 1343 Let me haue speech with you. Come my deere Loue,
4 1344 The purchase made, the fruites are to ensue,
4 1345 That profit's yet to come 'tweene me, and you.
4 1346 Goodnight.
4 1347 Enter.
4 1348 
4 1349 Enter Iago.
4 1350 
4 1351   Cas. Welcome Iago: we must to the Watch
4 1352 
4 1353    Iago. Not this houre Lieutenant: 'tis not yet ten
4 1354 o'th' clocke. Our Generall cast vs thus earely for the
4 1355 loue of his Desdemona: Who, let vs not therefore blame;
4 1356 he hath not yet made wanton the night with her: and
4 1357 she is sport for Ioue
4 1358 
4 1359    Cas. She's a most exquisite Lady
4 1360 
4 1361    Iago. And Ile warrant her, full of Game
4 1362 
4 1363    Cas. Indeed shes a most fresh and delicate creature
4 1364 
4 1365    Iago. What an eye she ha's?
4 1366 Me thinkes it sounds a parley to prouocation
4 1367 
4 1368    Cas. An inuiting eye:
4 1369 And yet me thinkes right modest
4 1370 
4 1371    Iago. And when she speakes,
4 1372 Is it not an Alarum to Loue?
4 1373   Cas. She is indeed perfection
4 1374 
4 1375    Iago. Well: happinesse to their Sheetes. Come Lieutenant,
4 1376 I haue a stope of Wine, and heere without are a
4 1377 brace of Cyprus Gallants, that would faine haue a measure
4 1378 to the health of blacke Othello
4 1379 
4 1380    Cas. Not to night, good Iago, I haue very poore,
4 1381 and vnhappie Braines for drinking. I could well wish
4 1382 Curtesie would inuent some other Custome of entertainment
4 1383 
4 1384    Iago. Oh, they are our Friends: but one Cup, Ile
4 1385 drinke for you
4 1386 
4 1387    Cassio. I haue drunke but one Cup to night, and that
4 1388 was craftily qualified too: and behold what inouation
4 1389 it makes heere. I am infortunate in the infirmity, and
4 1390 dare not taske my weakenesse with any more
4 1391 
4 1392    Iago. What man? 'Tis a night of Reuels, the Gallants
4 1393 desire it
4 1394 
4 1395    Cas. Where are they?
4 1396   Iago. Heere, at the doore: I pray you call them in
4 1397 
4 1398    Cas. Ile do't, but it dislikes me.
4 1399 Enter.
4 1400 
4 1401   Iago. If I can fasten but one Cup vpon him
4 1402 With that which he hath drunke to night alreadie,
4 1403 He'l be as full of Quarrell, and offence
4 1404 As my yong Mistris dogge.
4 1405 Now my sicke Foole Rodorigo,
4 1406 Whom Loue hath turn'd almost the wrong side out,
4 1407 To Desdemona hath to night Carrows'd.
4 1408 Potations, pottle-deepe; and he's to watch.
4 1409 Three else of Cyprus, Noble swelling Spirites,
4 1410 (That hold their Honours in a wary distance,
4 1411 The very Elements of this Warrelike Isle)
4 1412 Haue I to night fluster'd with flowing Cups,
4 1413 And they Watch too.
4 1414 Now 'mongst this Flocke of drunkards
4 1415 Am I put to our Cassio in some Action
4 1416 That may offend the Isle. But here they come.
4 1417 Enter Cassio, Montano, and Gentlemen.
4 1418 
4 1419 If Consequence do but approue my dreame,
4 1420 My Boate sailes freely, both with winde and Streame
4 1421 
4 1422    Cas. 'Fore heauen, they haue giuen me a rowse already
4 1423 
4 1424    Mon. Good-faith a litle one: not past a pint, as I am a
4 1425 Souldier
4 1426 
4 1427    Iago. Some Wine hoa.
4 1428 And let me the Cannakin clinke, clinke:
4 1429 And let me the Cannakin clinke.
4 1430 A Souldiers a man: Oh, mans life's but a span,
4 1431 Why then let a Souldier drinke.
4 1432 Some Wine Boyes
4 1433 
4 1434    Cas. 'Fore Heauen: an excellent Song
4 1435 
4 1436    Iago. I learn'd it in England: where indeed they are
4 1437 most potent in Potting. Your Dane, your Germaine,
4 1438 and your swag-belly'd Hollander, (drinke hoa) are
4 1439 nothing to your English
4 1440 
4 1441    Cassio. Is your Englishmen so exquisite in his drinking?
4 1442   Iago. Why, he drinkes you with facillitie, your Dane
4 1443 dead drunke. He sweates not to ouerthrow your Almaine.
4 1444 He giues your Hollander a vomit, ere the next
4 1445 Pottle can be fill'd
4 1446 
4 1447    Cas. To the health of our Generall
4 1448 
4 1449    Mon. I am for it Lieutenant: and Ile do you Iustice
4 1450 
4 1451    Iago. Oh sweet England.
4 1452 King Stephen was anda worthy Peere,
4 1453 His Breeches cost him but a Crowne,
4 1454 He held them Six pence all to deere,
4 1455 With that he cal'd the Tailor Lowne:
4 1456 He was a wight of high Renowne,
4 1457 And thou art but of low degree:
4 1458 'Tis Pride that pulls the Country downe,
4 1459 And take thy awl'd Cloake about thee.
4 1460 Some Wine hoa
4 1461 
4 1462    Cassio. Why this is a more exquisite Song then the other
4 1463 
4 1464    Iago. Will you heare't againe?
4 1465   Cas. No: for I hold him to be vnworthy of his Place,
4 1466 that do's those things. Well: heau'ns aboue all: and
4 1467 there be soules must be saued, and there be soules must
4 1468 not be saued
4 1469 
4 1470    Iago. It's true, good Lieutenant
4 1471 
4 1472    Cas. For mine owne part, no offence to the Generall,
4 1473 nor any man of qualitie: I hope to be saued
4 1474 
4 1475    Iago. And so do I too Lieutenant
4 1476 
4 1477    Cassio. I: (but by your leaue) not before me. The
4 1478 Lieutenant is to be saued before the Ancient. Let's haue
4 1479 no more of this: let's to our Affaires. Forgiue vs our
4 1480 sinnes: Gentlemen let's looke to our businesse. Do not
4 1481 thinke Gentlemen, I am drunke: this is my Ancient, this
4 1482 is my right hand, and this is my left. I am not drunke
4 1483 now: I can stand well enough, and I speake well enough
4 1484 
4 1485    Gent. Excellent well
4 1486 
4 1487    Cas. Why very well then: you must not thinke then,
4 1488 that I am drunke.
4 1489 Enter.
4 1490 
4 1491   Monta. To th' Platforme (Masters) come, let's set the
4 1492 Watch
4 1493 
4 1494    Iago. You see this Fellow, that is gone before,
4 1495 He's a Souldier, fit to stand by Caesar,
4 1496 And giue direction. And do but see his vice,
4 1497 'Tis to his vertue, a iust Equinox,
4 1498 The one as long as th' other. 'Tis pittie of him:
4 1499 I feare the trust Othello puts him in,
4 1500 On some odde time of his infirmitie
4 1501 Will shake this Island
4 1502 
4 1503    Mont. But is he often thus?
4 1504   Iago. 'Tis euermore his prologue to his sleepe,
4 1505 He'le watch the Horologe a double Set,
4 1506 If Drinke rocke not his Cradle
4 1507 
4 1508    Mont. It were well
4 1509 The Generall were put in mind of it:
4 1510 Perhaps he sees it not, or his good nature
4 1511 Prizes the vertue that appeares in Cassio,
4 1512 And lookes not on his euills: is not this true?
4 1513 Enter Rodorigo.
4 1514 
4 1515   Iago. How now Rodorigo?
4 1516 I pray you after the Lieutenant, go
4 1517 
4 1518    Mon. And 'tis great pitty, that the Noble Moore
4 1519 Should hazard such a Place, as his owne Second
4 1520 With one of an ingraft Infirmitie,
4 1521 It were an honest Action, to say so
4 1522 To the Moore
4 1523 
4 1524    Iago. Not I, for this faire Island,
4 1525 I do loue Cassio well: and would do much
4 1526 To cure him of this euill, But hearke, what noise?
4 1527 Enter Cassio pursuing Rodorigo.
4 1528 
4 1529   Cas. You Rogue: you Rascall
4 1530 
4 1531    Mon. What's the matter Lieutenant?
4 1532   Cas. A Knaue teach me my dutie? Ile beate the
4 1533 Knaue in to a Twiggen-Bottle
4 1534 
4 1535    Rod. Beate me?
4 1536   Cas. Dost thou prate, Rogue?
4 1537   Mon. Nay, good Lieutenant:
4 1538 I pray you Sir, hold your hand
4 1539 
4 1540    Cassio. Let me go (Sir)
4 1541 Or Ile knocke you o're the Mazard
4 1542 
4 1543    Mon. Come, come: you're drunke
4 1544 
4 1545    Cassio. Drunke?
4 1546   Iago. Away I say: go out and cry a Mutinie.
4 1547 Nay good Lieutenant. Alas Gentlemen:
4 1548 Helpe hoa. Lieutenant. Sir Montano:
4 1549 Helpe Masters. Heere's a goodly Watch indeed.
4 1550 Who's that which rings the Bell: Diablo, hoa:
4 1551 The Towne will rise. Fie, fie Lieutenant,
4 1552 You'le be asham'd for euer.
4 1553 Enter Othello, and Attendants.
4 1554 
4 1555   Othe. What is the matter heere?
4 1556   Mon. I bleed still, I am hurt to th' death. He dies
4 1557 
4 1558    Othe. Hold for your liues
4 1559 
4 1560    Iag. Hold hoa: Lieutenant, Sir Montano, Gentlemen:
4 1561 Haue you forgot all place of sense and dutie?
4 1562 Hold. The Generall speaks to you: hold for shame
4 1563 
4 1564    Oth. Why how now hoa? From whence ariseth this?
4 1565 Are we turn'd Turkes? and to our selues do that
4 1566 Which Heauen hath forbid the Ottamittes.
4 1567 For Christian shame, put by this barbarous Brawle:
4 1568 He that stirs next, to carue for his owne rage,
4 1569 Holds his soule light: He dies vpon his Motion.
4 1570 Silence that dreadfull Bell, it frights the Isle,
4 1571 From her propriety. What is the matter, Masters?
4 1572 Honest Iago, that lookes dead with greeuing,
4 1573 Speake: who began this? On thy loue I charge thee?
4 1574   Iago. I do not know: Friends all, but now, euen now.
4 1575 In Quarter, and in termes like Bride, and Groome
4 1576 Deuesting them for Bed: and then, but now:
4 1577 (As if some Planet had vnwitted men)
4 1578 Swords out, and tilting one at others breastes,
4 1579 In opposition bloody. I cannot speake
4 1580 Any begining to this peeuish oddes.
4 1581 And would, in Action glorious, I had lost
4 1582 Those legges, that brought me to a part of it
4 1583 
4 1584    Othe. How comes it (Michaell) you are thus forgot?
4 1585   Cas. I pray you pardon me, I cannot speake
4 1586 
4 1587    Othe. Worthy Montano, you were wont to be ciuill:
4 1588 The grauitie, and stillnesse of your youth
4 1589 The world hath noted. And your name is great
4 1590 In mouthes of wisest Censure. What's the matter
4 1591 That you vnlace your reputation thus,
4 1592 And spend your rich opinion, for the name
4 1593 Of a night-brawler? Giue me answer to it
4 1594 
4 1595    Mon. Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger,
4 1596 Your Officer Iago, can informe you,
4 1597 While I spare speech which something now offends me.
4 1598 Of all that I do know, nor know I ought
4 1599 By me, that's said, or done amisse this night,
4 1600 Vnlesse selfe-charitie be sometimes a vice,
4 1601 And to defend our selues, it be a sinne
4 1602 When violence assailes vs
4 1603 
4 1604    Othe. Now by Heauen,
4 1605 My blood begins my safer Guides to rule,
4 1606 And passion (hauing my best iudgement collied)
4 1607 Assaies to leade the way. If I once stir,
4 1608 Or do but lift this Arme, the best of you
4 1609 Shall sinke in my rebuke. Giue me to know
4 1610 How this foule Rout began: Who set it on,
4 1611 And he that is approu'd in this offence,
4 1612 Though he had twinn'd with me, both at a birth,
4 1613 Shall loose me. What in a Towne of warre,
4 1614 Yet wilde, the peoples hearts brim-full of feare,
4 1615 To Manage priuate, and domesticke Quarrell?
4 1616 In night, and on the Court and Guard of safetie?
4 1617 'Tis monstrous: Iago, who began't?
4 1618   Mon. If partially Affin'd, or league in office,
4 1619 Thou dost deliuer more, or lesse then Truth,
4 1620 Thou art no Souldier
4 1621 
4 1622    Iago. Touch me not so neere,
4 1623 I had rather haue this tongue cut from my mouth,
4 1624 Then it should do offence to Michaell Cassio.
4 1625 Yet I perswade my selfe, to speake the truth
4 1626 Shall nothing wrong him. This it is Generall:
4 1627 Montano and my selfe being in speech,
4 1628 There comes a Fellow, crying out for helpe,
4 1629 And Cassio following him with determin'd Sword
4 1630 To execute vpon him. Sir, this Gentleman,
4 1631 Steppes in to Cassio, and entreats his pause:
4 1632 My selfe, the crying Fellow did pursue,
4 1633 Least by his clamour (as it so fell out)
4 1634 The Towne might fall in fright. He, (swift of foote)
4 1635 Out-ran my purpose: and I return'd then rather
4 1636 For that I heard the clinke, and fall of Swords,
4 1637 And Cassio high in oath: Which till to night
4 1638 I nere might say before. When I came backe
4 1639 (For this was briefe) I found them close together
4 1640 At blow, and thrust, euen as againe they were
4 1641 When you your selfe did part them.
4 1642 More of this matter cannot I report,
4 1643 But Men are Men: The best sometimes forget,
4 1644 Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,
4 1645 As men in rage strike those that wish them best,
4 1646 Yet surely Cassio, I beleeue receiu'd
4 1647 From him that fled, some strange Indignitie,
4 1648 Which patience could not passe
4 1649 
4 1650    Othe. I know Iago
4 1651 Thy honestie, and loue doth mince this matter,
4 1652 Making it light to Cassio: Cassio, I loue thee,
4 1653 But neuer more be Officer of mine.
4 1654 Enter Desdemona attended.
4 1655 
4 1656 Looke if my gentle Loue be not rais'd vp:
4 1657 Ile make thee an example
4 1658 
4 1659    Des. What is the matter (Deere?)
4 1660   Othe. All's well, Sweeting:
4 1661 Come away to bed. Sir for your hurts,
4 1662 My selfe will be your Surgeon. Lead him off:
4 1663 Iago, looke with care about the Towne,
4 1664 And silence those whom this vil'd brawle distracted.
4 1665 Come Desdemona, 'tis the Soldiers life,
4 1666 To haue their Balmy slumbers wak'd with strife.
4 1667 Enter.
4 1668 
4 1669   Iago. What are you hurt Lieutenant?
4 1670   Cas. I, past all Surgery
4 1671 
4 1672    Iago. Marry Heauen forbid
4 1673 
4 1674    Cas. Reputation, Reputation, Reputation: Oh I haue
4 1675 lost my Reputation. I haue lost the immortall part of
4 1676 myselfe, and what remaines is bestiall. My Reputation,
4 1677 Iago, my Reputation
4 1678 
4 1679    Iago. As I am an honest man I had thought you had
4 1680 receiued some bodily wound; there is more sence in that
4 1681 then in Reputation. Reputation is an idle, and most false
4 1682 imposition; oft got without merit, and lost without deseruing.
4 1683 You haue lost no Reputation at all, vnlesse you
4 1684 repute your selfe such a looser. What man, there are
4 1685 more wayes to recouer the Generall againe. You are
4 1686 but now cast in his moode, (a punishment more in policie,
4 1687 then in malice) euen so as one would beate his offencelesse
4 1688 dogge, to affright an Imperious Lyon. Sue to
4 1689 him againe, and he's yours
4 1690 
4 1691    Cas. I will rather sue to be despis'd, then to deceiue
4 1692 so good a Commander, with so slight, so drunken, and so
4 1693 indiscreet an Officer. Drunke? And speake Parrat? And
4 1694 squabble? Swagger? Sweare? And discourse Fustian
4 1695 with ones owne shadow? Oh thou invisible spirit of
4 1696 Wine, if thou hast no name to be knowne by, let vs call
4 1697 thee Diuell
4 1698 
4 1699    Iago. What was he that you follow'd with your
4 1700 Sword? What had he done to you?
4 1701   Cas. I know not
4 1702 
4 1703    Iago. Is't possible?
4 1704   Cas. I remember a masse of things, but nothing distinctly:
4 1705 a Quarrell, but nothing wherefore. Oh, that
4 1706 men should put an Enemie in their mouthes, to steale away
4 1707 their Braines? that we should with ioy, pleasance,
4 1708 reuell and applause, transforme our selues into Beasts
4 1709 
4 1710    Iago. Why? But you are now well enough: how
4 1711 came you thus recouered?
4 1712   Cas. It hath pleas'd the diuell drunkennesse, to giue
4 1713 place to the diuell wrath, one vnperfectnesse, shewes me
4 1714 another to make me frankly despise my selfe
4 1715 
4 1716    Iago. Come, you are too seuere a Moraller. As the
4 1717 Time, the Place, & the Condition of this Country stands
4 1718 I could hartily wish this had not befalne: but since it is, as
4 1719 it is, mend it for your owne good
4 1720 
4 1721    Cas. I will aske him for my Place againe, he shall tell
4 1722 me, I am a drunkard: had I as many mouthes as Hydra,
4 1723 such an answer would stop them all. To be now a sensible
4 1724 man, by and by a Foole, and presently a Beast. Oh
4 1725 strange! Euery inordinate cup is vnbless'd, and the Ingredient
4 1726 is a diuell
4 1727 
4 1728    Iago. Come, come: good wine, is a good familiar
4 1729 Creature, if it be well vs'd: exclaime no more against it.
4 1730 And good Lieutenant, I thinke, you thinke I loue
4 1731 you
4 1732 
4 1733    Cassio. I haue well approued it, Sir. I drunke?
4 1734   Iago. You, or any man liuing, may be drunke at a
4 1735 time man. I tell you what you shall do: Our General's
4 1736 Wife, is now the Generall. I may say so, in this respect,
4 1737 for that he hath deuoted, and giuen vp himselfe to the
4 1738 Contemplation, marke: and deuotement of her parts
4 1739 and Graces. Confesse your selfe freely to her: Importune
4 1740 her helpe to put you in your place againe. She is
4 1741 of so free, so kinde, so apt, so blessed a disposition,
4 1742 she holds it a vice in her goodnesse, not to do more
4 1743 then she is requested. This broken ioynt betweene
4 1744 you, and her husband, entreat her to splinter. And my
4 1745 Fortunes against any lay worth naming, this cracke of
4 1746 your Loue, shall grow stronger, then it was before
4 1747 
4 1748    Cassio. You aduise me well
4 1749 
4 1750    Iago. I protest in the sinceritie of Loue, and honest
4 1751 kindnesse
4 1752 
4 1753    Cassio. I thinke it freely: and betimes in the morning,
4 1754 I will beseech the vertuous Desdemona to vndertake
4 1755 for me: I am desperate of my Fortunes if they check me
4 1756 
4 1757    Iago. You are in the right: good night Lieutenant, I
4 1758 must to the Watch
4 1759 
4 1760    Cassio. Good night, honest Iago.
4 1761 
4 1762 Exit Cassio.
4 1763 
4 1764   Iago. And what's he then,
4 1765 That saies I play the Villaine?
4 1766 When this aduise is free I giue, and honest,
4 1767 Proball to thinking, and indeed the course
4 1768 To win the Moore againe.
4 1769 For 'tis most easie
4 1770 Th' inclyning Desdemona to subdue
4 1771 In any honest Suite. She's fram'd as fruitefull
4 1772 As the free Elements. And then for her
4 1773 To win the Moore, were to renownce his Baptisme,
4 1774 All Seales, and Simbols of redeemed sin:
4 1775 His Soule is so enfetter'd to her Loue,
4 1776 That she may make, vnmake, do what she list,
4 1777 Euen as her Appetite shall play the God,
4 1778 With his weake Function. How am I then a Villaine,
4 1779 To Counsell Cassio to this paralell course,
4 1780 Directly to his good? Diuinitie of hell,
4 1781 When diuels will the blackest sinnes put on,
4 1782 They do suggest at first with heauenly shewes,
4 1783 As I do now. For whiles this honest Foole
4 1784 Plies Desdemona, to repaire his Fortune,
4 1785 And she for him, pleades strongly to the Moore,
4 1786 Ile powre this pestilence into his eare:
4 1787 That she repeales him, for her bodies Lust,
4 1788 And by how much she striues to do him good,
4 1789 She shall vndo her Credite with the Moore.
4 1790 So will I turne her vertue into pitch.
4 1791 And out of her owne goodnesse make the Net,
4 1792 That shall en-mash them all.
4 1793 How now Rodorigo?
4 1794 Enter Rodorigo.
4 1795 
4 1796   Rodorigo. I do follow heere in the Chace, not
4 1797 like a Hound that hunts, but one that filles vp the
4 1798 Crie. My Money is almost spent; I haue bin to night
4 1799 exceedingly well Cudgell'd: And I thinke the issue
4 1800 will bee, I shall haue so much experience for my paines;
4 1801 And so, with no money at all, and a little more Wit, returne
4 1802 againe to Venice
4 1803 
4 1804    Iago. How poore are they that haue not Patience?
4 1805 What wound did euer heale but by degrees?
4 1806 Thou know'st we worke by Wit, and not by Witchcraft
4 1807 And Wit depends on dilatory time:
4 1808 Dos't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee,
4 1809 And thou by that small hurt hath casheer'd Cassio:
4 1810 Though other things grow faire against the Sun,
4 1811 Yet Fruites that blossome first, will first be ripe:
4 1812 Content thy selfe, a-while. Introth 'tis Morning;
4 1813 Pleasure, and Action, make the houres seeme short.
4 1814 Retire thee, go where thou art Billited:
4 1815 Away, I say, thou shalt know more heereafter:
4 1816 Nay get thee gone.
4 1817 
4 1818 Exit Roderigo.
4 1819 
4 1820 Two things are to be done:
4 1821 My Wife must moue for Cassio to her Mistris:
4 1822 Ile set her on my selfe, a while, to draw the Moor apart,
4 1823 And bring him iumpe, when he may Cassio finde
4 1824 Soliciting his wife: I, that's the way:
4 1825 Dull not Deuice, by coldnesse, and delay.
4 1826 Enter.
4 1827 
4 1828 
4 1829 Actus Tertius. Scena Prima.
4 1830 
4 1831 Enter Cassio, Musitians, and Clowne.
4 1832 
4 1833   Cassio. Masters, play heere, I wil content your paines,
4 1834 Something that's briefe: and bid, goodmorrow General
4 1835 
4 1836    Clo. Why Masters, haue your Instruments bin in Naples,
4 1837 that they speake i'th' Nose thus?
4 1838   Mus. How Sir? how?
4 1839   Clo. Are these I pray you, winde Instruments?
4 1840   Mus. I marry are they sir
4 1841 
4 1842    Clo. Oh, thereby hangs a tale
4 1843 
4 1844    Mus. Whereby hangs a tale, sir?
4 1845   Clow. Marry sir, by many a winde Instrument that I
4 1846 know. But Masters, heere's money for you: and the Generall
4 1847 so likes your Musick, that he desires you for loues
4 1848 sake to make no more noise with it
4 1849 
4 1850    Mus. Well Sir, we will not
4 1851 
4 1852    Clo. If you haue any Musicke that may not be heard,
4 1853 too't againe. But (as they say) to heare Musicke, the Generall
4 1854 do's not greatly care
4 1855 
4 1856    Mus. We haue none such, sir
4 1857 
4 1858    Clow. Then put vp your Pipes in your bagge, for Ile
4 1859 away. Go, vanish into ayre, away.
4 1860 
4 1861 Exit Mu.
4 1862 
4 1863   Cassio. Dost thou heare me, mine honest Friend?
4 1864   Clo. No, I heare not your honest Friend:
4 1865 I heare you
4 1866 
4 1867    Cassio. Prythee keepe vp thy Quillets, ther's a poore
4 1868 peece of Gold for thee: if the Gentlewoman that attends
4 1869 the Generall be stirring, tell her, there's one Cassio entreats
4 1870 her a little fauour of Speech. Wilt thou do this?
4 1871   Clo. She is stirring sir: if she will stirre hither, I shall
4 1872 seeme to notifie vnto her.
4 1873 
4 1874 Exit Clo.
4 1875 
4 1876 Enter Iago.
4 1877 
4 1878 In happy time, Iago
4 1879 
4 1880    Iago. You haue not bin a-bed then?
4 1881   Cassio. Why no: the day had broke before we parted.
4 1882 I haue made bold (Iago) to send in to your wife:
4 1883 My suite to her is, that she will to vertuous Desdemona
4 1884 Procure me some accesse
4 1885 
4 1886    Iago. Ile send her to you presently:
4 1887 And Ile deuise a meane to draw the Moore
4 1888 Out of the way, that your conuerse and businesse
4 1889 May be more free.
4 1890 
4 1891 Exit
4 1892 
4 1893   Cassio. I humbly thanke you for't. I neuer knew
4 1894 A Florentine more kinde, and honest.
4 1895 Enter aemilia.
4 1896 
4 1897 Aemil. Goodmorrow (good Lieutenant) I am sorrie
4 1898 For your displeasure: but all will sure be well.
4 1899 The Generall and his wife are talking of it,
4 1900 And she speakes for you stoutly. The Moore replies,
4 1901 That he you hurt is of great Fame in Cyprus,
4 1902 And great Affinitie: and that in wholsome Wisedome
4 1903 He might not but refuse you. But he protests he loues you
4 1904 And needs no other Suitor, but his likings
4 1905 To bring you in againe
4 1906 
4 1907    Cassio. Yet I beseech you,
4 1908 If you thinke fit, or that it may be done,
4 1909 Giue me aduantage of some breefe Discourse
4 1910 With Desdemon alone.
4 1911 Aemil. Pray you come in:
4 1912 I will bestow you where you shall haue time
4 1913 To speake your bosome freely
4 1914 
4 1915    Cassio. I am much bound to you.
4 1916 
4 1917 Scoena Secunda.
4 1918 
4 1919 Enter Othello, Iago, and Gentlemen.
4 1920 
4 1921   Othe. These Letters giue (Iago) to the Pylot,
4 1922 And by him do my duties to the Senate:
4 1923 That done, I will be walking on the Workes,
4 1924 Repaire there to mee
4 1925 
4 1926    Iago. Well, my good Lord, Ile doo't
4 1927 
4 1928    Oth. This Fortification (Gentlemen) shall we see't?
4 1929   Gent. Well waite vpon your Lordship.
4 1930 
4 1931 Exeunt.
4 1932 
4 1933 Scoena Tertia.
4 1934 
4 1935 Enter Desdemona, Cassio, and aemilia.
4 1936 
4 1937   Des. Be thou assur'd (good Cassio) I will do
4 1938 All my abilities in thy behalfe.
4 1939 Aemil. Good Madam do:
4 1940 I warrant it greeues my Husband,
4 1941 As if the cause were his
4 1942 
4 1943    Des. Oh that's an honest Fellow, Do not doubt Cassio
4 1944 But I will haue my Lord, and you againe
4 1945 As friendly as you were
4 1946 
4 1947    Cassio. Bounteous Madam,
4 1948 What euer shall become of Michael Cassio,
4 1949 He's neuer any thing but your true Seruant
4 1950 
4 1951    Des. I know't: I thanke you: you do loue my Lord:
4 1952 You haue knowne him long, and be you well assur'd
4 1953 He shall in strangenesse stand no farther off,
4 1954 Then in a politique distance
4 1955 
4 1956    Cassio. I, but Lady,
4 1957 That policie may either last so long,
4 1958 Or feede vpon such nice and waterish diet,
4 1959 Or breede it selfe so out of Circumstances,
4 1960 That I being absent, and my place supply'd,
4 1961 My Generall will forget my Loue, and Seruice
4 1962 
4 1963    Des. Do not doubt that: before aemilia here,
4 1964 I giue thee warrant of thy place. Assure thee,
4 1965 If I do vow a friendship, Ile performe it
4 1966 To the last Article. My Lord shall neuer rest,
4 1967 Ile watch him tame, and talke him out of patience;
4 1968 His Bed shall seeme a Schoole, his Boord a Shrift,
4 1969 Ile intermingle euery thing he do's
4 1970 With Cassio's suite: Therefore be merry Cassio,
4 1971 For thy Solicitor shall rather dye,
4 1972 Then giue thy cause away.
4 1973 Enter Othello, and Iago.
4 1974 
4 1975 Aemil. Madam, heere comes my Lord
4 1976 
4 1977    Cassio. Madam, Ile take my leaue
4 1978 
4 1979    Des. Why stay, and heare me speake
4 1980 
4 1981    Cassio. Madam, not now: I am very ill at ease,
4 1982 Vnfit for mine owne purposes
4 1983 
4 1984    Des. Well, do your discretion.
4 1985 
4 1986 Exit Cassio.
4 1987 
4 1988   Iago. Hah? I like not that
4 1989 
4 1990    Othel. What dost thou say?
4 1991   Iago. Nothing my Lord; or if- I know not what
4 1992 
4 1993    Othel. Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?
4 1994   Iago. Cassio my Lord? No sure, I cannot thinke it
4 1995 That he would steale away so guilty-like,
4 1996 Seeing your comming
4 1997 
4 1998    Oth. I do beleeue 'twas he
4 1999 
4 2000    Des. How now my Lord?
4 2001 I haue bin talking with a Suitor heere,
4 2002 A man that languishes in your displeasure
4 2003 
4 2004    Oth. Who is't you meane?
4 2005   Des. Why your Lieutenant Cassio: Good my Lord,
4 2006 If I haue any grace, or power to moue you,
4 2007 His present reconciliation take.
4 2008 For if he be not one, that truly loues you,
4 2009 That erres in Ignorance, and not in Cunning,
4 2010 I haue no iudgement in an honest face.
4 2011 I prythee call him backe
4 2012 
4 2013    Oth. Went he hence now?
4 2014   Des. I sooth; so humbled,
4 2015 That he hath left part of his greefe with mee
4 2016 To suffer with him. Good Loue, call him backe
4 2017 
4 2018    Othel. Not now (sweet Desdemon) some other time
4 2019 
4 2020    Des. But shall't be shortly?
4 2021   Oth. The sooner (Sweet) for you
4 2022 
4 2023    Des. Shall't be to night, at Supper?
4 2024   Oth. No, not to night
4 2025 
4 2026    Des. To morrow Dinner then?
4 2027   Oth. I shall not dine at home:
4 2028 I meete the Captaines at the Cittadell
4 2029 
4 2030    Des. Why then to morrow night, on Tuesday morne,
4 2031 On Tuesday noone, or night; on Wensday Morne.
4 2032 I prythee name the time, but let it not
4 2033 Exceed three dayes. Infaith hee's penitent:
4 2034 And yet his Trespasse, in our common reason
4 2035 (Saue that they say the warres must make example)
4 2036 Out of her best, is not almost a fault
4 2037 T' encurre a priuate checke. When shall he come?
4 2038 Tell me Othello. I wonder in my Soule
4 2039 What you would aske me, that I should deny,
4 2040 Or stand so mam'ring on? What? Michael Cassio,
4 2041 That came a woing with you? and so many a time
4 2042 (When I haue spoke of you dispraisingly)
4 2043 Hath tane your part, to haue so much to do
4 2044 To bring him in? Trust me, I could do much
4 2045 
4 2046    Oth. Prythee no more: Let him come when he will:
4 2047 I will deny thee nothing
4 2048 
4 2049    Des. Why, this is not a Boone:
4 2050 'Tis as I should entreate you weare your Gloues,
4 2051 Or feede on nourishing dishes, or keepe you warme,
4 2052 Or sue to you, to do a peculiar profit
4 2053 To your owne person. Nay, when I haue a suite
4 2054 Wherein I meane to touch your Loue indeed,
4 2055 It shall be full of poize, and difficult waight,
4 2056 And fearefull to be granted
4 2057 
4 2058    Oth. I will deny thee nothing.
4 2059 Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,
4 2060 To leaue me but a little to my selfe
4 2061 
4 2062    Des. Shall I deny you? No: farewell my Lord
4 2063 
4 2064    Oth. Farewell my Desdemona, Ile come to thee strait
4 2065 
4 2066    Des. aemilia come; be as your Fancies teach you:
4 2067 What ere you be, I am obedient.
4 2068 Enter.
4 2069 
4 2070   Oth. Excellent wretch: Perdition catch my Soule
4 2071 But I do loue thee: and when I loue thee not,
4 2072 Chaos is come againe
4 2073 
4 2074    Iago. My Noble Lord
4 2075 
4 2076    Oth. What dost thou say, Iago?
4 2077   Iago. Did Michael Cassio
4 2078 When he woo'd my Lady, know of your loue?
4 2079   Oth. He did, from first to last:
4 2080 Why dost thou aske?
4 2081   Iago. But for a satisfaction of my Thought,
4 2082 No further harme
4 2083 
4 2084    Oth. Why of thy thought, Iago?
4 2085   Iago. I did not thinke he had bin acquainted with hir
4 2086 
4 2087    Oth. O yes, and went betweene vs very oft
4 2088 
4 2089    Iago. Indeed?
4 2090   Oth. Indeed? I indeed. Discern'st thou ought in that?
4 2091 Is he not honest?
4 2092   Iago. Honest, my Lord?
4 2093   Oth. Honest? I, Honest
4 2094 
4 2095    Iago. My Lord, for ought I know
4 2096 
4 2097    Oth. What do'st thou thinke?
4 2098   Iago. Thinke, my Lord?
4 2099   Oth. Thinke, my Lord? Alas, thou ecchos't me;
4 2100 As if there were some Monster in thy thought
4 2101 Too hideous to be shewne. Thou dost mean somthing:
4 2102 I heard thee say euen now, thou lik'st not that,
4 2103 When Cassio left my wife. What didd'st not like?
4 2104 And when I told thee, he was of my Counsaile,
4 2105 Of my whole course of wooing; thou cried'st, Indeede?
4 2106 And didd'st contract, and purse thy brow together,
4 2107 As if thou then hadd'st shut vp in thy Braine
4 2108 Some horrible Conceite. If thou do'st loue me,
4 2109 Shew me thy thought
4 2110 
4 2111    Iago. My Lord, you know I loue you
4 2112 
4 2113    Oth. I thinke thou do'st:
4 2114 And for I know thou'rt full of Loue, and Honestie,
4 2115 And weigh'st thy words before thou giu'st them breath,
4 2116 Therefore these stops of thine, fright me the more:
4 2117 For such things in a false disloyall Knaue
4 2118 Are trickes of Custome: but in a man that's iust,
4 2119 They're close dilations, working from the heart,
4 2120 That Passion cannot rule
4 2121 
4 2122    Iago. For Michael Cassio,
4 2123 I dare be sworne, I thinke that he is honest
4 2124 
4 2125    Oth. I thinke so too
4 2126 
4 2127    Iago. Men should be what they seeme,
4 2128 Or those that be not, would they might seeme none
4 2129 
4 2130    Oth. Certaine, men should be what they seeme
4 2131 
4 2132    Iago. Why then I thinke Cassio's an honest man
4 2133 
4 2134    Oth. Nay, yet there's more in this?
4 2135 I prythee speake to me, as to thy thinkings,
4 2136 As thou dost ruminate, and giue thy worst of thoughts
4 2137 The worst of words
4 2138 
4 2139    Iago. Good my Lord pardon me,
4 2140 Though I am bound to euery Acte of dutie,
4 2141 I am not bound to that: All Slaues are free:
4 2142 Vtter my Thoughts? Why say, they are vild, and falce?
4 2143 As where's that Palace, whereinto foule things
4 2144 Sometimes intrude not? Who ha's that breast so pure,
4 2145 Wherein vncleanly Apprehensions
4 2146 Keepe Leetes, and Law-dayes, and in Sessions sit
4 2147 With meditations lawfull?
4 2148   Oth. Thou do'st conspire against thy Friend (Iago)
4 2149 If thou but think'st him wrong'd, and mak'st his eare
4 2150 A stranger to thy Thoughts
4 2151 
4 2152    Iago. I do beseech you,
4 2153 Though I perchance am vicious in my guesse
4 2154 (As I confesse it is my Natures plague
4 2155 To spy into Abuses, and of my iealousie
4 2156 Shapes faults that are not) that your wisedome
4 2157 From one, that so imperfectly conceits,
4 2158 Would take no notice, nor build your selfe a trouble
4 2159 Out of his scattering, and vnsure obseruance:
4 2160 It were not for your quiet, nor your good,
4 2161 Nor for my Manhood, Honesty, and Wisedome,
4 2162 To let you know my thoughts
4 2163 
4 2164    Oth. What dost thou meane?
4 2165   Iago. Good name in Man, & woman (deere my Lord)
4 2166 Is the immediate Iewell of their Soules;
4 2167 Who steales my purse, steales trash:
4 2168 'Tis something, nothing;
4 2169 'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has bin slaue to thousands:
4 2170 But he that filches from me my good Name,
4 2171 Robs me of that, which not enriches him,
4 2172 And makes me poore indeed
4 2173 
4 2174    Oth. Ile know thy Thoughts
4 2175 
4 2176    Iago. You cannot, if my heart were in your hand,
4 2177 Nor shall not, whil'st 'tis in my custodie
4 2178 
4 2179    Oth. Ha?
4 2180   Iago. Oh, beware my Lord, of iealousie,
4 2181 It is the greene-ey'd Monster, which doth mocke
4 2182 The meate it feeds on. That Cuckold liues in blisse,
4 2183 Who certaine of his Fate, loues not his wronger:
4 2184 But oh, what damned minutes tels he ore,
4 2185 Who dotes, yet doubts: Suspects, yet soundly loues?
4 2186   Oth. O miserie
4 2187 
4 2188    Iago. Poore, and Content, is rich, and rich enough,
4 2189 But Riches finelesse, is as poore as Winter,
4 2190 To him that euer feares he shall be poore:
4 2191 Good Heauen, the Soules of all my Tribe defend
4 2192 From Iealousie
4 2193 
4 2194    Oth. Why? why is this?
4 2195 Think'st thou, I'ld make a Life of Iealousie;
4 2196 To follow still the changes of the Moone
4 2197 With fresh suspitions? No: to be once in doubt,
4 2198 Is to be resolu'd: Exchange me for a Goat,
4 2199 When I shall turne the businesse of my Soule
4 2200 To such exufflicate, and blow'd Surmises,
4 2201 Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me Iealious,
4 2202 To say my wife is faire, feeds well, loues company,
4 2203 Is free of Speech, Sings, Playes, and Dances:
4 2204 Where Vertue is, these are more vertuous.
4 2205 Nor from mine owne weake merites, will I draw
4 2206 The smallest feare, or doubt of her reuolt,
4 2207 For she had eyes, and chose me. No Iago,
4 2208 Ile see before I doubt; when I doubt, proue;
4 2209 And on the proofe, there is no more but this,
4 2210 Away at once with Loue, or Iealousie
4 2211 
4 2212    Ia. I am glad of this: For now I shall haue reason
4 2213 To shew the Loue and Duty that I beare you
4 2214 With franker spirit. Therefore (as I am bound)
4 2215 Receiue it from me. I speake not yet of proofe:
4 2216 Looke to your wife, obserue her well with Cassio,
4 2217 Weare your eyes, thus: not Iealious, nor Secure:
4 2218 I would not haue your free, and Noble Nature,
4 2219 Out of selfe-Bounty, be abus'd: Looke too't:
4 2220 I know our Country disposition well:
4 2221 In Venice, they do let Heauen see the prankes
4 2222 They dare not shew their Husbands.
4 2223 Their best Conscience,
4 2224 Is not to leaue't vndone, but kept vnknowne
4 2225 
4 2226    Oth. Dost thou say so?
4 2227   Iago. She did deceiue her Father, marrying you,
4 2228 And when she seem'd to shake, and feare your lookes,
4 2229 She lou'd them most
4 2230 
4 2231    Oth. And so she did
4 2232 
4 2233    Iago. Why go too then:
4 2234 Shee that so young could giue out such a Seeming
4 2235 To seele her Fathers eyes vp, close as Oake,
4 2236 He thought 'twas Witchcraft.
4 2237 But I am much too blame:
4 2238 I humbly do beseech you of your pardon
4 2239 For too much louing you
4 2240 
4 2241    Oth. I am bound to thee for euer
4 2242 
4 2243    Iago. I see this hath a little dash'd your Spirits:
4 2244   Oth. Not a iot, not a iot
4 2245 
4 2246    Iago. Trust me, I feare it has:
4 2247 I hope you will consider what is spoke
4 2248 Comes from your Loue.
4 2249 But I do see y'are moou'd:
4 2250 I am to pray you, not to straine my speech
4 2251 To grosser issues, nor to larger reach,
4 2252 Then to Suspition
4 2253 
4 2254    Oth. I will not
4 2255 
4 2256    Iago. Should you do so (my Lord)
4 2257 My speech should fall into such vilde successe,
4 2258 Which my Thoughts aym'd not.
4 2259 Cassio's my worthy Friend:
4 2260 My Lord, I see y'are mou'd
4 2261 
4 2262    Oth. No, not much mou'd:
4 2263 I do not thinke but Desdemona's honest
4 2264 
4 2265    Iago. Long liue she so;
4 2266 And long liue you to thinke so
4 2267 
4 2268    Oth. And yet how Nature erring from it selfe
4 2269 
4 2270    Iago. I, there's the point:
4 2271 As (to be bold with you)
4 2272 Not to affect many proposed Matches
4 2273 Of her owne Clime, Complexion, and Degree,
4 2274 Whereto we see in all things, Nature tends:
4 2275 Foh, one may smel in such, a will most ranke,
4 2276 Foule disproportions, Thoughts vnnaturall.
4 2277 But (pardon me) I do not in position
4 2278 Distinctly speake of her, though I may feare
4 2279 Her will, recoyling to her better iudgement,
4 2280 May fal to match you with her Country formes,
4 2281 And happily repent
4 2282 
4 2283    Oth. Farewell, farewell:
4 2284 If more thou dost perceiue, let me know more:
4 2285 Set on thy wife to obserue.
4 2286 Leaue me Iago
4 2287 
4 2288    Iago. My Lord, I take my leaue
4 2289 
4 2290    Othel. Why did I marry?
4 2291 This honest Creature (doubtlesse)
4 2292 Sees, and knowes more, much more then he vnfolds
4 2293 
4 2294    Iago. My Lord, I would I might intreat your Honor
4 2295 To scan this thing no farther: Leaue it to time,
4 2296 Although 'tis fit that Cassio haue his Place;
4 2297 For sure he filles it vp with great Ability;
4 2298 Yet if you please, to him off a-while:
4 2299 You shall by that perceiue him, and his meanes:
4 2300 Note if your Lady straine his Entertainment
4 2301 With any strong, or vehement importunitie,
4 2302 Much will be seene in that: In the meane time,
4 2303 Let me be thought too busie in my feares,
4 2304 (As worthy cause I haue to feare I am)
4 2305 And hold her free, I do beseech your Honor
4 2306 
4 2307    Oth. Feare not my gouernment
4 2308 
4 2309    Iago. I once more take my leaue.
4 2310 Enter.
4 2311 
4 2312   Oth. This Fellow's of exceeding honesty,
4 2313 And knowes all Quantities with a learn'd Spirit
4 2314 Of humane dealings. If I do proue her Haggard,
4 2315 Though that her Iesses were my deere heart-strings,
4 2316 I'ld whistle her off, and let her downe the winde
4 2317 To prey at Fortune. Haply, for I am blacke,
4 2318 And haue not those soft parts of Conuersation
4 2319 That Chamberers haue: Or for I am declin'd
4 2320 Into the vale of yeares (yet that's not much)
4 2321 Shee's gone. I am abus'd, and my releefe
4 2322 Must be to loath her. Oh Curse of Marriage!
4 2323 That we can call these delicate Creatures ours,
4 2324 And not their Appetites? I had rather be a Toad,
4 2325 And liue vpon the vapour of a Dungeon,
4 2326 Then keepe a corner in the thing I loue
4 2327 For others vses. Yet 'tis the plague to Great-ones,
4 2328 Prerogatiu'd are they lesse then the Base,
4 2329 'Tis destiny vnshunnable, like death:
4 2330 Euen then, this forked plague is Fated to vs,
4 2331 When we do quicken. Looke where she comes:
4 2332 Enter Desdemona and aemilia.
4 2333 
4 2334 If she be false, Heauen mock'd it selfe:
4 2335 Ile not beleeue't
4 2336 
4 2337    Des. How now, my deere Othello?
4 2338 Your dinner, and the generous Islanders
4 2339 By you inuited, do attend your presence
4 2340 
4 2341    Oth. I am too blame
4 2342 
4 2343    Des. Why do you speake so faintly?
4 2344 Are you not well?
4 2345   Oth. I haue a paine vpon my Forehead, heere
4 2346 
4 2347    Des. Why that's with watching, 'twill away againe.
4 2348 Let me but binde it hard, within this houre
4 2349 It will be well
4 2350 
4 2351    Oth. Your Napkin is too little:
4 2352 Let it alone: Come, Ile go in with you.
4 2353 Enter.
4 2354 
4 2355   Des. I am very sorry that you are not well.
4 2356 Aemil. I am glad I haue found this Napkin:
4 2357 This was her first remembrance from the Moore,
4 2358 My wayward Husband hath a hundred times
4 2359 Woo'd me to steale it. But she so loues the Token,
4 2360 (For he coniur'd her, she should euer keepe it)
4 2361 That she reserues it euermore about her,
4 2362 To kisse, and talke too. Ile haue the worke tane out,
4 2363 And giu't Iago: what he will do with it
4 2364 Heauen knowes, not I:
4 2365 I nothing, but to please his Fantasie.
4 2366 Enter Iago.
4 2367 
4 2368   Iago. How now? What do you heere alone?
4 2369 Aemil. Do not you chide: I haue a thing for you
4 2370 
4 2371    Iago. You haue a thing for me?
4 2372 It is a common thing-
4 2373 Aemil. Hah?
4 2374   Iago. To haue a foolish wife.
4 2375 Aemil. Oh, is that all? What will you giue me now
4 2376 For that same Handkerchiefe
4 2377 
4 2378    Iago. What Handkerchiefe?
4 2379 Aemil. What Handkerchiefe?
4 2380 Why that the Moore first gaue to Desdemona,
4 2381 That which so often you did bid me steale
4 2382 
4 2383    Iago. Hast stolne it from her?
4 2384 Aemil. No: but she let it drop by negligence,
4 2385 And to th' aduantage, I being heere, took't vp:
4 2386 Looke, heere 'tis
4 2387 
4 2388    Iago. A good wench, giue it me.
4 2389 Aemil. What will you do with't, that you haue bene
4 2390 so earnest to haue me filch it?
4 2391   Iago. Why, what is that to you?
4 2392 Aemil. If it be not for some purpose of import,
4 2393 Giu't me againe. Poore Lady, shee'l run mad
4 2394 When she shall lacke it
4 2395 
4 2396    Iago. Be not acknowne on't:
4 2397 I haue vse for it. Go, leaue me.
4 2398 
4 2399 Exit aemil.
4 2400 
4 2401 I will in Cassio's Lodging loose this Napkin,
4 2402 And let him finde it. Trifles light as ayre,
4 2403 Are to the iealious, confirmations strong,
4 2404 As proofes of holy Writ. This may do something.
4 2405 The Moore already changes with my poyson:
4 2406 Dangerous conceites, are in their Natures poysons,
4 2407 Which at the first are scarse found to distaste:
4 2408 But with a little acte vpon the blood,
4 2409 Burne like the Mines of Sulphure. I did say so.
4 2410 Enter Othello.
4 2411 
4 2412 Looke where he comes: Not Poppy, nor Mandragora,
4 2413 Nor all the drowsie Syrrups of the world
4 2414 Shall euer medicine thee to that sweete sleepe
4 2415 Which thou owd'st yesterday
4 2416 
4 2417    Oth. Ha, ha, false to mee?
4 2418   Iago. Why how now Generall? No more of that
4 2419 
4 2420    Oth. Auant, be gone: Thou hast set me on the Racke:
4 2421 I sweare 'tis better to be much abus'd,
4 2422 Then but to know't a little
4 2423 
4 2424    Iago. How now, my Lord?
4 2425   Oth. What sense had I, in her stolne houres of Lust?
4 2426 I saw't not, thought it not: it harm'd not me:
4 2427 I slept the next night well, fed well, was free, and merrie.
4 2428 I found not Cassio's kisses on her Lippes:
4 2429 He that is robb'd, not wanting what is stolne,
4 2430 Let him not know't, and he's not robb'd at all
4 2431 
4 2432    Iago. I am sorry to heare this?
4 2433   Oth. I had beene happy, if the generall Campe,
4 2434 Pyoners and all, had tasted her sweet Body,
4 2435 So I had nothing knowne. Oh now, for euer
4 2436 Farewell the Tranquill minde; farewell Content;
4 2437 Farewell the plumed Troopes, and the bigge Warres,
4 2438 That makes Ambition, Vertue! Oh farewell,
4 2439 Farewell the neighing Steed, and the shrill Trumpe,
4 2440 The Spirit-stirring Drum, th' Eare-piercing Fife,
4 2441 The Royall Banner, and all Qualitie,
4 2442 Pride, Pompe, and Circumstance of glorious Warre:
4 2443 And O you mortall Engines, whose rude throates
4 2444 Th' immortall Ioues dread Clamours, counterfet,
4 2445 Farewell: Othello's Occupation's gone
4 2446 
4 2447    Iago. Is't possible my Lord?
4 2448   Oth. Villaine, be sure thou proue my Loue a Whore;
4 2449 Be sure of it: Giue me the Occular proofe,
4 2450 Or by the worth of mine eternall Soule,
4 2451 Thou had'st bin better haue bin borne a Dog
4 2452 Then answer my wak'd wrath
4 2453 
4 2454    Iago. Is't come to this?
4 2455   Oth. Make me to see't: or (at the least) so proue it,
4 2456 That the probation beare no Hindge, nor Loope,
4 2457 To hang a doubt on: Or woe vpon thy life
4 2458 
4 2459    Iago. My Noble Lord
4 2460 
4 2461    Oth. If thou dost slander her, and torture me,
4 2462 Neuer pray more: Abandon all remorse
4 2463 On Horrors head, Horrors accumulate:
4 2464 Do deeds to make Heauen weepe, all Earth amaz'd;
4 2465 For nothing canst thou to damnation adde,
4 2466 Greater then that
4 2467 
4 2468    Iago. O Grace! O Heauen forgiue me!
4 2469 Are you a Man? Haue you a Soule? or Sense?
4 2470 God buy you: take mine Office. Oh wretched Foole,
4 2471 That lou'st to make thine Honesty, a Vice!
4 2472 Oh monstrous world! Take note, take note (O World)
4 2473 To be direct and honest, is not safe.
4 2474 I thanke you for this profit, and from hence
4 2475 Ile loue no Friend, sith Loue breeds such offence
4 2476 
4 2477    Oth. Nay stay: thou should'st be honest
4 2478 
4 2479    Iago. I should be wise; for Honestie's a Foole,
4 2480 And looses that it workes for
4 2481 
4 2482    Oth. By the World,
4 2483 I thinke my Wife be honest, and thinke she is not:
4 2484 I thinke that thou art iust, and thinke thou art not:
4 2485 Ile haue some proofe. My name that was as fresh
4 2486 As Dians Visage, is now begrim'd and blacke
4 2487 As mine owne face. If there be Cords, or Kniues,
4 2488 Poyson, or Fire, or suffocating streames,
4 2489 Ile not indure it. Would I were satisfied
4 2490 
4 2491    Iago. I see you are eaten vp with Passion:
4 2492 I do repent me, that I put it to you.
4 2493 You would be satisfied?
4 2494   Oth. Would? Nay, and I will
4 2495 
4 2496    Iago. And may: but how? How satisfied, my Lord?
4 2497 Would you the super-vision grossely gape on?
4 2498 Behold her top'd?
4 2499   Oth. Death, and damnation. Oh!
4 2500   Iago. It were a tedious difficulty, I thinke,
4 2501 To bring them to that Prospect: Damne them then,
4 2502 If euer mortall eyes do see them boulster
4 2503 More then their owne. What then? How then?
4 2504 What shall I say? Where's Satisfaction?
4 2505 It is impossible you should see this,
4 2506 Were they as prime as Goates, as hot as Monkeyes,
4 2507 As salt as Wolues in pride, and Fooles as grosse
4 2508 As Ignorance, made drunke. But yet, I say,
4 2509 If imputation, and strong circumstances,
4 2510 Which leade directly to the doore of Truth,
4 2511 Will giue you satisfaction, you might haue't
4 2512 
4 2513    Oth. Giue me a liuing reason she's disloyall
4 2514 
4 2515    Iago. I do not like the Office.
4 2516 But sith I am entred in this cause so farre
4 2517 (Prick'd too't by foolish Honesty, and Loue)
4 2518 I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately,
4 2519 And being troubled with a raging tooth,
4 2520 I could not sleepe. There are a kinde of men,
4 2521 So loose of Soule, that in their sleepes will mutter
4 2522 Their Affayres: one of this kinde is Cassio:
4 2523 In sleepe I heard him say, sweet Desdemona,
4 2524 Let vs be wary, let vs hide our Loues,
4 2525 And then (Sir) would he gripe, and wring my hand:
4 2526 Cry, oh sweet Creature: then kisse me hard,
4 2527 As if he pluckt vp kisses by the rootes,
4 2528 That grew vpon my lippes, laid his Leg ore my Thigh,
4 2529 And sigh, and kisse, and then cry cursed Fate,
4 2530 That gaue thee to the Moore
4 2531 
4 2532    Oth. O monstrous! monstrous!
4 2533   Iago. Nay, this was but his Dreame
4 2534 
4 2535    Oth. But this denoted a fore-gone conclusion,
4 2536 'Tis a shrew'd doubt, though it be but a Dreame
4 2537 
4 2538    Iago. And this may helpe to thicken other proofes,
4 2539 That do demonstrate thinly
4 2540 
4 2541    Oth. Ile teare her all to peeces
4 2542 
4 2543    Iago. Nay yet be wise; yet we see nothing done,
4 2544 She may be honest yet: Tell me but this,
4 2545 Haue you not sometimes seene a Handkerchiefe
4 2546 Spotted with Strawberries, in your wiues hand?
4 2547   Oth. I gaue her such a one: 'twas my first gift
4 2548 
4 2549    Iago. I know not that: but such a Handkerchiefe
4 2550 (I am sure it was your wiues) did I to day
4 2551 See Cassio wipe his Beard with
4 2552 
4 2553    Oth. If it be that
4 2554 
4 2555    Iago. If it be that, or any, it was here.
4 2556 It speakes against her with the other proofes
4 2557 
4 2558    Othel. O that the Slaue had forty thousand liues:
4 2559 One is too poore, too weake for my reuenge.
4 2560 Now do I see 'tis true. Looke heere Iago,
4 2561 All my fond loue thus do I blow to Heauen. 'Tis gone.
4 2562 Arise blacke vengeance, from the hollow hell,
4 2563 Yeeld vp (O Loue) thy Crowne, and hearted Throne
4 2564 To tyrannous Hate. Swell bosome with thy fraught,
4 2565 For 'tis of Aspickes tongues
4 2566 
4 2567    Iago. Yet be content
4 2568 
4 2569    Oth. Oh blood, blood, blood
4 2570 
4 2571    Iago. Patience I say: your minde may change
4 2572 
4 2573    Oth. Neuer Iago. Like to the Ponticke Sea,
4 2574 Whose Icie Current, and compulsiue course,
4 2575 Neu'r keepes retyring ebbe, but keepes due on
4 2576 To the Proponticke, and the Hellespont:
4 2577 Euen so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace
4 2578 Shall neu'r looke backe, neu'r ebbe to humble Loue,
4 2579 Till that a capeable, and wide Reuenge
4 2580 Swallow them vp. Now by yond Marble Heauen,
4 2581 In the due reuerence of a Sacred vow,
4 2582 I heere engage my words
4 2583 
4 2584    Iago. Do not rise yet:
4 2585 Witnesse you euer-burning Lights aboue,
4 2586 You Elements, that clip vs round about,
4 2587 Witnesse that heere Iago doth giue vp
4 2588 The execution of his wit, hands, heart,
4 2589 To wrong'd Othello's Seruice. Let him command,
4 2590 And to obey shall be in me remorse,
4 2591 What bloody businesse euer
4 2592 
4 2593    Oth. I greet thy loue,
4 2594 Not with vaine thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,
4 2595 And will vpon the instant put thee too't.
4 2596 Within these three dayes let me heare thee say,
4 2597 That Cassio's not aliue
4 2598 
4 2599    Iago. My Friend is dead:
4 2600 'Tis done at your Request.
4 2601 But let her liue
4 2602 
4 2603    Oth. Damne her lewde Minx:
4 2604 O damne her, damne her.
4 2605 Come go with me a-part, I will withdraw
4 2606 To furnish me with some swift meanes of death
4 2607 For the faire Diuell.
4 2608 Now art thou my Lieutenant
4 2609 
4 2610    Iago. I am your owne for euer.
4 2611 
4 2612 Exeunt.
4 2613 
4 2614 
4 2615 Scaena Quarta.
4 2616 
4 2617 Enter Desdemona, aemilia, and Clown.
4 2618 
4 2619   Des. Do you know Sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio
4 2620 lyes?
4 2621   Clow. I dare not say he lies any where
4 2622 
4 2623    Des. Why man?
4 2624   Clo. He's a Soldier, and for me to say a Souldier lyes,
4 2625 'tis stabbing
4 2626 
4 2627    Des. Go too: where lodges he?
4 2628   Clo. To tell you where he lodges, is to tel you where
4 2629 I lye
4 2630 
4 2631    Des. Can any thing be made of this?
4 2632   Clo. I know not where he lodges, and for mee to deuise
4 2633 a lodging, and say he lies heere, or he lies there, were
4 2634 to lye in mine owne throat
4 2635 
4 2636    Des. Can you enquire him out? and be edified by report?
4 2637   Clo. I will Catechize the world for him, that is, make
4 2638 Questions, and by them answer
4 2639 
4 2640    Des. Seeke him, bidde him come hither: tell him, I
4 2641 haue moou'd my Lord on his behalfe, and hope all will
4 2642 be well
4 2643 
4 2644    Clo. To do this, is within the compasse of mans Wit,
4 2645 and therefore I will attempt the doing it.
4 2646 
4 2647 Exit Clo.
4 2648 
4 2649   Des. Where should I loose the Handkerchiefe, aemilia?
4 2650 Aemil. I know not Madam
4 2651 
4 2652    Des. Beleeue me, I had rather haue lost my purse
4 2653 Full of Cruzadoes. And but my Noble Moore
4 2654 Is true of minde, and made of no such basenesse,
4 2655 As iealious Creatures are, it were enough
4 2656 To put him to ill-thinking.
4 2657 Aemil. Is he not iealious?
4 2658   Des. Who, he? I thinke the Sun where he was borne,
4 2659 Drew all such humors from him.
4 2660 Aemil. Looke where he comes.
4 2661 Enter Othello.
4 2662 
4 2663   Des. I will not leaue him now, till Cassio be
4 2664 Call'd to him. How is't with you, my Lord?
4 2665   Oth. Well my good Lady. Oh hardnes to dissemble!
4 2666 How do you, Desdemona?
4 2667   Des. Well, my good Lord
4 2668 
4 2669    Oth. Giue me your hand.
4 2670 This hand is moist, my Lady
4 2671 
4 2672    Des. It hath felt no age, nor knowne no sorrow
4 2673 
4 2674    Oth. This argues fruitfulnesse, and liberall heart:
4 2675 Hot, hot, and moyst. This hand of yours requires
4 2676 A sequester from Liberty: Fasting, and Prayer,
4 2677 Much Castigation, Exercise deuout,
4 2678 For heere's a yong, and sweating Diuell heere
4 2679 That commonly rebels: 'Tis a good hand,
4 2680 A franke one
4 2681 
4 2682    Des. You may (indeed) say so:
4 2683 For 'twas that hand that gaue away my heart
4 2684 
4 2685    Oth. A liberall hand. The hearts of old, gaue hands:
4 2686 But our new Heraldry is hands, not hearts
4 2687 
4 2688    Des. I cannot speake of this:
4 2689 Come, now your promise
4 2690 
4 2691    Oth. What promise, Chucke?
4 2692   Des. I haue sent to bid Cassio come speake with you
4 2693 
4 2694    Oth. I haue a salt and sorry Rhewme offends me:
4 2695 Lend me thy Handkerchiefe
4 2696 
4 2697    Des. Heere my Lord
4 2698 
4 2699    Oth. That which I gaue you
4 2700 
4 2701    Des. I haue it not about me
4 2702 
4 2703    Oth. Not?
4 2704   Des. No indeed, my Lord
4 2705 
4 2706    Oth. That's a fault: That Handkerchiefe
4 2707 Did an aegyptian to my Mother giue:
4 2708 She was a Charmer, and could almost read
4 2709 The thoughts of people. She told her, while she kept it,
4 2710 'T would make her Amiable, and subdue my Father
4 2711 Intirely to her loue: But if she lost it,
4 2712 Or made a Guift of it, my Fathers eye
4 2713 Should hold her loathed, and his Spirits should hunt
4 2714 After new Fancies. She dying, gaue it me,
4 2715 And bid me (when my Fate would haue me Wiu'd)
4 2716 To giue it her. I did so; and take heede on't,
4 2717 Make it a Darling, like your precious eye:
4 2718 To loose't, or giue't away, were such perdition,
4 2719 As nothing else could match
4 2720 
4 2721    Des. Is't possible?
4 2722   Oth. 'Tis true: There's Magicke in the web of it:
4 2723 A Sybill that had numbred in the world
4 2724 The Sun to course, two hundred compasses,
4 2725 In her Prophetticke furie sow'd the Worke:
4 2726 The Wormes were hallowed, that did breede the Silke,
4 2727 And it was dyde in Mummey, which the Skilfull
4 2728 Conseru'd of Maidens hearts
4 2729 
4 2730    Des. Indeed? Is't true?
4 2731   Oth. Most veritable, therefore looke too't well
4 2732 
4 2733    Des. Then would to Heauen, that I had neuer seene't?
4 2734   Oth. Ha? wherefore?
4 2735   Des. Why do you speake so startingly, and rash?
4 2736   Oth. Is't lost? Is't gon? Speak, is't out o'th' way?
4 2737   Des. Blesse vs
4 2738 
4 2739    Oth. Say you?
4 2740   Des. It is not lost: but what and if it were?
4 2741   Oth. How?
4 2742   Des. I say it is not lost
4 2743 
4 2744    Oth. Fetcht, let me see't
4 2745 
4 2746    Des. Why so I can: but I will not now:
4 2747 This is a tricke to put me from my suite,
4 2748 Pray you let Cassio be receiu'd againe
4 2749 
4 2750    Oth. Fetch me the Handkerchiefe,
4 2751 My minde mis-giues
4 2752 
4 2753    Des. Come, come: you'l neuer meete a more sufficient
4 2754 man
4 2755 
4 2756    Oth. The Handkerchiefe
4 2757 
4 2758    Des. A man that all his time
4 2759 Hath founded his good Fortunes on your loue;
4 2760 Shar'd dangers with you
4 2761 
4 2762    Oth. The Handkerchiefe
4 2763 
4 2764    Des. Insooth, you are too blame
4 2765 
4 2766    Oth. Away.
4 2767 
4 2768 Exit Othello.
4 2769 
4 2770 Aemil. Is not this man iealious?
4 2771   Des. I neu'r saw this before.
4 2772 Sure, there's some wonder in this Handkerchiefe,
4 2773 I am most vnhappy in the losse of it.
4 2774 Aemil. 'Tis not a yeare or two shewes vs a man:
4 2775 They are all but Stomackes, and we all but Food,
4 2776 They eate vs hungerly, and when they are full
4 2777 They belch vs.
4 2778 Enter Iago, and Cassio.
4 2779 
4 2780 Looke you, Cassio and my Husband
4 2781 
4 2782    Iago. There is no other way: 'tis she must doo't:
4 2783 And loe the happinesse: go, and importune her
4 2784 
4 2785    Des. How now (good Cassio) what's the newes with
4 2786 you?
4 2787   Cassio. Madam, my former suite. I do beseech you,
4 2788 That by your vertuous meanes, I may againe
4 2789 Exist, and be a member of his loue,
4 2790 Whom I, with all the Office of my heart
4 2791 Intirely honour, I would not be delayd.
4 2792 If my offence, be of such mortall kinde,
4 2793 That nor my Seruice past, nor present Sorrowes,
4 2794 Nor purpos'd merit in futurity,
4 2795 Can ransome me into his loue againe,
4 2796 But to know so, must be my benefit:
4 2797 So shall I cloath me in a forc'd content,
4 2798 And shut my selfe vp in some other course
4 2799 To Fortunes Almes
4 2800 
4 2801    Des. Alas (thrice-gentle Cassio)
4 2802 My Aduocation is not now in Tune;
4 2803 My Lord, is not my Lord; nor should I know him,
4 2804 Were he in Fauour, as in Humour alter'd.
4 2805 So helpe me euery spirit sanctified,
4 2806 As I haue spoken for you all my best,
4 2807 And stood within the blanke of his displeasure
4 2808 For my free speech. You must awhile be patient:
4 2809 What I can do, I will: and more I will
4 2810 Then for my selfe, I dare. Let that suffice you
4 2811 
4 2812    Iago. Is my Lord angry?
4 2813 Aemil. He went hence but now:
4 2814 And certainly in strange vnquietnesse
4 2815 
4 2816    Iago. Can he be angry? I haue seen the Cannon
4 2817 When it hath blowne his Rankes into the Ayre,
4 2818 And like the Diuell from his very Arme
4 2819 Puff't his owne Brother: And is he angry?
4 2820 Something of moment then: I will go meet him,
4 2821 There's matter in't indeed, if he be angry.
4 2822 
4 2823 Exit
4 2824 
4 2825   Des. I prythee do so. Something sure of State,
4 2826 Either from Venice, or some vnhatch'd practise
4 2827 Made demonstrable heere in Cyprus, to him,
4 2828 Hath pudled his cleare Spirit: and in such cases,
4 2829 Mens Natures wrangle with inferiour things,
4 2830 Though great ones are their obiect. 'Tis euen so.
4 2831 For let our finger ake, and it endues
4 2832 Our other healthfull members, euen to a sense
4 2833 Of paine. Nay, we must thinke men are not Gods,
4 2834 Nor of them looke for such obseruancie
4 2835 As fits the Bridall. Beshrew me much, aemilia,
4 2836 I was (vnhandsome Warrior, as I am)
4 2837 Arraigning his vnkindnesse with my soule:
4 2838 But now I finde, I had suborn'd the Witnesse,
4 2839 And he's Indited falsely.
4 2840 Aemil. Pray heauen it bee
4 2841 State matters, as you thinke, and no Conception,
4 2842 Nor no Iealious Toy, concerning you
4 2843 
4 2844    Des. Alas the day, I neuer gaue him cause.
4 2845 Aemil. But Iealious soules will not be answer'd so;
4 2846 They are not euer iealious for the cause,
4 2847 But iealious, for they're iealious. It is a Monster
4 2848 Begot vpon it selfe, borne on it selfe
4 2849 
4 2850    Des. Heauen keepe the Monster from Othello's mind.
4 2851 Aemil. Lady, Amen
4 2852 
4 2853    Des. I will go seeke him. Cassio, walke heere about:
4 2854 If I doe finde him fit, Ile moue your suite,
4 2855 And seeke to effect it to my vttermost.
4 2856 
4 2857 Exit
4 2858 
4 2859   Cas. I humbly thanke your Ladyship.
4 2860 Enter Bianca.
4 2861 
4 2862   Bian. 'Saue you (Friend Cassio.)
4 2863   Cassio. What make you from home?
4 2864 How is't with you, my most faire Bianca?
4 2865 Indeed (sweet Loue) I was comming to your house
4 2866 
4 2867    Bian. And I was going to your Lodging, Cassio.
4 2868 What? keepe a weeke away? Seuen dayes, and Nights?
4 2869 Eight score eight houres? And Louers absent howres
4 2870 More tedious then the Diall, eight score times?
4 2871 Oh weary reck'ning
4 2872 
4 2873    Cassio. Pardon me, Bianca:
4 2874 I haue this while with leaden thoughts beene prest,
4 2875 But I shall in a more continuate time
4 2876 Strike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca
4 2877 Take me this worke out
4 2878 
4 2879    Bianca. Oh Cassio, whence came this?
4 2880 This is some Token from a newer Friend,
4 2881 To the felt-Absence: now I feele a Cause:
4 2882 Is't come to this? Well, well
4 2883 
4 2884    Cassio. Go too, woman:
4 2885 Throw your vilde gesses in the Diuels teeth,
4 2886 From whence you haue them. You are iealious now,
4 2887 That this is from some Mistris, some remembrance;
4 2888 No, in good troth Bianca
4 2889 
4 2890    Bian. Why, who's is it?
4 2891   Cassio. I know not neither:
4 2892 I found it in my Chamber,
4 2893 I like the worke well; Ere it be demanded
4 2894 (As like enough it will) I would haue it coppied:
4 2895 Take it, and doo't, and leaue me for this time
4 2896 
4 2897    Bian. Leaue you? Wherefore?
4 2898   Cassio. I do attend heere on the Generall,
4 2899 And thinke it no addition, nor my wish
4 2900 To haue him see me woman'd
4 2901 
4 2902    Bian. Why, I pray you?
4 2903   Cassio. Not that I loue you not
4 2904 
4 2905    Bian. But that you do not loue me.
4 2906 I pray you bring me on the way a little,
4 2907 And say, if I shall see you soone at night?
4 2908   Cassio. 'Tis but a little way that I can bring you,
4 2909 For I attend heere: But Ile see you soone
4 2910 
4 2911    Bian. 'Tis very good: I must be circumstanc'd.
4 2912 
4 2913 Exeunt. omnes.
4 2914 
4 2915 
4 2916 Actus Quartus. Scena Prima.
4 2917 
4 2918 Enter Othello, and Iago.
4 2919 
4 2920   Iago. Will you thinke so?
4 2921   Oth. Thinke so, Iago?
4 2922   Iago. What, to kisse in priuate?
4 2923   Oth. An vnauthoriz'd kisse?
4 2924   Iago. Or to be naked with her Friend in bed,
4 2925 An houre, or more, not meaning any harme?
4 2926   Oth. Naked in bed (Iago) and not meane harme?
4 2927 It is hypocrisie against the Diuell:
4 2928 They that meane vertuously, and yet do so,
4 2929 The Diuell their vertue tempts, and they tempt Heauen
4 2930 
4 2931    Iago. If they do nothing, 'tis a Veniall slip:
4 2932 But if I giue my wife a Handkerchiefe
4 2933 
4 2934    Oth. What then?
4 2935   Iago. Why then 'tis hers (my Lord) and being hers,
4 2936 She may (I thinke) bestow't on any man
4 2937 
4 2938    Oth. She is Protectresse of her honor too:
4 2939 May she giue that?
4 2940   Iago. Her honor is an Essence that's not seene,
4 2941 They haue it very oft, that haue it not.
4 2942 But for the Handkerchiefe
4 2943 
4 2944    Othe. By heauen, I would most gladly haue forgot it:
4 2945 Thou saidst (oh, it comes ore my memorie,
4 2946 As doth the Rauen o're the infectious house:
4 2947 Boading to all) he had my Handkerchiefe
4 2948 
4 2949    Iago . I: what of that?
4 2950   Othe. That's not so good now
4 2951 
4 2952    Iag. What if I had said, I had seene him do you wrong?
4 2953 Or heard him say (as Knaues be such abroad,
4 2954 Who hauing by their owne importunate suit,
4 2955 Or voluntary dotage of some Mistris,
4 2956 Conuinced or supply'd them, cannot chuse
4 2957 But they must blab.)
4 2958   Oth. Hath he said any thing?
4 2959   Iago. He hath (my Lord) but be you well assur'd,
4 2960 No more then he'le vn-sweare
4 2961 
4 2962    Oth. What hath he said?
4 2963   Iago. Why, that he did: I know not what he did
4 2964 
4 2965    Othe. What? What?
4 2966   Iago. Lye
4 2967 
4 2968    Oth. With her?
4 2969   Iago. With her? On her: what you will
4 2970 
4 2971    Othe. Lye with her? lye on her? We say lye on her,
4 2972 when they be-lye-her. Lye with her: that's fullsome:
4 2973 Handkerchiefe: Confessions: Handkerchiefe. To confesse,
4 2974 and be hang'd for his labour. First, to be hang'd,
4 2975 and then to confesse: I tremble at it. Nature would not
4 2976 inuest her selfe in such shadowing passion, without some
4 2977 Instruction. It is not words that shakes me thus, (pish)
4 2978 Noses, Eares, and Lippes: is't possible. Confesse? Handkerchiefe?
4 2979 O diuell.
4 2980 
4 2981 Falls in a Traunce.
4 2982 
4 2983   Iago. Worke on,
4 2984 My Medicine workes. Thus credulous Fooles are caught,
4 2985 And many worthy, and chast Dames euen thus,
4 2986 (All guiltlesse) meete reproach: what hoa? My Lord?
4 2987 My Lord, I say: Othello.
4 2988 Enter Cassio.
4 2989 
4 2990 How now Cassio?
4 2991   Cas. What's the matter?
4 2992   Iago. My Lord is falne into an Epilepsie,
4 2993 This is his second Fit: he had one yesterday
4 2994 
4 2995    Cas. Rub him about the Temples
4 2996 
4 2997    Iago. The Lethargie must haue his quyet course:
4 2998 If not, he foames at mouth: and by and by
4 2999 Breakes out to sauage madnesse. Looke, he stirres:
4 3000 Do you withdraw your selfe a little while,
4 3001 He will recouer straight: when he is gone,
4 3002 I would on great occasion, speake with you.
4 3003 How is it Generall? Haue you not hurt your head?
4 3004   Othe. Dost thou mocke me?
4 3005   Iago. I mocke you not, by Heauen:
4 3006 Would you would beare your Fortune like a Man
4 3007 
4 3008    Othe. A Horned man's a Monster, and a Beast
4 3009 
4 3010    Iago. Ther's many a Beast then in a populous Citty,
4 3011 And many a ciuill Monster
4 3012 
4 3013    Othe. Did he confesse it?
4 3014   Iago. Good Sir, be a man:
4 3015 Thinke euery bearded fellow that's but yoak'd
4 3016 May draw with you. There's Millions now aliue,
4 3017 That nightly lye in those vnproper beds,
4 3018 Which they dare sweare peculiar. Your case is better.
4 3019 Oh, 'tis the spight of hell, the Fiends Arch-mock,
4 3020 To lip a wanton in a secure Cowch;
4 3021 And to suppose her chast. No, let me know,
4 3022 And knowing what I am, I know what she shallbe
4 3023 
4 3024    Oth. Oh, thou art wise: 'tis certaine
4 3025 
4 3026    Iago. Stand you a while apart,
4 3027 Confine your selfe but in a patient List,
4 3028 Whil'st you were heere, o're-whelmed with your griefe
4 3029 (A passion most resulting such a man)
4 3030 Cassio came hither: I shifted him away,
4 3031 And layd good scuses vpon your Extasie,
4 3032 Bad him anon returne: and heere speake with me,
4 3033 The which he promis'd. Do but encaue your selfe,
4 3034 And marke the Fleeres, the Gybes, and notable Scornes
4 3035 That dwell in euery Region of his face.
4 3036 For I will make him tell the Tale anew;
4 3037 Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when
4 3038 He hath, and is againe to cope your wife.
4 3039 I say, but marke his gesture: marry Patience,
4 3040 Or I shall say y'are all in all in Spleene,
4 3041 And nothing of a man
4 3042 
4 3043    Othe. Do'st thou heare, Iago,
4 3044 I will be found most cunning in my Patience:
4 3045 But (do'st thou heare) most bloody
4 3046 
4 3047    Iago. That's not amisse,
4 3048 But yet keepe time in all: will you withdraw?
4 3049 Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,
4 3050 A Huswife that by selling her desires
4 3051 Buyes her selfe Bread, and Cloath. It is a Creature
4 3052 That dotes on Cassio, (as 'tis the Strumpets plague
4 3053 To be-guile many, and be be-guil'd by one)
4 3054 He, when he heares of her, cannot restraine
4 3055 From the excesse of Laughter. Heere he comes.
4 3056 Enter Cassio.
4 3057 
4 3058 As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad:
4 3059 And his vnbookish Ielousie must conserue
4 3060 Poore Cassio's smiles, gestures, and light behauiours
4 3061 Quite in the wrong. How do you Lieutenant?
4 3062   Cas. The worser, that you giue me the addition,
4 3063 Whose want euen killes me
4 3064 
4 3065    Iago. Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on't:
4 3066 Now, if this Suit lay in Bianca's dowre,
4 3067 How quickely should you speed?
4 3068   Cas. Alas poore Caitiffe
4 3069 
4 3070    Oth. Looke how he laughes already
4 3071 
4 3072    Iago. I neuer knew woman loue man so
4 3073 
4 3074    Cas. Alas poore Rogue, I thinke indeed she loues me
4 3075 
4 3076    Oth. Now he denies it faintly: and laughes it out
4 3077 
4 3078    Iago. Do you heare Cassio?
4 3079   Oth. Now he importunes him
4 3080 To tell it o're: go too, well said, well said
4 3081 
4 3082    Iago. She giues it out, that you shall marry her.
4 3083 Do you intend it?
4 3084   Cas. Ha, ha, ha
4 3085 
4 3086    Oth. Do ye triumph, Romaine? do you triumph?
4 3087   Cas. I marry. What? A customer; prythee beare
4 3088 Some Charitie to my wit, do not thinke it
4 3089 So vnwholesome. Ha, ha, ha
4 3090 
4 3091    Oth. So, so, so, so: they laugh, that winnes
4 3092 
4 3093    Iago. Why the cry goes, that you marry her
4 3094 
4 3095    Cas. Prythee say true
4 3096 
4 3097    Iago. I am a very Villaine else
4 3098 
4 3099    Oth. Haue you scoar'd me? Well
4 3100 
4 3101    Cas. This is the Monkeys owne giuing out:
4 3102 She is perswaded I will marry her
4 3103 Out of her owne loue & flattery, not out of my promise
4 3104 
4 3105    Oth. Iago becomes me: now he begins the story
4 3106 
4 3107    Cassio. She was heere euen now: she haunts me in euery
4 3108 place. I was the other day talking on the Seabanke
4 3109 with certaine Venetians, and thither comes the
4 3110 Bauble, and falls me thus about my neck
4 3111 
4 3112    Oth. Crying oh deere Cassio, as it were: his iesture imports
4 3113 it
4 3114 
4 3115    Cassio. So hangs, and lolls, and weepes vpon me:
4 3116 So shakes, and pulls me. Ha, ha, ha
4 3117 
4 3118    Oth. Now he tells how she pluckt him to my Chamber:
4 3119 oh, I see that nose of yours, but not that dogge, I
4 3120 shall throw it to
4 3121 
4 3122    Cassio. Well, I must leaue her companie
4 3123 
4 3124    Iago. Before me: looke where she comes.
4 3125 Enter Bianca.
4 3126 
4 3127   Cas. 'Tis such another Fitchew: marry a perfum'd one?
4 3128 What do you meane by this haunting of me?
4 3129   Bian. Let the diuell, and his dam haunt you: what
4 3130 did you meane by that same Handkerchiefe, you gaue
4 3131 me euen now? I was a fine Foole to take it: I must take
4 3132 out the worke? A likely piece of worke, that you should
4 3133 finde it in your Chamber, and know not who left it there.
4 3134 This is some Minxes token, & I must take out the worke?
4 3135 There, giue it your Hobbey-horse, wheresoeuer you had
4 3136 it, Ile take out no worke on't
4 3137 
4 3138    Cassio. How now, my sweete Bianca?
4 3139 How now? How now?
4 3140   Othe. By Heauen, that should be my Handkerchiefe
4 3141 
4 3142    Bian. If you'le come to supper to night you may, if
4 3143 you will not come when you are next prepar'd for.
4 3144 
4 3145 Exit
4 3146 
4 3147   Iago. After her: after her
4 3148 
4 3149    Cas. I must, shee'l rayle in the streets else
4 3150 
4 3151    Iago. Will you sup there?
4 3152   Cassio. Yes, I intend so
4 3153 
4 3154    Iago. Well, I may chance to see you: for I would very
4 3155 faine speake with you
4 3156 
4 3157    Cas. Prythee come: will you?
4 3158   Iago. Go too; say no more
4 3159 
4 3160    Oth. How shall I murther him, Iago
4 3161 
4 3162    Iago. Did you perceiue how he laugh'd at his vice?
4 3163   Oth. Oh, Iago
4 3164 
4 3165    Iago. And did you see the Handkerchiefe?
4 3166   Oth. Was that mine?
4 3167   Iago. Yours by this hand: and to see how he prizes
4 3168 the foolish woman your wife: she gaue it him and, he
4 3169 hath giu'n it his whore
4 3170 
4 3171    Oth. I would haue him nine yeeres a killing:
4 3172 A fine woman, a faire woman, a sweete woman?
4 3173   Iago. Nay, you must forget that
4 3174 
4 3175    Othello. I, let her rot and perish, and be damn'd to
4 3176 night, for she shall not liue. No, my heart is turn'd to
4 3177 stone: I strike it, and it hurts my hand. Oh, the world
4 3178 hath not a sweeter Creature: she might lye by an Emperours
4 3179 side, and command him Taskes
4 3180 
4 3181    Iago. Nay, that's not your way
4 3182 
4 3183    Othe. Hang her, I do but say what she is: so delicate
4 3184 with her Needle: an admirable Musitian. Oh she will
4 3185 sing the Sauagenesse out of a Beare: of so high and plenteous
4 3186 wit, and inuention?
4 3187   Iago. She's the worse for all this
4 3188 
4 3189    Othe. Oh, a thousand, a thousand times:
4 3190 And then of so gentle a condition?
4 3191   Iago. I too gentle
4 3192 
4 3193    Othe. Nay that's certaine:
4 3194 But yet the pitty of it, Iago: oh Iago, the pitty of it
4 3195 Iago
4 3196 
4 3197    Iago. If you are so fond ouer her iniquitie: giue her
4 3198 pattent to offend, for if it touch not you, it comes neere
4 3199 no body
4 3200 
4 3201    Oth. I will chop her into Messes: Cuckold me?
4 3202   Iago. Oh, 'tis foule in her
4 3203 
4 3204    Oth. With mine Officer?
4 3205   Iago. That's fouler
4 3206 
4 3207    Othe. Get me some poyson, Iago, this night. Ile not
4 3208 expostulate with her: least her body and beautie vnprouide
4 3209 my mind againe: this night Iago
4 3210 
4 3211    Iago. Do it not with poyson, strangle her in her bed,
4 3212 Euen the bed she hath contaminated
4 3213 
4 3214    Oth. Good, good:
4 3215 The Iustice of it pleases: very good
4 3216 
4 3217    Iago. And for Cassio, let me be his vndertaker:
4 3218 You shall heare more by midnight.
4 3219 Enter Lodouico, Desdemona, and Attendants.
4 3220 
4 3221   Othe. Excellent good: What Trumpet is that same?
4 3222   Iago. I warrant something from Venice,
4 3223 'Tis Lodouico, this, comes from the Duke.
4 3224 See, your wife's with him
4 3225 
4 3226    Lodo. Saue you worthy Generall
4 3227 
4 3228    Othe. With all my heart Sir
4 3229 
4 3230    Lod. The Duke, and the Senators of Venice greet you
4 3231 
4 3232    Othe. I kisse the Instrument of their pleasures
4 3233 
4 3234    Des. And what's the newes, good cozen Lodouico
4 3235   Iago. I am very glad to see you Signior:
4 3236 Welcome to Cyprus
4 3237 
4 3238    Lod. I thanke you: how do's Lieutenant Cassio?
4 3239   Iago. Liues Sir,
4 3240   Des. Cozen, there's falne betweene him, & my Lord,
4 3241 An vnkind breach: but you shall make all well
4 3242 
4 3243    Othe. Are you sure of that?
4 3244   Des. My Lord?
4 3245   Othe. This faile you not to do, as you will-
4 3246   Lod. He did not call: he's busie in the paper,
4 3247 Is there deuision 'twixt my Lord, and Cassio?
4 3248   Des. A most vnhappy one: I would do much
4 3249 T' attone, them, for the loue I beare to Cassio
4 3250 
4 3251    Oth. Fire, and brimestone
4 3252 
4 3253    Des. My Lord
4 3254 
4 3255    Oth. Are you wise?
4 3256   Des. What is he angrie?
4 3257   Lod. May be the Letter mou'd him.
4 3258 For as I thinke, they do command him home,
4 3259 Deputing Cassio in his Gouernment
4 3260 
4 3261    Des. Trust me, I am glad on't
4 3262 
4 3263    Othe. Indeed?
4 3264   Des. My Lord?
4 3265   Othe. I am glad to see you mad
4 3266 
4 3267    Des. Why, sweete Othello?
4 3268   Othe. Diuell
4 3269 
4 3270    Des. I haue not deseru'd this
4 3271 
4 3272    Lod. My Lord, this would not be beleeu'd in Venice,
4 3273 Though I should sweare I saw't. 'Tis very much,
4 3274 Make her amends: she weepes
4 3275 
4 3276    Othe. Oh diuell, diuell:
4 3277 If that the Earth could teeme with womans teares,
4 3278 Each drop she falls, would proue a Crocodile:
4 3279 Out of my sight
4 3280 
4 3281    Des. I will not stay to offend you
4 3282 
4 3283    Lod. Truely obedient Lady:
4 3284 I do beseech your Lordship call her backe
4 3285 
4 3286    Othe. Mistris
4 3287 
4 3288    Des. My Lord
4 3289 
4 3290    Othe. What would you with her, Sir?
4 3291   Lod. Who I, my Lord?
4 3292   Othe. I, you did wish, that I would make her turne:
4 3293 Sir, she can turne, and turne: and yet go on
4 3294 And turne againe. And she can weepe, Sir, weepe.
4 3295 And she's obedient: as you say obedient.
4 3296 Very obedient: proceed you in your teares.
4 3297 Concerning this Sir, (oh well-painted passion)
4 3298 I am commanded home: get you away:
4 3299 Ile send for you anon. Sir I obey the Mandate,
4 3300 And will returne to Venice. Hence, auaunt:
4 3301 Cassio shall haue my Place. And Sir, to night
4 3302 I do entreat, that we may sup together.
4 3303 You are welcome Sir to Cyprus.
4 3304 Goates, and Monkeys.
4 3305 Enter.
4 3306 
4 3307   Lod. Is this the Noble Moore, whom our full Senate
4 3308 Call all in all sufficient? Is this the Nature
4 3309 Whom Passion could not shake? Whose solid vertue
4 3310 The shot of Accident, nor dart of Chance
4 3311 Could neither graze, nor pierce?
4 3312   Iago. He is much chang'd
4 3313 
4 3314    Lod. Are his wits safe? Is he not light of Braine?
4 3315   Iago. He's that he is: I may not breath my censure.
4 3316 What he might be: if what he might, he is not,
4 3317 I would to heauen he were
4 3318 
4 3319    Lod. What? Strike his wife?
4 3320   Iago. 'Faith that was not so well: yet would I knew
4 3321 That stroke would proue the worst
4 3322 
4 3323    Lod. Is it his vse?
4 3324 Or did the Letters, worke vpon his blood,
4 3325 And new create his fault?
4 3326   Iago. Alas, alas:
4 3327 It is not honestie in me to speake
4 3328 What I haue seene, and knowne. You shall obserue him,
4 3329 And his owne courses will denote him so,
4 3330 That I may saue my speech: do but go after
4 3331 And marke how he continues
4 3332 
4 3333    Lod. I am sorry that I am deceiu'd in him.
4 3334 
4 3335 Exeunt.
4 3336 
4 3337 
4 3338 Scena Secunda.
4 3339 
4 3340 Enter Othello and aemilia.
4 3341 
4 3342   Othe. You haue seene nothing then?
4 3343 Aemil. Nor euer heard: nor euer did suspect
4 3344 
4 3345    Othe. Yes, you haue seene Cassio, and she together
4 3346 
4 3347    Aemi. But then I saw no harme: and then I heard,
4 3348 Each syllable that breath made vp betweene them
4 3349 
4 3350    Othe. What? Did they neuer whisper?
4 3351 Aemil. Neuer my Lord
4 3352 
4 3353    Othe. Nor send you out o'th' way?
4 3354 Aemil. Neuer
4 3355 
4 3356    Othe. To fetch her Fan, her Gloues, her Mask, nor nothing?
4 3357 Aemil. Neuer my Lord
4 3358 
4 3359    Othe. That's strange.
4 3360 Aemil. I durst (my Lord) to wager, she is honest:
4 3361 Lay downe my Soule at stake: If you thinke other,
4 3362 Remoue your thought. It doth abuse your bosome:
4 3363 If any wretch haue put this in your head,
4 3364 Let Heauen requit it with the Serpents curse,
4 3365 For if she be not honest, chaste, and true,
4 3366 There's no man happy. The purest of their Wiues
4 3367 Is foule as Slander
4 3368 
4 3369    Othe. Bid her come hither: go.
4 3370 
4 3371 Exit aemilia.
4 3372 
4 3373 She saies enough: yet she's a simple Baud
4 3374 That cannot say as much. This is a subtile Whore:
4 3375 A Closset Locke and Key of Villanous Secrets,
4 3376 And yet she'le kneele, and pray: I haue seene her do't.
4 3377 Enter Desdemona, and aemilia.
4 3378 
4 3379   Des. My Lord, what is your will?
4 3380   Othe. Pray you Chucke come hither
4 3381 
4 3382    Des. What is your pleasure?
4 3383   Oth. Let me see your eyes: looke in my face
4 3384 
4 3385    Des. What horrible Fancie's this?
4 3386   Othe. Some of your Function Mistris:
4 3387 Leaue Procreants alone, and shut the doore:
4 3388 Cough, or cry hem; if any body come:
4 3389 Your Mystery, your Mystery: May dispatch.
4 3390 
4 3391 Exit aemi.
4 3392 
4 3393   Des. Vpon my knee, what doth your speech import?
4 3394 I vnderstand a Fury in your words
4 3395 
4 3396    Othe. Why? What art thou?
4 3397   Des. Your wife my Lord: your true and loyall wife
4 3398 
4 3399    Othello. Come sweare it: damne thy selfe, least
4 3400 being like one of Heauen, the diuells themselues should
4 3401 feare to ceaze thee. Therefore be double damn'd: sweare
4 3402 thou art honest
4 3403 
4 3404    Des. Heauen doth truely know it
4 3405 
4 3406    Othe. Heauen truely knowes, that thou art false as hell
4 3407 
4 3408    Des. To whom my Lord?
4 3409 With whom? How am I false?
4 3410   Othe. Ah Desdemon, away, away, away
4 3411 
4 3412    Des. Alas the heauy day: why do you weepe?
4 3413 Am I the motiue of these teares my Lord?
4 3414 If happely you my Father do suspect,
4 3415 An Instrument of this your calling backe,
4 3416 Lay not your blame on me: if you haue lost him,
4 3417 I haue lost him too
4 3418 
4 3419    Othe. Had it pleas'd Heauen,
4 3420 To try me with Affliction, had they rain'd
4 3421 All kind of Sores, and Shames on my bare-head:
4 3422 Steep'd me in pouertie to the very lippes.
4 3423 Giuen to Captiuitie, me, and my vtmost hopes,
4 3424 I should haue found in some place of my Soule
4 3425 A drop of patience. But alas, to make me
4 3426 The fixed Figure for the time of Scorne,
4 3427 To point his slow, and mouing finger at.
4 3428 Yet could I beare that too, well, very well:
4 3429 But there where I haue garnerd vp my heart,
4 3430 Where either I must liue, or beare no life,
4 3431 The Fountaine from the which my currant runnes,
4 3432 Or else dries vp: to be discarded thence,
4 3433 Or keepe it as a Cesterne, for foule Toades
4 3434 To knot and gender in. Turne thy complexion there:
4 3435 Patience, thou young and Rose-lip'd Cherubin,
4 3436 I heere looke grim as hell
4 3437 
4 3438    Des. I hope my Noble Lord esteemes me honest
4 3439 
4 3440    Othe. Oh I, as Sommer Flyes are in the Shambles,
4 3441 That quicken euen with blowing. Oh thou weed:
4 3442 Who art so louely faire, and smell'st so sweete,
4 3443 That the Sense akes at thee,
4 3444 Would thou had'st neuer bin borne
4 3445 
4 3446    Des. Alas, what ignorant sin haue I committed?
4 3447   Othe. Was this faire Paper? This most goodly Booke
4 3448 Made to write Whore vpon? What commited,
4 3449 Committed? Oh, thou publicke Commoner,
4 3450 I should make very Forges of my cheekes,
4 3451 That would to Cynders burne vp Modestie,
4 3452 Did I but speake thy deedes. What commited?
4 3453 Heauen stoppes the Nose at it, and the Moone winks:
4 3454 The baudy winde that kisses all it meetes,
4 3455 Is hush'd within the hollow Myne of Earth
4 3456 And will not hear't. What commited?
4 3457   Des. By Heauen you do me wrong
4 3458 
4 3459    Othe. Are not you a Strumpet?
4 3460   Des. No, as I am a Christian.
4 3461 If to preserue this vessell for my Lord,
4 3462 From any other foule vnlawfull touch
4 3463 Be not to be a Strumpet, I am none
4 3464 
4 3465    Othe. What, not a Whore?
4 3466   Des. No, as I shall be sau'd
4 3467 
4 3468    Othe. Is't possible?
4 3469   Des. Oh Heauen forgiue vs
4 3470 
4 3471    Othe. I cry you mercy then.
4 3472 I tooke you for that cunning Whore of Venice,
4 3473 That married with Othello. You Mistris,
4 3474 Enter aemilia.
4 3475 
4 3476 That haue the office opposite to Saint Peter,
4 3477 And keepes the gate of hell. You, you: I you.
4 3478 We haue done our course: there's money for your paines:
4 3479 I pray you turne the key, and keepe our counsaile.
4 3480 Enter.
4 3481 
4 3482 Aemil. Alas, what do's this Gentleman conceiue?
4 3483 How do you Madam? how do you my good Lady?
4 3484   Des. Faith, halfe a sleepe
4 3485 
4 3486    Aemi. Good Madam,
4 3487 What's the matter with my Lord?
4 3488   Des. With who?
4 3489 Aemil. Why, with my Lord, Madam?
4 3490   Des. Who is thy Lord?
4 3491 Aemil. He that is yours, sweet Lady
4 3492 
4 3493    Des. I haue none: do not talke to me, aemilia,
4 3494 I cannot weepe: nor answeres haue I none,
4 3495 But what should go by water. Prythee to night,
4 3496 Lay on my bed my wedding sheetes, remember,
4 3497 And call thy husband hither.
4 3498 Aemil. Heere's a change indeed.
4 3499 Enter.
4 3500 
4 3501   Des. 'Tis meete I should be vs'd so: very meete.
4 3502 How haue I bin behau'd, that he might sticke
4 3503 The small'st opinion on my least misvse?
4 3504 Enter Iago, and aemilia.
4 3505 
4 3506   Iago. What is your pleasure Madam?
4 3507 How is't with you?
4 3508   Des. I cannot tell: those that do teach yong Babes
4 3509 Do it with gentle meanes, and easie taskes.
4 3510 He might haue chid me so; for in good faith
4 3511 I am a Child to chiding
4 3512 
4 3513    Iago. What is the matter Lady?
4 3514 Aemil. Alas (Iago) my Lord hath so bewhor'd her,
4 3515 Throwne such dispight, and heauy termes vpon her
4 3516 That true hearts cannot beare it
4 3517 
4 3518    Des. Am I that name, Iago?
4 3519   Iago. What name, (faire Lady?)
4 3520   Des. Such as she said my Lord did say I was.
4 3521 Aemil. He call'd her whore: a Begger in his drinke:
4 3522 Could not haue laid such termes vpon his Callet
4 3523 
4 3524    Iago. Why did he so?
4 3525   Des. I do not know: I am sure I am none such
4 3526 
4 3527    Iago. Do not weepe, do not weepe: alas the day.
4 3528 Aemil. Hath she forsooke so many Noble Matches?
4 3529 Her Father? And her Country? And her Friends?
4 3530 To be call'd Whore? Would it not make one weepe?
4 3531   Des. It is my wretched Fortune
4 3532 
4 3533    Iago. Beshrew him for't:
4 3534 How comes this Tricke vpon him?
4 3535   Des. Nay, Heauen doth know
4 3536 
4 3537    Aemi. I will be hang'd, if some eternall Villaine,
4 3538 Some busie and insinuating Rogue,
4 3539 Some cogging, cozening Slaue, to get some Office,
4 3540 Haue not deuis'd this Slander: I will be hang'd else
4 3541 
4 3542    Iago. Fie, there is no such man: it is impossible
4 3543 
4 3544    Des. If any such there be, Heauen pardon him.
4 3545 Aemil. A halter pardon him:
4 3546 And hell gnaw his bones.
4 3547 Why should he call her Whore?
4 3548 Who keepes her companie?
4 3549 What Place? What Time?
4 3550 What Forme? What liklyhood?
4 3551 The Moore's abus'd by some most villanous Knaue,
4 3552 Some base notorious Knaue, some scuruy Fellow.
4 3553 Oh Heauens, that such companions thou'd'st vnfold,
4 3554 And put in euery honest hand a whip
4 3555 To lash the Rascalls naked through the world,
4 3556 Euen from the East to th' West
4 3557 
4 3558    Iago. Speake within doore.
4 3559 Aemil. Oh fie vpon them: some such Squire he was
4 3560 That turn'd your wit, the seamy-side without,
4 3561 And made you to suspect me with the Moore
4 3562 
4 3563    Iago. You are a Foole: go too
4 3564 
4 3565    Des. Alas Iago,
4 3566 What shall I do to win my Lord againe?
4 3567 Good Friend, go to him: for by this light of Heauen,
4 3568 I know not how I lost him. Heere I kneele:
4 3569 If ere my will did trespasse 'gainst his Loue,
4 3570 Either in discourse of thought, or actuall deed,
4 3571 Or that mine Eyes, mine Eares, or any Sence
4 3572 Delighted them: or any other Forme.
4 3573 Or that I do not yet, and euer did,
4 3574 And euer will, (though he do shake me off
4 3575 To beggerly diuorcement) Loue him deerely,
4 3576 Comfort forsweare me. Vnkindnesse may do much,
4 3577 And his vnkindnesse may defeat my life,
4 3578 But neuer taynt my Loue. I cannot say Whore,
4 3579 It do's abhorre me now I speake the word,
4 3580 To do the Act, that might the addition earne,
4 3581 Not the worlds Masse of vanitie could make me
4 3582 
4 3583    Iago. I pray you be content: 'tis but his humour:
4 3584 The businesse of the State do's him offence
4 3585 
4 3586    Des. If 'twere no other
4 3587 
4 3588    Iago. It is but so, I warrant,
4 3589 Hearke how these Instruments summon to supper:
4 3590 The Messengers of Venice staies the meate,
4 3591 Go in, and weepe not: all things shall be well.
4 3592 
4 3593 Exeunt. Desdemona and aemilia.
4 3594 
4 3595 Enter Rodorigo.
4 3596 
4 3597 How now Rodorigo?
4 3598   Rod. I do not finde
4 3599 That thou deal'st iustly with me
4 3600 
4 3601    Iago. What in the contrarie?
4 3602   Rodori. Euery day thou dafts me with some deuise
4 3603 Iago, and rather, as it seemes to me now, keep'st from
4 3604 me all conueniencie, then suppliest me with the least aduantage
4 3605 of hope: I will indeed no longer endure it. Nor
4 3606 am I yet perswaded to put vp in peace, what already I
4 3607 haue foolishly suffred
4 3608 
4 3609    Iago. Will you heare me Rodorigo?
4 3610   Rodori. I haue heard too much: and your words and
4 3611 Performances are no kin together
4 3612 
4 3613    Iago. You charge me most vniustly
4 3614 
4 3615    Rodo. With naught but truth: I haue wasted my
4 3616 selfe out of my meanes. The Iewels you haue had from
4 3617 me to deliuer Desdemona, would halfe haue corrupted a
4 3618 Votarist. You haue told me she hath receiu'd them,
4 3619 and return'd me expectations and comforts of sodaine
4 3620 respect, and acquaintance, but I finde none
4 3621 
4 3622    Iago. Well, go too: very well
4 3623 
4 3624    Rod. Very well, go too: I cannot go too, (man) nor
4 3625 'tis not very well. Nay I think it is scuruy: and begin to
4 3626 finde my selfe fopt in it
4 3627 
4 3628    Iago. Very well
4 3629 
4 3630    Rodor. I tell you, 'tis not very well: I will make my
4 3631 selfe knowne to Desdemona. If she will returne me my
4 3632 Iewels, I will giue ouer my Suit, and repent my vnlawfull
4 3633 solicitation. If not, assure your selfe, I will seeke
4 3634 satisfaction of you
4 3635 
4 3636    Iago. You haue said now
4 3637 
4 3638    Rodo. I: and said nothing but what I protest intendment
4 3639 of doing
4 3640 
4 3641    Iago. Why, now I see there's mettle in thee: and
4 3642 euen from this instant do build on thee a better opinion
4 3643 then euer before: giue me thy hand Rodorigo.
4 3644 Thou hast taken against me a most iust exception:
4 3645 but yet I protest I haue dealt most directly in thy
4 3646 Affaire
4 3647 
4 3648    Rod. It hath not appeer'd
4 3649 
4 3650    Iago. I grant indeed it hath not appeer'd: and
4 3651 your suspition is not without wit and iudgement.
4 3652 But Rodorigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which
4 3653 I haue greater reason to beleeue now then euer (I
4 3654 meane purpose, Courage, and Valour) this night
4 3655 shew it. If thou the next night following enioy not
4 3656 Desdemona, take me from this world with Treacherie,
4 3657 and deuise Engines for my life
4 3658 
4 3659    Rod. Well: what is it? Is it within, reason and compasse?
4 3660   Iago. Sir, there is especiall Commission come from
4 3661 Venice to depute Cassio in Othello's place
4 3662 
4 3663    Rod. Is that true? Why then Othello and Desdemona
4 3664 returne againe to Venice
4 3665 
4 3666    Iago. Oh no: he goes into Mauritania and taketh
4 3667 away with him the faire Desdemona, vnlesse his abode
4 3668 be lingred heere by some accident. Wherein
4 3669 none can be so determinate, as the remouing of
4 3670 Cassio
4 3671 
4 3672    Rod. How do you meane remouing him?
4 3673   Iago. Why, by making him vncapable of Othello's
4 3674 place: knocking out his braines
4 3675 
4 3676    Rod. And that you would haue me to do
4 3677 
4 3678    Iago. I: if you dare do your selfe a profit, and a
4 3679 right. He sups to night with a Harlotry: and thither
4 3680 will I go to him. He knowes not yet of his Honourable
4 3681 Fortune, if you will watch his going thence (which
4 3682 I will fashion to fall out betweene twelue and one)
4 3683 you may take him at your pleasure. I will be neere
4 3684 to second your Attempt, and he shall fall betweene
4 3685 vs. Come, stand not amaz'd at it, but go along with
4 3686 me: I will shew you such a necessitie in his death, that
4 3687 you shall thinke your selfe bound to put it on him. It
4 3688 is now high supper time: and the night growes to wast.
4 3689 About it
4 3690 
4 3691    Rod. I will heare further reason for this
4 3692 
4 3693    Iago. And you shalbe satisfi'd.
4 3694 
4 3695 Exeunt.
4 3696 
4 3697 
4 3698 Scena Tertia.
4 3699 
4 3700 Enter Othello, Lodouico, Desdemona, aemilia, and Atendants.
4 3701 
4 3702   Lod. I do beseech you Sir, trouble your selfe no further
4 3703 
4 3704    Oth. Oh pardon me: 'twill do me good to walke
4 3705 
4 3706    Lodoui. Madam, good night: I humbly thanke your
4 3707 Ladyship
4 3708 
4 3709    Des. Your Honour is most welcome
4 3710 
4 3711    Oth. Will you walke Sir? Oh Desdemona
4 3712 
4 3713    Des. My Lord
4 3714 
4 3715    Othello. Get you to bed on th' instant, I will be return'd
4 3716 forthwith: dismisse your Attendant there: look't
4 3717 be done.
4 3718 Enter.
4 3719 
4 3720   Des. I will my Lord
4 3721 
4 3722    Aem. How goes it now? He lookes gentler then he did
4 3723 
4 3724    Des. He saies he will returne incontinent,
4 3725 And hath commanded me to go to bed,
4 3726 And bid me to dismisse you
4 3727 
4 3728    Aemi. Dismisse me?
4 3729   Des. It was his bidding: therefore good aemilia,
4 3730 Giue me my nightly wearing, and adieu.
4 3731 We must not now displease him.
4 3732 Aemil. I, would you had neuer seene him
4 3733 
4 3734    Des. So would not I: my loue doth so approue him,
4 3735 That euen his stubbornesse, his checks, his frownes,
4 3736 (Prythee vn-pin me) haue grace and fauour
4 3737 
4 3738    Aemi. I haue laid those Sheetes you bad me on the bed
4 3739 
4 3740    Des. All's one: good Father, how foolish are our minds?
4 3741 If I do die before, prythee shrow'd me
4 3742 In one of these same Sheetes.
4 3743 Aemil. Come, come: you talke
4 3744 
4 3745    Des. My Mother had a Maid call'd Barbarie,
4 3746 She was in loue: and he she lou'd prou'd mad,
4 3747 And did forsake her. She had a Song of Willough,
4 3748 An old thing 'twas: but it express'd her Fortune,
4 3749 And she dy'd singing it. That Song to night,
4 3750 Will not go from my mind: I haue much to do,
4 3751 But to go hang my head all at one side
4 3752 And sing it like poore Barbarie: prythee dispatch
4 3753 
4 3754    Aemi. Shall I go fetch your Night-gowne?
4 3755   Des. No, vn-pin me here,
4 3756 This Lodouico is a proper man.
4 3757 Aemil. A very handsome man
4 3758 
4 3759    Des. He speakes well.
4 3760 Aemil. I know a Lady in Venice would haue walk'd
4 3761 barefoot to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip
4 3762 
4 3763    Des. The poore Soule sat singing, by a Sicamour tree.
4 3764 Sing all a greene Willough:
4 3765 Her hand on her bosome her head on her knee,
4 3766 Sing Willough, Willough, Willough.
4 3767 The fresh Streames ran by her, and murmur'd her moanes
4 3768 Sing Willough, &c.
4 3769 Her salt teares fell from her, and softned the stones,
4 3770 Sing Willough, &c. (Lay by these)
4 3771 Willough, Willough. (Prythee high thee: he'le come anon)
4 3772 Sing all a greene Willough must be my Garland.
4 3773 Let no body blame him, his scorne I approue.
4 3774 (Nay that's not next. Harke, who is't that knocks?
4 3775 Aemil. It's the wind
4 3776 
4 3777    Des. I call'd my Loue false Loue: but what said he then?
4 3778 Sing Willough, &c.
4 3779 If I court mo women, you'le couch with mo men.
4 3780 So get thee gone, good night: mine eyes do itch:
4 3781 Doth that boade weeping?
4 3782 Aemil. 'Tis neyther heere, nor there
4 3783 
4 3784    Des. I haue heard it said so. O these Men, these men!
4 3785 Do'st thou in conscience thinke (tell me aemilia)
4 3786 That there be women do abuse their husbands
4 3787 In such grosse kinde?
4 3788 Aemil. There be some such, no question
4 3789 
4 3790    Des. Would'st thou do such a deed for all the world?
4 3791 Aemil. Why, would not you?
4 3792   Des. No, by this Heauenly light.
4 3793 Aemil. Nor I neither, by this Heauenly light:
4 3794 I might doo't as well i'th' darke
4 3795 
4 3796    Des. Would'st thou do such a deed for al the world?
4 3797 Aemil. The world's a huge thing:
4 3798 It is a great price, for a small vice
4 3799 
4 3800    Des. Introth, I thinke thou would'st not.
4 3801 Aemil. Introth I thinke I should, and vndoo't when
4 3802 I had done. Marry, I would not doe such a thing for a
4 3803 ioynt Ring, nor for measures of Lawne, nor for Gownes,
4 3804 Petticoats, nor Caps, nor any petty exhibition. But for
4 3805 all the whole world: why, who would not make her husband
4 3806 a Cuckold, to make him a Monarch? I should venture
4 3807 Purgatory for't
4 3808 
4 3809    Des. Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong
4 3810 For the whole world.
4 3811 Aemil. Why, the wrong is but a wrong i'th' world;
4 3812 and hauing the world for your labour, 'tis a wrong in
4 3813 your owne world, and you might quickly make it right
4 3814 
4 3815    Des. I do not thinke there is any such woman.
4 3816 Aemil. Yes, a dozen: and as many to'th' vantage, as
4 3817 would store the world they plaid for.
4 3818 But I do thinke it is their Husbands faults
4 3819 If Wiues do fall: (Say, that they slacke their duties,
4 3820 And powre our Treasures into forraigne laps;
4 3821 Or else breake out in peeuish Iealousies,
4 3822 Throwing restraint vpon vs: Or say they strike vs,
4 3823 Or scant our former hauing in despight)
4 3824 Why we haue galles: and though we haue some Grace,
4 3825 Yet haue we some Reuenge. Let Husbands know,
4 3826 Their wiues haue sense like them: They see, and smell,
4 3827 And haue their Palats both for sweet, and sowre,
4 3828 As Husbands haue. What is it that they do,
4 3829 When they change vs for others? Is it Sport?
4 3830 I thinke it is: and doth Affection breed it?
4 3831 I thinke it doth. Is't Frailty that thus erres?
4 3832 It is so too. And haue not we Affections?
4 3833 Desires for Sport? and Frailty, as men haue?
4 3834 Then let them vse vs well: else let them know,
4 3835 The illes we do, their illes instruct vs so
4 3836 
4 3837    Des. Good night, good night:
4 3838 Heauen me such vses send,
4 3839 Not to picke bad, from bad; but by bad, mend.
4 3840 
4 3841 Exeunt.
4 3842 
4 3843 Actus Quintus. Scena Prima.
4 3844 
4 3845 Enter Iago, and Rodorigo.
4 3846 
4 3847   Iago. Heere, stand behinde this Barke,
4 3848 Straight will he come:
4 3849 Weare thy good Rapier bare, and put it home:
4 3850 Quicke, quicke, feare nothing; Ile be at thy Elbow,
4 3851 It makes vs, or it marres vs, thinke on that,
4 3852 And fixe most firme thy Resolution
4 3853 
4 3854    Rod. Be neere at hand, I may miscarry in't
4 3855 
4 3856    Iago. Heere, at thy hand: Be bold, & take thy stand
4 3857 
4 3858    Rod. I haue no great deuotion to the deed,
4 3859 And yet he hath giuen me satisfying Reasons:
4 3860 'Tis but a man gone. Forth my Sword: he dies
4 3861 
4 3862    Iago. I haue rub'd this yong Quat almost to the sense,
4 3863 And he growes angry. Now, whether he kill Cassio,
4 3864 Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other,
4 3865 Euery way makes my gaine. Liue Rodorigo,
4 3866 He calles me to a restitution large
4 3867 Of Gold, and Iewels, that I bob'd from him,
4 3868 As Guifts to Desdemona.
4 3869 It must not be: If Cassio do remaine,
4 3870 He hath a dayly beauty in his life,
4 3871 That makes me vgly: and besides, the Moore
4 3872 May vnfold me to him: there stand I in much perill:
4 3873 No, he must dye. But so, I heard him comming.
4 3874 Enter Cassio.
4 3875 
4 3876   Rod. I know his gate, 'tis he: Villaine thou dyest
4 3877 
4 3878    Cas. That thrust had beene mine enemy indeed,
4 3879 But that my Coate is better then thou know'st:
4 3880 I will make proofe of thine
4 3881 
4 3882    Rod. Oh, I am slaine
4 3883 
4 3884    Cassio. I am maym'd for euer:
4 3885 Helpe hoa: Murther, murther.
4 3886 Enter Othello.
4 3887 
4 3888   Oth. The voyce of Cassio. Iago keepes his word
4 3889 
4 3890    Rod. O Villaine that I am
4 3891 
4 3892    Oth. It is euen so
4 3893 
4 3894    Cas. Oh helpe hoa: Light, a Surgeon
4 3895 
4 3896    Oth. 'Tis he: O braue Iago, honest, and iust,
4 3897 That hast such Noble sense of thy Friends wrong,
4 3898 Thou teachest me. Minion, your deere lyes dead,
4 3899 And your vnblest Fate highes: Strumpet I come:
4 3900 For of my heart, those Charmes thine Eyes, are blotted.
4 3901 Thy Bed lust-stain'd, shall with Lusts blood bee spotted.
4 3902 
4 3903 Exit Othello.
4 3904 
4 3905 Enter Lodouico and Gratiano.
4 3906 
4 3907   Cas. What hoa? no Watch? No passage?
4 3908 Murther, Murther
4 3909 
4 3910    Gra. 'Tis some mischance, the voyce is very direfull
4 3911 
4 3912    Cas. Oh helpe
4 3913 
4 3914    Lodo. Hearke
4 3915 
4 3916    Rod. Oh wretched Villaine
4 3917 
4 3918    Lod. Two or three groane. 'Tis heauy night;
4 3919 These may be counterfeits: Let's think't vnsafe
4 3920 To come into the cry, without more helpe
4 3921 
4 3922    Rod. Nobody come: then shall I bleed to death.
4 3923 Enter Iago.
4 3924 
4 3925   Lod. Hearke
4 3926 
4 3927    Gra. Here's one comes in his shirt, with Light, and
4 3928 Weapons
4 3929 
4 3930    Iago. Who's there?
4 3931 Who's noyse is this that cries on murther?
4 3932   Lodo. We do not know
4 3933 
4 3934    Iago. Do not you heare a cry?
4 3935   Cas. Heere, heere: for heauen sake helpe me
4 3936 
4 3937    Iago. What's the matter?
4 3938   Gra. This is Othello's Ancient, as I take it
4 3939 
4 3940    Lodo. The same indeede, a very valiant Fellow
4 3941 
4 3942    Iago. What are you heere, that cry so greeuously?
4 3943   Cas. Iago? Oh I am spoyl'd, vndone by Villaines:
4 3944 Giue me some helpe
4 3945 
4 3946    Iago. O mee, Lieutenant!
4 3947 What Villaines haue done this?
4 3948   Cas. I thinke that one of them is heereabout.
4 3949 And cannot make away
4 3950 
4 3951    Iago. Oh treacherous Villaines:
4 3952 What are you there? Come in, and giue some helpe
4 3953 
4 3954    Rod. O helpe me there
4 3955 
4 3956    Cassio. That's one of them
4 3957 
4 3958    Iago. Oh murd'rous Slaue! O Villaine!
4 3959   Rod. O damn'd Iago! O inhumane Dogge!
4 3960   Iago. Kill men i'th' darke?
4 3961 Where be these bloody Theeues?
4 3962 How silent is this Towne? Hoa, murther, murther.
4 3963 What may you be? Are you of good, or euill?
4 3964   Lod. As you shall proue vs, praise vs
4 3965 
4 3966    Iago. Signior Lodouico?
4 3967   Lod. He Sir
4 3968 
4 3969    Iago. I cry you mercy: here's Cassio hurt by Villaines
4 3970 
4 3971    Gra. Cassio?
4 3972   Iago. How is't Brother?
4 3973   Cas. My Legge is cut in two
4 3974 
4 3975    Iago. Marry heauen forbid:
4 3976 Light Gentlemen, Ile binde it with my shirt.
4 3977 Enter Bianca.
4 3978 
4 3979   Bian. What is the matter hoa? Who is't that cry'd?
4 3980   Iago. Who is't that cry'd?
4 3981   Bian. Oh my deere Cassio,
4 3982 My sweet Cassio: Oh Cassio, Cassio, Cassio
4 3983 
4 3984    Iago. O notable Strumpet. Cassio, may you suspect
4 3985 Who they should be, that haue thus mangled you?
4 3986   Cas. No
4 3987 
4 3988    Gra. I am sorry to finde you thus;
4 3989 I haue beene to seeke you
4 3990 
4 3991    Iago. Lend me a Garter. So: - Oh for a Chaire
4 3992 To beare him easily hence
4 3993 
4 3994    Bian. Alas he faints. Oh Cassio, Cassio, Cassio
4 3995 
4 3996    Iago. Gentlemen all, I do suspect this Trash
4 3997 To be a party in this Iniurie.
4 3998 Patience awhile, good Cassio. Come, come;
4 3999 Lend me a Light: know we this face, or no?
4 4000 Alas my Friend, and my deere Countryman
4 4001 Rodorigo? No: Yes sure: Yes, 'tis Rodorigo
4 4002 
4 4003    Gra. What, of Venice?
4 4004   Iago. Euen he Sir: Did you know him?
4 4005   Gra. Know him? I
4 4006 
4 4007    Iago. Signior Gratiano? I cry your gentle pardon:
4 4008 These bloody accidents must excuse my Manners,
4 4009 That so neglected you
4 4010 
4 4011    Gra. I am glad to see you
4 4012 
4 4013    Iago. How do you Cassio? Oh, a Chaire, a Chaire
4 4014 
4 4015    Gra. Rodorigo?
4 4016   Iago. He, he, 'tis he:
4 4017 Oh that's well said, the Chaire.
4 4018 Some good man beare him carefully from hence,
4 4019 Ile fetch the Generall's Surgeon. For you Mistris,
4 4020 Saue you your labour. He that lies slaine heere (Cassio)
4 4021 Was my deere friend. What malice was between you
4 4022 
4 4023    Cas. None in the world: nor do I know the man?
4 4024   Iago. What? looke you pale? Oh beare him o'th' Ayre.
4 4025 Stay you good Gentlemen. Looke you pale, Mistris?
4 4026 Do you perceiue the gastnesse of her eye?
4 4027 Nay, if you stare, we shall heare more anon.
4 4028 Behold her well: I pray you looke vpon her:
4 4029 Do you see Gentlemen? Nay, guiltinesse will speake
4 4030 Though tongues were out of vse.
4 4031 Aemil. Alas, what is the matter?
4 4032 What is the matter, Husband?
4 4033   Iago. Cassio hath heere bin set on in the darke
4 4034 By Rodorigo, and Fellowes that are scap'd:
4 4035 He's almost slaine, and Rodorigo quite dead.
4 4036 Aemil. Alas good Gentleman: alas good Cassio
4 4037 
4 4038    Iago. This is the fruits of whoring. Prythe aemilia,
4 4039 Go know of Cassio where he supt to night.
4 4040 What, do you shake at that?
4 4041   Bian. He supt at my house, but I therefore shake not
4 4042 
4 4043    Iago. O did he so? I charge you go with me.
4 4044 Aemil. Oh fie vpon thee Strumpet
4 4045 
4 4046    Bian. I am no Strumpet, but of life as honest,
4 4047 As you that thus abuse me.
4 4048 Aemil. As I? Fie vpon thee
4 4049 
4 4050    Iago. Kinde Gentlemen:
4 4051 Let's go see poore Cassio drest.
4 4052 Come Mistris, you must tel's another Tale.
4 4053 aemilia, run you to the Cittadell,
4 4054 And tell my Lord and Lady, what hath happ'd:
4 4055 Will you go on afore? This is the night
4 4056 That either makes me, or foredoes me quight.
4 4057 
4 4058 Exeunt.
4 4059 
4 4060 Scoena Secunda.
4 4061 
4 4062 Enter Othello, and Desdemona in her bed.
4 4063 
4 4064   Oth. It is the Cause, it is the Cause (my Soule)
4 4065 Let me not name it to you, you chaste Starres,
4 4066 It is the Cause. Yet Ile not shed her blood,
4 4067 Nor scarre that whiter skin of hers, then Snow,
4 4068 And smooth as Monumentall Alablaster:
4 4069 Yet she must dye, else shee'l betray more men:
4 4070 Put out the Light, and then put out the Light:
4 4071 If I quench thee, thou flaming Minister,
4 4072 I can againe thy former light restore,
4 4073 Should I repent me. But once put out thy Light,
4 4074 Thou cunning'st Patterne of excelling Nature,
4 4075 I know not where is that Promethaean heate
4 4076 That can thy Light re-Lume.
4 4077 When I haue pluck'd thy Rose,
4 4078 I cannot giue it vitall growth againe,
4 4079 It needs must wither. Ile smell thee on the Tree.
4 4080 Oh Balmy breath, that dost almost perswade
4 4081 Iustice to breake her Sword. One more, one more:
4 4082 Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee,
4 4083 And loue thee after. One more, and that's the last.
4 4084 So sweet, was ne're so fatall. I must weepe,
4 4085 But they are cruell Teares: This sorrow's heauenly,
4 4086 It strikes, where it doth loue. She wakes
4 4087 
4 4088    Des. Who's there? Othello?
4 4089   Othel. I Desdemona
4 4090 
4 4091    Des. Will you come to bed, my Lord?
4 4092   Oth. Haue you pray'd to night, Desdemon?
4 4093   Des. I my Lord
4 4094 
4 4095    Oth. If you bethinke your selfe of any Crime
4 4096 Vnreconcil'd as yet to Heauen, and Grace,
4 4097 Solicite for it straight
4 4098 
4 4099    Des. Alacke, my Lord,
4 4100 What may you meane by that?
4 4101   Oth. Well, do it, and be breefe, I will walke by:
4 4102 I would not kill thy vnprepared Spirit,
4 4103 No, Heauens fore-fend) I would not kill thy Soule
4 4104 
4 4105    Des. Talke you of killing?
4 4106   Oth. I, I do
4 4107 
4 4108    Des. Then Heauen haue mercy on mee
4 4109 
4 4110    Oth. Amen, with all my heart
4 4111 
4 4112    Des. If you say, I hope you will not kill me
4 4113 
4 4114    Oth. Humh
4 4115 
4 4116    Des. And yet I feare you: for you're fatall then
4 4117 When your eyes rowle so.
4 4118 Why I should feare, I know not,
4 4119 Since guiltinesse I know not: But yet I feele I feare
4 4120 
4 4121    Oth. Thinke on thy sinnes
4 4122 
4 4123    Des. They are Loues I beare to you
4 4124 
4 4125    Oth. I, and for that thou dy'st
4 4126 
4 4127    Des. That death's vnnaturall, that kils for louing.
4 4128 Alas, why gnaw you so your nether-lip?
4 4129 Some bloody passion shakes your very Frame:
4 4130 These are portents: but yet I hope, I hope,
4 4131 They do not point on me
4 4132 
4 4133    Oth. Peace, and be still
4 4134 
4 4135    Des. I will so: What's the matter?
4 4136   Oth. That Handkerchiefe
4 4137 Which I so lou'd, and gaue thee, thou gau'st to Cassio
4 4138 
4 4139    Des. No by my Life, and Soule: send for the man,
4 4140 And aske him
4 4141 
4 4142    Oth. Sweet Soule, take heed, take heed of Periury,
4 4143 Thou art on thy death-bed
4 4144 
4 4145    Des. I, but not yet to dye
4 4146 
4 4147    Oth. Presently.
4 4148 Therefore confesse thee freely of thy sinne:
4 4149 For to deny each Article with Oath,
4 4150 Cannot remoue, nor choake the strong Conception
4 4151 That I do grone withall. Thou art to dye
4 4152 
4 4153    Des. O Heauen haue mercy on me
4 4154 
4 4155    Oth. I say, Amen
4 4156 
4 4157    Des. And haue you mercy too. I neuer did
4 4158 Offend you in my life: neuer lou'd Cassio,
4 4159 But with such generall warrantie of Heauen,
4 4160 As I might loue. I neuer gaue him Token
4 4161 
4 4162    Oth. By Heauen I saw my Handkerchiefe in's hand.
4 4163 O periur'd woman, thou do'st stone my heart,
4 4164 And makes me call, what I intend to do,
4 4165 A Murther, which I thought a Sacrifice.
4 4166 I saw the Handkerchiefe
4 4167 
4 4168    Des. He found it then:
4 4169 I neuer gaue it him: Send, for him hither:
4 4170 Let him confesse a truth
4 4171 
4 4172    Oth. He hath confest
4 4173 
4 4174    Des. What, my Lord?
4 4175   Oth. That he hath vs'd thee
4 4176 
4 4177    Des. How? vnlawfully?
4 4178   Oth. I
4 4179 
4 4180    Des. He will not say so
4 4181 
4 4182    Oth. No: his mouth is stopp'd:
4 4183 Honest Iago hath 'tane order for't
4 4184 
4 4185    Des. Oh, my feare interprets. What is he dead?
4 4186   Oth. Had all his haires bin liues, my great Reuenge
4 4187 Had stomacke for them all
4 4188 
4 4189    Des. Alas, he is betray'd, and I vndone
4 4190 
4 4191    Oth. Out Strumpet: weep'st thou for him to my face?
4 4192   Des. O banish me, my Lord, but kill me not
4 4193 
4 4194    Oth. Downe Strumpet
4 4195 
4 4196    Des. Kill me to morrow, let me liue to night
4 4197 
4 4198    Oth. Nay, if you striue
4 4199 
4 4200    Des. But halfe an houre
4 4201 
4 4202    Oth. Being done, there is no pawse
4 4203 
4 4204    Des. But while I say one prayer
4 4205 
4 4206    Oth. It is too late.
4 4207 
4 4208 Smothers her.
4 4209 
4 4210 aemilia at the doore.
4 4211 
4 4212 Aemil. My Lord, my Lord? What hoa?
4 4213 My Lord, my Lord
4 4214 
4 4215    Oth. What noise is this? Not dead? not yet quite dead?
4 4216 I that am cruell, am yet mercifull,
4 4217 I would not haue thee linger in thy paine?
4 4218 So, so.
4 4219 Aemil. within. What hoa? my Lord, my Lord?
4 4220   Oth. Who's there?
4 4221 Aemil. Oh good my Lord, I would speake a word
4 4222 with you
4 4223 
4 4224    Oth. Yes: 'Tis aemilia: by and by. Shee's dead.
4 4225 'Tis like she comes to speake of Cassio's death:
4 4226 The noise was high. Hah, no more moouing?
4 4227 Still as the Graue. Shall she come in? Wer't good?
4 4228 I thinke she stirres againe. No, what's best to do?
4 4229 If she come in, shee'l sure speake to my wife:
4 4230 My wife, my wife: what wife? I haue no wife.
4 4231 Oh insupportable! Oh heauy houre!
4 4232 Me thinkes, it should be now a huge Eclipse
4 4233 Of Sunne, and Moone; and that th' affrighted Globe
4 4234 Did yawne at Alteration.
4 4235 Aemil. I do beseech you
4 4236 That I may speake with you. Oh good my Lord
4 4237 
4 4238    Oth. I had forgot thee: oh come in aemilia.
4 4239 Soft, by and by, let me the Curtaines draw.
4 4240 Where art thou? What's the matter with thee now?
4 4241 Enter aemilia.
4 4242 
4 4243 Aemil. Oh my good Lord, yonders foule Murthers
4 4244 done
4 4245 
4 4246    Oth. What? now?
4 4247 Aemil. But now, my Lord
4 4248 
4 4249    Oth. It is the very error of the Moone,
4 4250 She comes more neerer Earth then she was wont,
4 4251 And makes men mad.
4 4252 Aemil. Cassio, my Lord, hath kill'd
4 4253 A young Venetian, call'd Rodorigo
4 4254 
4 4255    Oth. Rodorigo kill'd? and Cassio kill'd?
4 4256 Aemil. No, Cassio is not kill'd
4 4257 
4 4258    Oth. Not Cassio kill'd? Then Murther's out of tune,
4 4259 And sweet Reuenge growes harsh
4 4260 
4 4261    Des. O falsely, falsely murder'd.
4 4262 Aemil. Alas! what cry is that?
4 4263   Oth. That? What?
4 4264 Aemil. Out, and alas, that was my Ladies voice.
4 4265 Helpe, helpe hoa, helpe. Oh Ladie speake againe,
4 4266 Sweet Desdemona, oh sweet Mistris, speake
4 4267 
4 4268    Des. A guiltlesse death, I dye.
4 4269 Aemil. Oh who hath done this deed?
4 4270   Des. No body: I my selfe, farewell:
4 4271 Commend me to my kinde Lord: oh farewell
4 4272 
4 4273    Oth. Why, how should she be murdred?
4 4274 Aemil. Alas: who knowes?
4 4275   Oth. You heare her say her selfe, it was not I.
4 4276 Aemil. She said so: I must needs report the truth
4 4277 
4 4278    Oth. She's like a Liar gone to burning hell,
4 4279 'Twas I that kill'd her.
4 4280 Aemil. Oh the more Angell she, and you the blacker
4 4281 Diuell
4 4282 
4 4283    Oth. She turn'd to folly: and she was a whore.
4 4284 Aemil. Thou do'st bely her, and thou art a diuell
4 4285 
4 4286    Oth. She was false as water.
4 4287 Aemil. Thou art rash as fire, to say
4 4288 That she was false. Oh she was heauenly true
4 4289 
4 4290    Oth. Cassio did top her: Ask thy husband else.
4 4291 O, I were damn'd beneath all depth in hell:
4 4292 But that I did proceed vpon iust grounds
4 4293 To this extremity. Thy Husband knew it all.
4 4294 Aemil. My Husband?
4 4295   Oth. Thy Husband.
4 4296 Aemil. That she was false to Wedlocke?
4 4297   Oth. I, with Cassio: had she bin true,
4 4298 If Heauen would make me such another world,
4 4299 Of one entyre and perfect Chrysolite,
4 4300 I'ld not haue sold her for it.
4 4301 Aemil. My Husband?
4 4302   Oth. I, 'twas he that told me on her first,
4 4303 An honest man he is, and hates the slime
4 4304 That stickes on filthy deeds.
4 4305 Aemil. My Husband?
4 4306   Oth. What needs this itterance, Woman?
4 4307 I say, thy Husband.
4 4308 Aemil. Oh Mistris,
4 4309 Villany hath made mockes with loue:
4 4310 My Husband say she was false?
4 4311   Oth. He, Woman;
4 4312 I say thy Husband: Do'st vnderstand the word?
4 4313 My Friend, thy Husband; honest, honest Iago.
4 4314 Aemil. If he say so, may his pernicious Soule
4 4315 Rot halfe a graine a day: he lyes to'th' heart,
4 4316 She was too fond of her most filthy Bargaine
4 4317 
4 4318    Oth. Hah?
4 4319 Aemil. Do thy worst:
4 4320 This deede of thine is no more worthy Heauen,
4 4321 Then thou was't worthy her
4 4322 
4 4323    Oth. Peace, you were best.
4 4324 Aemil. Thou hast not halfe that powre to do me harm,
4 4325 As I haue to be hurt. Oh Gull, oh dolt,
4 4326 As ignorant as durt: thou hast done a deed
4 4327 (I care not for thy Sword) Ile make thee known,
4 4328 Though I lost twenty liues. Helpe, helpe, hoa, helpe:
4 4329 The Moore hath kill'd my Mistris. Murther, murther.
4 4330 Enter Montano, Gratiano, and Iago.
4 4331 
4 4332   Mon. What is the matter? How now Generall?
4 4333 Aemil. Oh, are you come, Iago: you haue done well,
4 4334 That men must lay their Murthers on your necke
4 4335 
4 4336    Gra. What is the matter?
4 4337 Aemil. Disproue this Villaine, if thou bee'st a man:
4 4338 He sayes, thou told'st him that his wife was false:
4 4339 I know thou did'st not: thou'rt not such a Villain.
4 4340 Speake, for my heart is full
4 4341 
4 4342    Iago. I told him what I thought,
4 4343 And told no more
4 4344 Then what he found himselfe was apt, and true.
4 4345 Aemil. But did you euer tell him,
4 4346 She was false?
4 4347   Iago. I did.
4 4348 Aemil. You told a Lye an odious damned Lye:
4 4349 Vpon my Soule, a Lye; a wicked Lye.
4 4350 Shee false with Cassio?
4 4351 Did you say with Cassio?
4 4352   Iago. With Cassio, Mistris?
4 4353 Go too, charme your tongue
4 4354 
4 4355    Emil. I will not charme my Tongue;
4 4356 I am bound to speake,
4 4357 My Mistris heere lyes murthered in her bed
4 4358 
4 4359    All. Oh Heauens, forefend
4 4360 
4 4361    Emil. And your reports haue set the Murder on
4 4362 
4 4363    Othello. Nay stare not Masters,
4 4364 It is true indeede
4 4365 
4 4366    Gra. 'Tis a strange Truth
4 4367 
4 4368    Mont. O monstrous Acte
4 4369 
4 4370    Emil. Villany, villany, villany:
4 4371 I thinke vpon't, I thinke: I smel't: O Villany:
4 4372 I thought so then: Ile kill my selfe for greefe.
4 4373 O villany! villany!
4 4374   Iago. What, are you mad?
4 4375 I charge you get you home
4 4376 
4 4377    Emil. Good Gentlemen, let me haue leaue to speake:
4 4378 'Tis proper I obey him; but not now:
4 4379 Perchance Iago, I will ne're go home
4 4380 
4 4381    Oth. Oh, oh, oh
4 4382 
4 4383    Emil. Nay, lay thee downe, and roare:
4 4384 For thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocent,
4 4385 That ere did lift vp eye
4 4386 
4 4387    Oth. Oh she was fowle!
4 4388 I scarse did know you Vnkle, there lies your Neece,
4 4389 Whose breath (indeed) these hands haue newly stopp'd:
4 4390 I know this acte shewes horrible and grim
4 4391 
4 4392    Gra. Poore Desdemon:
4 4393 I am glad thy Father's dead,
4 4394 Thy Match was mortall to him: and pure greefe
4 4395 Shore his old thred in twaine. Did he liue now,
4 4396 This sight would make him do a desperate turne:
4 4397 Yea, curse his better Angell from his side,
4 4398 And fall to Reprobance
4 4399 
4 4400    Oth. 'Tis pittifull: but yet Iago knowes
4 4401 That she with Cassio, hath the Act of shame
4 4402 A thousand times committed. Cassio confest it,
4 4403 And she did gratifie his amorous workes
4 4404 With that Recognizance and pledge of Loue
4 4405 Which I first gaue her: I saw it in his hand:
4 4406 It was a Handkerchiefe, an Antique Token
4 4407 My Father gaue my Mother
4 4408 
4 4409    Emil. Oh Heauen! oh heauenly Powres!
4 4410   Iago. Come, hold your peace
4 4411 
4 4412    Emil. 'Twill out, 'twill out. I peace?
4 4413 No, I will speake as liberall as the North;
4 4414 Let Heauen, and Men, and Diuels, let them all,
4 4415 All, all, crie shame against me, yet Ile speake
4 4416 
4 4417    Iago. Be wise, and get you home
4 4418 
4 4419    Emil. I will not
4 4420 
4 4421    Gra. Fye, your Sword vpon a Woman
4 4422 
4 4423    Emil. Oh thou dull Moore,
4 4424 That Handkerchiefe thou speak'st of
4 4425 I found by Fortune, and did giue my Husband:
4 4426 For often, with a solemne earnestnesse,
4 4427 (More then indeed belong'd to such a Trifle)
4 4428 He begg'd of me, to steale't
4 4429 
4 4430    Iago. Villanous Whore
4 4431 
4 4432    Emil. She giue it Cassio? No, alas I found it,
4 4433 And I did giu't my Husband
4 4434 
4 4435    Iago. Filth, thou lyest
4 4436 
4 4437    Emil. By Heauen I do not, I do not Gentlemen:
4 4438 Oh murd'rous Coxcombe, what should such a Foole
4 4439 Do with so good a wife?
4 4440   Oth. Are there no stones in Heauen,
4 4441 But what serues for the Thunder?
4 4442 Precious Villaine
4 4443 
4 4444    Gra. The woman falles:
4 4445 Sure he hath kill'd his Wife
4 4446 
4 4447    Emil. I, I: oh lay me by my Mistris side
4 4448 
4 4449    Gra. Hee's gone, but his wife's kill'd
4 4450 
4 4451    Mon. 'Tis a notorious Villain: take you this weapon
4 4452 Which I haue recouer'd from the Moore:
4 4453 Come guard the doore without, let him not passe,
4 4454 But kill him rather. Ile after that same villaine,
4 4455 For 'tis a damned Slaue.
4 4456 Enter.
4 4457 
4 4458   Oth. I am not valiant neither:
4 4459 But euery Punie whipster gets my Sword.
4 4460 But why should Honor out-liue Honesty?
4 4461 Let it go all.
4 4462 Aemil. What did thy Song boad Lady?
4 4463 Hearke, canst thou heare me? I will play the Swan,
4 4464 And dye in Musicke: Willough, Willough, Willough.
4 4465 Moore, she was chaste: She lou'd thee, cruell Moore,
4 4466 So come my Soule to blisse, as I speake true:
4 4467 So speaking as I thinke, alas, I dye
4 4468 
4 4469    Oth. I haue another weapon in this Chamber,
4 4470 It was a Sword of Spaine, the Ice brookes temper:
4 4471 Oh heere it is: Vnkle I must come forth
4 4472 
4 4473    Gra. If thou attempt it, it will cost thee deere;
4 4474 Thou hast no weapon, and perforce must suffer
4 4475 
4 4476    Oth. Looke in vpon me then, and speake with me,
4 4477 Or naked as I am I will assault thee
4 4478 
4 4479    Gra. What is the matter?
4 4480   Othel. Behold, I haue a weapon:
4 4481 A better neuer did it selfe sustaine
4 4482 Vpon a Soldiers Thigh. I haue seene the day,
4 4483 That with this little Arme, and this good Sword,
4 4484 I haue made my way through more impediments
4 4485 Then twenty times your stop. But (oh vaine boast)
4 4486 Who can controll his Fate? 'Tis not so now.
4 4487 Be not affraid, though you do see me weapon'd:
4 4488 Heere is my iournies end, heere is my butt
4 4489 And verie Sea-marke of my vtmost Saile.
4 4490 Do you go backe dismaid? 'Tis a lost feare:
4 4491 Man but a Rush against Othello's brest,
4 4492 And he retires. Where should Othello go?
4 4493 Now: how dost thou looke now? Oh ill-Starr'd wench,
4 4494 Pale as thy Smocke: when we shall meete at compt,
4 4495 This looke of thine will hurle my Soule from Heauen,
4 4496 And Fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my Girle?
4 4497 Euen like thy Chastity. O cursed, cursed Slaue!
4 4498 Whip me ye Diuels,
4 4499 From the possession of this Heauenly sight:
4 4500 Blow me about in windes, roast me in Sulphure,
4 4501 Wash me in steepe-downe gulfes of Liquid fire.
4 4502 Oh Desdemon! dead Desdemon: dead. Oh, oh!
4 4503 Enter Lodouico, Cassio, Montano, and Iago, with Officers.
4 4504 
4 4505   Lod. Where is this rash, and most vnfortunate man?
4 4506   Oth. That's he that was Othello: heere I am
4 4507 
4 4508    Lod. Where is that Viper?
4 4509 Bring the Villaine forth
4 4510 
4 4511    Oth. I look down towards his feet; but that's a Fable,
4 4512 If that thou bee'st a Diuell, I cannot kill thee
4 4513 
4 4514    Lod. Wrench his Sword from him
4 4515 
4 4516    Iago. I bleed Sir, but not kill'd
4 4517 
4 4518    Othel. I am not sorry neither, Il'd haue thee liue:
4 4519 For in my sense, 'tis happinesse to die
4 4520 
4 4521    Lod. Oh thou Othello, that was once so good,
4 4522 Falne in the practise of a cursed Slaue,
4 4523 What shall be saide to thee
4 4524 
4 4525    Oth. Why any thing:
4 4526 An honourable Murderer, if you will:
4 4527 For nought I did in hate, but all in Honour
4 4528 
4 4529    Lod. This wretch hath part confest his Villany:
4 4530 Did you and he consent in Cassio's death
4 4531 
4 4532    Oth. I
4 4533 
4 4534    Cas. Deere Generall, I neuer gaue you cause
4 4535 
4 4536    Oth. I do beleeue it, and I aske your pardon:
4 4537 Will you, I pray, demand that demy-Diuell,
4 4538 Why he hath thus ensnar'd my Soule and Body
4 4539 
4 4540    Iag. Demand me nothing: what you know, you know:
4 4541 From this time forth, I neuer will speake word
4 4542 
4 4543    Lod. What? not to pray?
4 4544   Gra. Torments will ope your lips
4 4545 
4 4546    Oth. Well, thou dost best
4 4547 
4 4548    Lod. Sir,
4 4549 You shall vnderstand what hath befalne,
4 4550 (Which, as I thinke, you know not) heere is a Letter
4 4551 Found in the pocket of the slaine Rodorigo,
4 4552 And heere another, the one of them imports
4 4553 The death of Cassio, to be vndertooke
4 4554 By Rodorigo
4 4555 
4 4556    Oth. O Villaine!
4 4557   Cassio. Most Heathenish, and most grosse
4 4558 
4 4559    Lod. Now, heere's another discontented paper
4 4560 Found in his pocket too: and this it seemes
4 4561 Rodorigo meant t'haue sent this damned villaine:
4 4562 But that (belike) Iago in the interim
4 4563 Came in, and satisfi'd him
4 4564 
4 4565    Oth. Oh thou pernitious Caitiffe;
4 4566 How came you (Cassio) by that Handkerchiefe
4 4567 That was my wiues?
4 4568   Cassio. I found it in my Chamber:
4 4569 And he himselfe confest it but euen now,
4 4570 That there he dropt it for a speciall purpose,
4 4571 Which wrought to his desire
4 4572 
4 4573    Othel. O Foole, foole, foole!
4 4574   Cassio. There is besides, in Rodorigo's Letter,
4 4575 How he vpbraides Iago, that he made him
4 4576 Braue me vpon the Watch: whereon it came
4 4577 That I was cast: and euen but now he spake
4 4578 (After long seeming dead) Iago hurt him,
4 4579 Iago set him on
4 4580 
4 4581    Lod. You must forsake this roome, and go with vs:
4 4582 Your Power, and your Command is taken off,
4 4583 And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this Slaue,
4 4584 If there be any cunning Crueltie,
4 4585 That can torment him much, and hold him long,
4 4586 It shall be his. You shall close Prisoner rest,
4 4587 Till that the Nature of your fault be knowne
4 4588 To the Venetian State. Come, bring away
4 4589 
4 4590    Oth. Soft you; a word or two before you goe:
4 4591 I haue done the State some seruice, and they know't:
4 4592 No more of that. I pray you in your Letters,
4 4593 When you shall these vnluckie deeds relate,
4 4594 Speake of me, as I am. Nothing extenuate,
4 4595 Nor set downe ought in malice.
4 4596 Then must you speake,
4 4597 Of one that lou'd not wisely, but too well:
4 4598 Of one, not easily Iealious, but being wrought,
4 4599 Perplexed in the extreame: Of one, whose hand
4 4600 (Like the base Iudean) threw a Pearle away
4 4601 Richer then all his Tribe: Of one, whose subdu'd Eyes,
4 4602 Albeit vn-vsed to the melting moode,
4 4603 Drops teares as fast as the Arabian Trees
4 4604 Their Medicinable gumme. Set you downe this:
4 4605 And say besides, that in Aleppo once,
4 4606 Where a malignant, and a Turbond-Turke
4 4607 Beate a Venetian, and traduc'd the State,
4 4608 I tooke by th' throat the circumcised Dogge,
4 4609 And smoate him, thus
4 4610 
4 4611    Lod. Oh bloody period
4 4612 
4 4613    Gra. All that is spoke, is marr'd
4 4614 
4 4615    Oth. I kist thee, ere I kill'd thee: No way but this,
4 4616 Killing my selfe, to dye vpon a kisse.
4 4617 
4 4618 Dyes
4 4619 
4 4620   Cas. This did I feare, but thought he had no weapon:
4 4621 For he was great of heart
4 4622 
4 4623    Lod. Oh Sparton Dogge:
4 4624 More fell then Anguish, Hunger, or the Sea:
4 4625 Looke on the Tragicke Loading of this bed:
4 4626 This is thy worke:
4 4627 The Obiect poysons Sight,
4 4628 Let it be hid. Gratiano, keepe the house,
4 4629 And seize vpon the Fortunes of the Moore,
4 4630 For they succeede on you. To you, Lord Gouernor,
4 4631 Remaines the Censure of this hellish villaine:
4 4632 The Time, the Place, the Torture, oh inforce it:
4 4633 My selfe will straight aboord, and to the State,
4 4634 This heauie Act, with heauie heart relate.
4 4635 
4 4636 Exeunt.
