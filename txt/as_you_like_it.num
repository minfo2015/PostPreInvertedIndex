0 43 SCENE:
0 44 
0 45 OLIVER'S house; FREDERICK'S court; and the Forest of Arden
0 46 
0 47 
0 48 
0 49 
0 50 ACT I. SCENE I.
0 51 
0 52 Orchard of OLIVER'S house
0 53 
0 54 Enter ORLANDO and ADAM
0 55 
0 56 
0 57   ORLANDO. As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion bequeathed
0 58     me by will but poor a thousand crowns, and, as thou say'st,
0 59     charged my brother, on his blessing, to breed me well; and there
0 60     begins my sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and
0 61     report speaks goldenly of his profit. For my part, he keeps me
0 62     rustically at home, or, to speak more properly, stays me here at
0 63     home unkept; for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my
0 64     birth that differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses are
0 65     bred better; for, besides that they are fair with their feeding,
0 66     they are taught their manage, and to that end riders dearly
0 67     hir'd; but I, his brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for
0 68     the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him
0 69     as I. Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me, the
0 70     something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from
0 71     me. He lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a
0 72     brother, and as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my
0 73     education. This is it, Adam, that grieves me; and the spirit of
0 74     my father, which I think is within me, begins to mutiny against
0 75     this servitude. I will no longer endure it, though yet I know no
0 76     wise remedy how to avoid it.
0 77 
0 78                            Enter OLIVER
0 79 
0 80 
0 81   ADAM. Yonder comes my master, your brother.
0 82 
0 83   ORLANDO. Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will shake me
0 84     up.                                           [ADAM retires]
0 85 
0 86   OLIVER. Now, sir! what make you here?
0 87 
0 88   ORLANDO. Nothing; I am not taught to make any thing.
0 89 
0 90   OLIVER. What mar you then, sir?
0 91 
0 92   ORLANDO. Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God made, a
0 93     poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.
0 94 
0 95   OLIVER. Marry, sir, be better employed, and be nought awhile.
0 96 
0 97   ORLANDO. Shall I keep your hogs, and eat husks with them? What
0 98     prodigal portion have I spent that I should come to such penury?
0 99 
0 100   OLIVER. Know you where you are, sir?
0 101 
0 102   ORLANDO. O, sir, very well; here in your orchard.
0 103 
0 104   OLIVER. Know you before whom, sir?
0 105 
0 106   ORLANDO. Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know you are
0 107     my eldest brother; and in the gentle condition of blood, you
0 108     should so know me. The courtesy of nations allows you my better
0 109     in that you are the first-born; but the same tradition takes not
0 110     away my blood, were there twenty brothers betwixt us. I have as
0 111     much of my father in me as you, albeit I confess your coming
0 112     before me is nearer to his reverence.
0 113 
0 114   OLIVER. What, boy!                               [Strikes him]
0 115 
0 116   ORLANDO. Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.
0 117 
0 118   OLIVER. Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?
0 119 
0 120   ORLANDO. I am no villain; I am the youngest son of Sir Rowland de
0 121     Boys. He was my father; and he is thrice a villain that says such
0 122     a father begot villains. Wert thou not my brother, I would not
0 123     take this hand from thy throat till this other had pull'd out thy
0 124     tongue for saying so. Thou has rail'd on thyself.
0 125 
0 126   ADAM. [Coming forward] Sweet masters, be patient; for your father's
0 127     remembrance, be at accord.
0 128 
0 129   OLIVER. Let me go, I say.
0 130 
0 131   ORLANDO. I will not, till I please; you shall hear me. My father
0 132     charg'd you in his will to give me good education: you have
0 133     train'd me like a peasant, obscuring and hiding from me all
0 134     gentleman-like qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in
0 135     me, and I will no longer endure it; therefore allow me such
0 136     exercises as may become a gentleman, or give me the poor
0 137     allottery my father left me by testament; with that I will go buy
0 138     my fortunes.
0 139 
0 140   OLIVER. And what wilt thou do? Beg, when that is spent? Well, sir,
0 141     get you in. I will not long be troubled with you; you shall have
0 142     some part of your will. I pray you leave me.
0 143 
0 144   ORLANDO. I no further offend you than becomes me for my good.
0 145 
0 146   OLIVER. Get you with him, you old dog.
0 147 
0 148   ADAM. Is 'old dog' my reward? Most true, I have lost my teeth in
0 149     your service. God be with my old master! He would not have spoke
0 150     such a word.
0 151                                          Exeunt ORLANDO and ADAM
0 152 
0 153   OLIVER. Is it even so? Begin you to grow upon me? I will physic
0 154     your rankness, and yet give no thousand crowns neither.
0 155     Holla, Dennis!
0 156 
0 157                           Enter DENNIS
0 158 
0 159 
0 160   DENNIS. Calls your worship?
0 161 
0 162   OLIVER. not Charles, the Duke's wrestler, here to speak with me?
0 163 
0 164   DENNIS. So please you, he is here at the door and importunes access
0 165     to you.
0 166 
0 167   OLIVER. Call him in. [Exit DENNIS] 'Twill be a good way; and
0 168     to-morrow the wrestling is.
0 169 
0 170                           Enter CHARLES
0 171 
0 172 
0 173   CHARLES. Good morrow to your worship.
0 174 
0 175   OLIVER. Good Monsieur Charles! What's the new news at the new
0 176     court?
0 177 
0 178   CHARLES. There's no news at the court, sir, but the old news; that
0 179     is, the old Duke is banished by his younger brother the new Duke;
0 180     and three or four loving lords have put themselves into voluntary
0 181     exile with him, whose lands and revenues enrich the new Duke;
0 182     therefore he gives them good leave to wander.
0 183 
0 184   OLIVER. Can you tell if Rosalind, the Duke's daughter, be banished
0 185     with her father?
0 186 
0 187   CHARLES. O, no; for the Duke's daughter, her cousin, so loves her,
0 188     being ever from their cradles bred together, that she would have
0 189     followed her exile, or have died to stay behind her. She is at
0 190     the court, and no less beloved of her uncle than his own
0 191     daughter; and never two ladies loved as they do.
0 192 
0 193   OLIVER. Where will the old Duke live?
0 194 
0 195   CHARLES. They say he is already in the Forest of Arden, and a many
0 196     merry men with him; and there they live like the old Robin Hood
0 197     of England. They say many young gentlemen flock to him every day,
0 198     and fleet the time carelessly, as they did in the golden world.
0 199 
0 200   OLIVER. What, you wrestle to-morrow before the new Duke?
0 201 
0 202   CHARLES. Marry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a
0 203     matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand that your younger
0 204     brother, Orlando, hath a disposition to come in disguis'd against
0 205     me to try a fall. To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he
0 206     that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well.
0 207     Your brother is but young and tender; and, for your love, I would
0 208     be loath to foil him, as I must, for my own honour, if he come
0 209     in; therefore, out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint
0 210     you withal, that either you might stay him from his intendment,
0 211     or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into, in that it is
0 212     thing of his own search and altogether against my will.
0 213 
0 214   OLIVER. Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which thou shalt
0 215     find I will most kindly requite. I had myself notice of my
0 216     brother's purpose herein, and have by underhand means laboured to
0 217     dissuade him from it; but he is resolute. I'll tell thee,
0 218     Charles, it is the stubbornest young fellow of France; full of
0 219     ambition, an envious emulator of every man's good parts, a secret
0 220     and villainous contriver against me his natural brother.
0 221     Therefore use thy discretion: I had as lief thou didst break his
0 222     neck as his finger. And thou wert best look to't; for if thou
0 223     dost him any slight disgrace, or if he do not mightily grace
0 224     himself on thee, he will practise against thee by poison, entrap
0 225     thee by some treacherous device, and never leave thee till he
0 226     hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other; for, I
0 227     assure thee, and almost with tears I speak it, there is not one
0 228     so young and so villainous this day living. I speak but brotherly
0 229     of him; but should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must blush
0 230     and weep, and thou must look pale and wonder.
0 231 
0 232   CHARLES. I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come
0 233     to-morrow I'll give him his payment. If ever he go alone again,
0 234     I'll never wrestle for prize more. And so, God keep your worship!
0 235 
0 236  Exit
0 237 
0 238   OLIVER. Farewell, good Charles. Now will I stir this gamester.
0 239     I hope I shall see an end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why,
0 240     hates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle; never school'd and
0 241     yet learned; full of noble device; of all sorts enchantingly
0 242     beloved; and, indeed, so much in the heart of the world, and
0 243     especially of my own people, who best know him, that I am
0 244     altogether misprised. But it shall not be so long; this wrestler
0 245     shall clear all. Nothing remains but that I kindle the boy
0 246     thither, which now I'll go about.                       Exit

0 259 SCENE II.
0 260 
0 261 A lawn before the DUKE'S palace
0 262 
0 263 Enter ROSALIND and CELIA
0 264 
0 265 
0 266   CELIA. I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.
0 267 
0 268   ROSALIND. Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of; and
0 269     would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could teach me to forget
0 270     a banished father, you must not learn me how to remember any
0 271     extraordinary pleasure.
0 272 
0 273   CELIA. Herein I see thou lov'st me not with the full weight that I
0 274     love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father, had banished thy
0 275     uncle, the Duke my father, so thou hadst been still with me,
0 276     I could have taught my love to take thy father for mine; so wouldst
0 277     thou, if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously temper'd
0 278     as mine is to thee.
0 279 
0 280   ROSALIND. Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to
0 281     rejoice in yours.
0 282 
0 283   CELIA. You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is like to
0 284     have; and, truly, when he dies thou shalt be his heir; for what
0 285     he hath taken away from thy father perforce, I will render thee
0 286     again in affection. By mine honour, I will; and when I break that
0 287     oath, let me turn monster; therefore, my sweet Rose, my dear
0 288     Rose, be merry.
0 289 
0 290   ROSALIND. From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports.
0 291     Let me see; what think you of falling in love?
0 292 
0 293   CELIA. Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal; but love no man
0 294     in good earnest, nor no further in sport neither than with safety
0 295     of a pure blush thou mayst in honour come off again.
0 296 
0 297   ROSALIND. What shall be our sport, then?
0 298 
0 299   CELIA. Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from her
0 300     wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.
0 301 
0 302   ROSALIND. I would we could do so; for her benefits are mightily
0 303     misplaced; and the bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her
0 304     gifts to women.
0 305 
0 306   CELIA. 'Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce makes
0 307     honest; and those that she makes honest she makes very
0 308     ill-favouredly.
0 309 
0 310   ROSALIND. Nay; now thou goest from Fortune's office to Nature's:
0 311     Fortune reigns in gifts of the world, not in the lineaments of
0 312     Nature.
0 313 
0 314                          Enter TOUCHSTONE
0 315 
0 316 
0 317   CELIA. No; when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she not by
0 318     Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature hath given us wit to
0 319     flout at Fortune, hath not Fortune sent in this fool to cut off
0 320     the argument?
0 321 
0 322   ROSALIND. Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when
0 323     Fortune makes Nature's natural the cutter-off of Nature's wit.
0 324 
0 325   CELIA. Peradventure this is not Fortune's work neither, but
0 326     Nature's, who perceiveth our natural wits too dull to reason of
0 327     such goddesses, and hath sent this natural for our whetstone; for
0 328     always the dullness of the fool is the whetstone of the wits.
0 329     How now, wit! Whither wander you?
0 330 
0 331   TOUCHSTONE. Mistress, you must come away to your father.
0 332 
0 333   CELIA. Were you made the messenger?
0 334 
0 335   TOUCHSTONE. No, by mine honour; but I was bid to come for you.
0 336 
0 337   ROSALIND. Where learned you that oath, fool?
0 338 
0 339   TOUCHSTONE. Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they were
0 340     good pancakes, and swore by his honour the mustard was naught.
0 341     Now I'll stand to it, the pancakes were naught and the mustard
0 342     was good, and yet was not the knight forsworn.
0 343 
0 344   CELIA. How prove you that, in the great heap of your knowledge?
0 345 
0 346   ROSALIND. Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.
0 347 
0 348   TOUCHSTONE. Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and swear
0 349     by your beards that I am a knave.
0 350 
0 351   CELIA. By our beards, if we had them, thou art.
0 352 
0 353   TOUCHSTONE. By my knavery, if I had it, then I were. But if you
0 354     swear by that that not, you are not forsworn; no more was this
0 355     knight, swearing by his honour, for he never had any; or if he
0 356     had, he had sworn it away before ever he saw those pancackes or
0 357     that mustard.
0 358 
0 359   CELIA. Prithee, who is't that thou mean'st?
0 360 
0 361   TOUCHSTONE. One that old Frederick, your father, loves.
0 362 
0 363   CELIA. My father's love is enough to honour him. Enough, speak no
0 364     more of him; you'll be whipt for taxation one of these days.
0 365 
0 366   TOUCHSTONE. The more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise
0 367     men do foolishly.
0 368 
0 369   CELIA. By my troth, thou sayest true; for since the little wit that
0 370     fools have was silenced, the little foolery that wise men have
0 371     makes a great show. Here comes Monsieur Le Beau.
0 372 
0 373                            Enter LE BEAU
0 374 
0 375 
0 376   ROSALIND. With his mouth full of news.
0 377 
0 378   CELIA. Which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young.
0 379 
0 380   ROSALIND. Then shall we be news-cramm'd.
0 381 
0 382   CELIA. All the better; we shall be the more marketable. Bon jour,
0 383     Monsieur Le Beau. What's the news?
0 384 
0 385   LE BEAU. Fair Princess, you have lost much good sport.
0 386 
0 387   CELIA. Sport! of what colour?
0 388 
0 389   LE BEAU. What colour, madam? How shall I answer you?
0 390 
0 391   ROSALIND. As wit and fortune will.
0 392 
0 393   TOUCHSTONE. Or as the Destinies decrees.
0 394 
0 395   CELIA. Well said; that was laid on with a trowel.
0 396 
0 397   TOUCHSTONE. Nay, if I keep not my rank-
0 398 
0 399   ROSALIND. Thou losest thy old smell.
0 400 
0 401   LE BEAU. You amaze me, ladies. I would have told you of good
0 402     wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.
0 403 
0 404   ROSALIND. Yet tell us the manner of the wrestling.
0 405 
0 406   LE BEAU. I will tell you the beginning, and, if it please your
0 407     ladyships, you may see the end; for the best is yet to do; and
0 408     here, where you are, they are coming to perform it.
0 409 
0 410   CELIA. Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried.
0 411 
0 412   LE BEAU. There comes an old man and his three sons-
0 413 
0 414   CELIA. I could match this beginning with an old tale.
0 415 
0 416   LE BEAU. Three proper young men, of excellent growth and presence.
0 417 
0 418   ROSALIND. With bills on their necks: 'Be it known unto all men by
0 419     these presents'-
0 420 
0 421   LE BEAU. The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the Duke's
0 422     wrestler; which Charles in a moment threw him, and broke three of
0 423     his ribs, that there is little hope of life in him. So he serv'd
0 424     the second, and so the third. Yonder they lie; the poor old man,
0 425     their father, making such pitiful dole over them that all the
0 426     beholders take his part with weeping.
0 427 
0 428   ROSALIND. Alas!
0 429 
0 430   TOUCHSTONE. But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies have
0 431     lost?
0 432 
0 433   LE BEAU. Why, this that I speak of.
0 434 
0 435   TOUCHSTONE. Thus men may grow wiser every day. It is the first time
0 436     that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladies.
0 437 
0 438   CELIA. Or I, I promise thee.
0 439 
0 440   ROSALIND. But is there any else longs to see this broken music in
0 441     his sides? Is there yet another dotes upon rib-breaking?
0 442     Shall we see this wrestling, cousin?
0 443 
0 444   LE BEAU. You must, if you stay here; for here is the place
0 445     appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to perform it.
0 446 
0 447   CELIA. Yonder, sure, they are coming. Let us now stay and see it.
0 448 
0 449            Flourish. Enter DUKE FREDERICK, LORDS, ORLANDO,
0 450                      CHARLES, and ATTENDANTS
0 451 
0 452 
0 453   FREDERICK. Come on; since the youth will not be entreated, his own
0 454     peril on his forwardness.
0 455 
0 456   ROSALIND. Is yonder the man?
0 457 
0 458   LE BEAU. Even he, madam.
0 459 
0 460   CELIA. Alas, he is too young; yet he looks successfully.
0 461 
0 462   FREDERICK. How now, daughter and cousin! Are you crept hither to
0 463     see the wrestling?
0 464 
0 465   ROSALIND. Ay, my liege; so please you give us leave.
0 466 
0 467   FREDERICK. You will take little delight in it, I can tell you,
0 468 
0 469     there is such odds in the man. In pity of the challenger's youth
0 470     I would fain dissuade him, but he will not be entreated.
0 471     Speak to him, ladies; see if you can move him.
0 472 
0 473   CELIA. Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.
0 474 
0 475   FREDERICK. Do so; I'll not be by.
0 476                                      [DUKE FREDERICK goes apart]
0 477 
0 478   LE BEAU. Monsieur the Challenger, the Princess calls for you.
0 479 
0 480   ORLANDO. I attend them with all respect and duty.
0 481 
0 482   ROSALIND. Young man, have you challeng'd Charles the wrestler?
0 483 
0 484   ORLANDO. No, fair Princess; he is the general challenger. I come
0 485     but in, as others do, to try with him the strength of my youth.
0 486 
0 487   CELIA. Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your years.
0 488     You have seen cruel proof of this man's strength; if you saw
0 489     yourself with your eyes, or knew yourself with your judgment, the
0 490     fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal
0 491     enterprise. We pray you, for your own sake, to embrace your own
0 492     safety and give over this attempt.
0 493 
0 494   ROSALIND. Do, young sir; your reputation shall not therefore be
0 495     misprised: we will make it our suit to the Duke that the
0 496     wrestling might not go forward.
0 497 
0 498   ORLANDO. I beseech you, punish me not with your hard thoughts,
0 499     wherein I confess me much guilty to deny so fair and excellent
0 500     ladies any thing. But let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go
0 501     with me to my trial; wherein if I be foil'd there is but one
0 502     sham'd that was never gracious; if kill'd, but one dead that is
0 503     willing to be so. I shall do my friends no wrong, for I have none
0 504     to lament me; the world no injury, for in it I have nothing; only
0 505     in the world I fill up a place, which may be better supplied when
0 506     I have made it empty.
0 507 
0 508   ROSALIND. The little strength that I have, I would it were with
0 509     you.
0 510 
0 511   CELIA. And mine to eke out hers.
0 512 
0 513   ROSALIND. Fare you well. Pray heaven I be deceiv'd in you!
0 514 
0 515   CELIA. Your heart's desires be with you!
0 516 
0 517   CHARLES. Come, where is this young gallant that is so desirous to
0 518     lie with his mother earth?
0 519 
0 520   ORLANDO. Ready, sir; but his will hath in it a more modest working.
0 521 
0 522   FREDERICK. You shall try but one fall.
0 523 
0 524   CHARLES. No, I warrant your Grace, you shall not entreat him to a
0 525     second, that have so mightily persuaded him from a first.
0 526 
0 527   ORLANDO. You mean to mock me after; you should not have mock'd me
0 528     before; but come your ways.
0 529 
0 530   ROSALIND. Now, Hercules be thy speed, young man!
0 531 
0 532   CELIA. I would I were invisible, to catch the strong fellow by the
0 533     leg.                                          [They wrestle]
0 534 
0 535   ROSALIND. O excellent young man!
0 536 
0 537   CELIA. If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell who should
0 538     down.
0 539                                       [CHARLES is thrown. Shout]
0 540 
0 541   FREDERICK. No more, no more.
0 542 
0 543   ORLANDO. Yes, I beseech your Grace; I am not yet well breath'd.
0 544 
0 545   FREDERICK. How dost thou, Charles?
0 546 
0 547   LE BEAU. He cannot speak, my lord.
0 548 
0 549   FREDERICK. Bear him away. What is thy name, young man?
0 550 
0 551   ORLANDO. Orlando, my liege; the youngest son of Sir Rowland de
0 552     Boys.
0 553 
0 554   FREDERICK. I would thou hadst been son to some man else.
0 555     The world esteem'd thy father honourable,
0 556     But I did find him still mine enemy.
0 557     Thou shouldst have better pleas'd me with this deed,
0 558     Hadst thou descended from another house.
0 559     But fare thee well; thou art a gallant youth;
0 560     I would thou hadst told me of another father.
0 561                                  Exeunt DUKE, train, and LE BEAU
0 562 
0 563   CELIA. Were I my father, coz, would I do this?
0 564 
0 565   ORLANDO. I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son,
0 566     His youngest son- and would not change that calling
0 567     To be adopted heir to Frederick.
0 568 
0 569   ROSALIND. My father lov'd Sir Rowland as his soul,
0 570     And all the world was of my father's mind;
0 571     Had I before known this young man his son,
0 572     I should have given him tears unto entreaties
0 573     Ere he should thus have ventur'd.
0 574 
0 575   CELIA. Gentle cousin,
0 576     Let us go thank him, and encourage him;
0 577     My father's rough and envious disposition
0 578     Sticks me at heart. Sir, you have well deserv'd;
0 579     If you do keep your promises in love
0 580     But justly as you have exceeded all promise,
0 581     Your mistress shall be happy.
0 582 
0 583   ROSALIND. Gentleman,        [Giving him a chain from her neck]
0 584     Wear this for me; one out of suits with fortune,
0 585     That could give more, but that her hand lacks means.
0 586     Shall we go, coz?
0 587 
0 588   CELIA. Ay. Fare you well, fair gentleman.
0 589 
0 590   ORLANDO. Can I not say 'I thank you'? My better parts
0 591     Are all thrown down; and that which here stands up
0 592     Is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block.
0 593 
0 594   ROSALIND. He calls us back. My pride fell with my fortunes;
0 595     I'll ask him what he would. Did you call, sir?
0 596     Sir, you have wrestled well, and overthrown
0 597     More than your enemies.
0 598 
0 599   CELIA. Will you go, coz?
0 600 
0 601   ROSALIND. Have with you. Fare you well.
0 602                                        Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA
0 603 
0 604   ORLANDO. What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?
0 605     I cannot speak to her, yet she urg'd conference.
0 606     O poor Orlando, thou art overthrown!
0 607     Or Charles or something weaker masters thee.
0 608 
0 609                       Re-enter LE BEAU
0 610 
0 611 
0 612   LE BEAU. Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you
0 613     To leave this place. Albeit you have deserv'd
0 614     High commendation, true applause, and love,
0 615     Yet such is now the Duke's condition
0 616     That he misconstrues all that you have done.
0 617     The Duke is humorous; what he is, indeed,
0 618     More suits you to conceive than I to speak of.
0 619 
0 620   ORLANDO. I thank you, sir; and pray you tell me this:
0 621     Which of the two was daughter of the Duke
0 622     That here was at the wrestling?
0 623 
0 624   LE BEAU. Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners;
0 625     But yet, indeed, the smaller is his daughter;
0 626     The other is daughter to the banish'd Duke,
0 627     And here detain'd by her usurping uncle,
0 628     To keep his daughter company; whose loves
0 629     Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters.
0 630     But I can tell you that of late this Duke
0 631     Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece,
0 632     Grounded upon no other argument
0 633     But that the people praise her for her virtues
0 634     And pity her for her good father's sake;
0 635     And, on my life, his malice 'gainst the lady
0 636     Will suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well.
0 637     Hereafter, in a better world than this,
0 638     I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.
0 639 
0 640   ORLANDO. I rest much bounden to you; fare you well.
0 641                                                     Exit LE BEAU
0 642     Thus must I from the smoke into the smother;
0 643     From tyrant Duke unto a tyrant brother.
0 644     But heavenly Rosalind!                                  Exit
0 645 
0 646 
0 647 SCENE III.
0 648 
0 649 The DUKE's palace
0 650 
0 651 Enter CELIA and ROSALIND
0 652 
0 653 
0 654   CELIA. Why, cousin! why, Rosalind! Cupid have mercy!
0 655     Not a word?
0 656 
0 657   ROSALIND. Not one to throw at a dog.
0 658 
0 659   CELIA. No, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon curs;
0 660     throw some of them at me; come, lame me with reasons.
0 661 
0 662   ROSALIND. Then there were two cousins laid up, when the one should
0 663     be lam'd with reasons and the other mad without any.
0 664 
0 665   CELIA. But is all this for your father?
0 666 
0 667   ROSALIND. No, some of it is for my child's father. O, how full of
0 668     briers is this working-day world!
0 669 
0 670   CELIA. They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in holiday
0 671     foolery; if we walk not in the trodden paths, our very petticoats
0 672     will catch them.
0 673 
0 674   ROSALIND. I could shake them off my coat: these burs are in my
0 675     heart.
0 676 
0 677   CELIA. Hem them away.
0 678 
0 679   ROSALIND. I would try, if I could cry 'hem' and have him.
0 680 
0 681   CELIA. Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.
0 682 
0 683   ROSALIND. O, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself.
0 684 
0 685   CELIA. O, a good wish upon you! You will try in time, in despite of
0 686     a fall. But, turning these jests out of service, let us talk in
0 687     good earnest. Is it possible, on such a sudden, you should fall
0 688     into so strong a liking with old Sir Rowland's youngest son?
0 689 
0 690   ROSALIND. The Duke my father lov'd his father dearly.
0 691 
0 692   CELIA. Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly?
0 693     By this kind of chase I should hate him, for my father hated his
0 694     father dearly; yet I hate not Orlando.
0 695 
0 696   ROSALIND. No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.
0 697 
0 698   CELIA. Why should I not? Doth he not deserve well?
0 699 
0 700                     Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with LORDS
0 701 
0 702 
0 703   ROSALIND. Let me love him for that; and do you love him because I
0 704     do. Look, here comes the Duke.
0 705 
0 706   CELIA. With his eyes full of anger.
0 707 
0 708   FREDERICK. Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste,
0 709     And get you from our court.
0 710 
0 711   ROSALIND. Me, uncle?
0 712 
0 713   FREDERICK. You, cousin.
0 714     Within these ten days if that thou beest found
0 715     So near our public court as twenty miles,
0 716     Thou diest for it.
0 717 
0 718   ROSALIND. I do beseech your Grace,
0 719     Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me.
0 720     If with myself I hold intelligence,
0 721     Or have acquaintance with mine own desires;
0 722     If that I do not dream, or be not frantic-
0 723     As I do trust I am not- then, dear uncle,
0 724     Never so much as in a thought unborn
0 725     Did I offend your Highness.
0 726 
0 727   FREDERICK. Thus do all traitors;
0 728     If their purgation did consist in words,
0 729     They are as innocent as grace itself.
0 730     Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.
0 731 
0 732   ROSALIND. Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor.
0 733     Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.
0 734 
0 735   FREDERICK. Thou art thy father's daughter; there's enough.
0 736 
0 737   ROSALIND. SO was I when your Highness took his dukedom;
0 738     So was I when your Highness banish'd him.
0 739     Treason is not inherited, my lord;
0 740     Or, if we did derive it from our friends,
0 741     What's that to me? My father was no traitor.
0 742     Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much
0 743     To think my poverty is treacherous.
0 744 
0 745   CELIA. Dear sovereign, hear me speak.
0 746 
0 747   FREDERICK. Ay, Celia; we stay'd her for your sake,
0 748     Else had she with her father rang'd along.
0 749 
0 750   CELIA. I did not then entreat to have her stay;
0 751     It was your pleasure, and your own remorse;
0 752     I was too young that time to value her,
0 753     But now I know her. If she be a traitor,
0 754     Why so am I: we still have slept together,
0 755     Rose at an instant, learn'd, play'd, eat together;
0 756     And wheresoe'er we went, like Juno's swans,
0 757     Still we went coupled and inseparable.
0 758 
0 759   FREDERICK. She is too subtle for thee; and her smoothness,
0 760     Her very silence and her patience,
0 761     Speak to the people, and they pity her.
0 762     Thou art a fool. She robs thee of thy name;
0 763     And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous
0 764     When she is gone. Then open not thy lips.
0 765     Firm and irrevocable is my doom
0 766     Which I have pass'd upon her; she is banish'd.
0 767 
0 768   CELIA. Pronounce that sentence, then, on me, my liege;
0 769     I cannot live out of her company.
0 770 
0 771   FREDERICK. You are a fool. You, niece, provide yourself.
0 772     If you outstay the time, upon mine honour,
0 773     And in the greatness of my word, you die.
0 774                                            Exeunt DUKE and LORDS
0 775 
0 776   CELIA. O my poor Rosalind! Whither wilt thou go?
0 777     Wilt thou change fathers? I will give thee mine.
0 778     I charge thee be not thou more griev'd than I am.
0 779 
0 780   ROSALIND. I have more cause.
0 781 
0 782   CELIA. Thou hast not, cousin.
0 783     Prithee be cheerful. Know'st thou not the Duke
0 784     Hath banish'd me, his daughter?
0 785 
0 786   ROSALIND. That he hath not.
0 787 
0 788   CELIA. No, hath not? Rosalind lacks, then, the love
0 789     Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one.
0 790     Shall we be sund'red? Shall we part, sweet girl?
0 791     No; let my father seek another heir.
0 792     Therefore devise with me how we may fly,
0 793     Whither to go, and what to bear with us;
0 794     And do not seek to take your charge upon you,
0 795     To bear your griefs yourself, and leave me out;
0 796     For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,
0 797     Say what thou canst, I'll go along with thee.
0 798 
0 799   ROSALIND. Why, whither shall we go?
0 800 
0 801   CELIA. To seek my uncle in the Forest of Arden.
0 802 
0 803   ROSALIND. Alas, what danger will it be to us,
0 804     Maids as we are, to travel forth so far!
0 805     Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.
0 806 
0 807   CELIA. I'll put myself in poor and mean attire,
0 808     And with a kind of umber smirch my face;
0 809     The like do you; so shall we pass along,
0 810     And never stir assailants.
0 811 
0 812   ROSALIND. Were it not better,
0 813     Because that I am more than common tall,
0 814     That I did suit me all points like a man?
0 815     A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,
0 816     A boar spear in my hand; and- in my heart
0 817     Lie there what hidden woman's fear there will-
0 818     We'll have a swashing and a martial outside,
0 819     As many other mannish cowards have
0 820     That do outface it with their semblances.
0 821 
0 822   CELIA. What shall I call thee when thou art a man?
0 823 
0 824   ROSALIND. I'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page,
0 825     And therefore look you call me Ganymede.
0 826     But what will you be call'd?
0 827 
0 828   CELIA. Something that hath a reference to my state:
0 829     No longer Celia, but Aliena.
0 830 
0 831   ROSALIND. But, cousin, what if we assay'd to steal
0 832     The clownish fool out of your father's court?
0 833     Would he not be a comfort to our travel?
0 834 
0 835   CELIA. He'll go along o'er the wide world with me;
0 836     Leave me alone to woo him. Let's away,
0 837     And get our jewels and our wealth together;
0 838     Devise the fittest time and safest way
0 839     To hide us from pursuit that will be made
0 840     After my flight. Now go we in content
0 841     To liberty, and not to banishment.                    Exeunt

0 857 
0 858 The Forest of Arden
0 859 
0 860 Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and two or three LORDS, like foresters
0 861 
0 862 
0 863   DUKE SENIOR. Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile,
0 864     Hath not old custom made this life more sweet
0 865     Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods
0 866     More free from peril than the envious court?
0 867     Here feel we not the penalty of Adam,
0 868     The seasons' difference; as the icy fang
0 869     And churlish chiding of the winter's wind,
0 870     Which when it bites and blows upon my body,
0 871     Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say
0 872     'This is no flattery; these are counsellors
0 873     That feelingly persuade me what I am.'
0 874     Sweet are the uses of adversity,
0 875     Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,
0 876     Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;
0 877     And this our life, exempt from public haunt,
0 878     Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
0 879     Sermons in stones, and good in everything.
0 880     I would not change it.
0 881 
0 882   AMIENS. Happy is your Grace,
0 883     That can translate the stubbornness of fortune
0 884     Into so quiet and so sweet a style.
0 885 
0 886   DUKE SENIOR. Come, shall we go and kill us venison?
0 887     And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,
0 888     Being native burghers of this desert city,
0 889     Should, in their own confines, with forked heads
0 890     Have their round haunches gor'd.
0 891 
0 892   FIRST LORD. Indeed, my lord,
0 893     The melancholy Jaques grieves at that;
0 894     And, in that kind, swears you do more usurp
0 895     Than doth your brother that hath banish'd you.
0 896     To-day my Lord of Amiens and myself
0 897     Did steal behind him as he lay along
0 898     Under an oak whose antique root peeps out
0 899     Upon the brook that brawls along this wood!
0 900     To the which place a poor sequest'red stag,
0 901     That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt,
0 902     Did come to languish; and, indeed, my lord,
0 903     The wretched animal heav'd forth such groans
0 904     That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat
0 905     Almost to bursting; and the big round tears
0 906     Cours'd one another down his innocent nose
0 907     In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool,
0 908     Much marked of the melancholy Jaques,
0 909     Stood on th' extremest verge of the swift brook,
0 910     Augmenting it with tears.
0 911 
0 912   DUKE SENIOR. But what said Jaques?
0 913     Did he not moralize this spectacle?
0 914 
0 915   FIRST LORD. O, yes, into a thousand similes.
0 916     First, for his weeping into the needless stream:
0 917     'Poor deer,' quoth he 'thou mak'st a testament
0 918     As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more
0 919     To that which had too much.' Then, being there alone,
0 920     Left and abandoned of his velvet friends:
0 921     ''Tis right'; quoth he 'thus misery doth part
0 922     The flux of company.' Anon, a careless herd,
0 923     Full of the pasture, jumps along by him
0 924     And never stays to greet him. 'Ay,' quoth Jaques
0 925     'Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens;
0 926     'Tis just the fashion. Wherefore do you look
0 927     Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?'
0 928     Thus most invectively he pierceth through
0 929     The body of the country, city, court,
0 930     Yea, and of this our life; swearing that we
0 931     Are mere usurpers, tyrants, and what's worse,
0 932     To fright the animals, and to kill them up
0 933     In their assign'd and native dwelling-place.
0 934 
0 935   DUKE SENIOR. And did you leave him in this contemplation?
0 936 
0 937   SECOND LORD. We did, my lord, weeping and commenting
0 938     Upon the sobbing deer.
0 939 
0 940   DUKE SENIOR. Show me the place;
0 941     I love to cope him in these sullen fits,
0 942     For then he's full of matter.
0 943 
0 944   FIRST LORD. I'll bring you to him straight.             Exeunt
0 945 
0 946 
0 947 SCENE II.
0 948 
0 949 The DUKE'S palace
0 950 
0 951 Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with LORDS
0 952 
0 953 
0 954   FREDERICK. Can it be possible that no man saw them?
0 955     It cannot be; some villains of my court
0 956     Are of consent and sufferance in this.
0 957 
0 958   FIRST LORD. I cannot hear of any that did see her.
0 959     The ladies, her attendants of her chamber,
0 960     Saw her abed, and in the morning early
0 961     They found the bed untreasur'd of their mistress.
0 962 
0 963   SECOND LORD. My lord, the roynish clown, at whom so oft
0 964     Your Grace was wont to laugh, is also missing.
0 965     Hisperia, the Princess' gentlewoman,
0 966     Confesses that she secretly o'erheard
0 967     Your daughter and her cousin much commend
0 968     The parts and graces of the wrestler
0 969     That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles;
0 970     And she believes, wherever they are gone,
0 971     That youth is surely in their company.
0 972 
0 973   FREDERICK. Send to his brother; fetch that gallant hither.
0 974     If he be absent, bring his brother to me;
0 975     I'll make him find him. Do this suddenly;
0 976     And let not search and inquisition quail
0 977     To bring again these foolish runaways.                Exeunt
0 978 
0 979 
0 980 SCENE III.
0 981 
0 982 Before OLIVER'S house
0 983 
0 984 Enter ORLANDO and ADAM, meeting
0 985 
0 986 
0 987   ORLANDO. Who's there?
0 988 
0 989   ADAM. What, my young master? O my gentle master!
0 990     O my sweet master! O you memory
0 991     Of old Sir Rowland! Why, what make you here?
0 992     Why are you virtuous? Why do people love you?
0 993     And wherefore are you gentle, strong, and valiant?
0 994     Why would you be so fond to overcome
0 995     The bonny prizer of the humorous Duke?
0 996     Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.
0 997     Know you not, master, to some kind of men
0 998     Their graces serve them but as enemies?
0 999     No more do yours. Your virtues, gentle master,
0 1000     Are sanctified and holy traitors to you.
0 1001     O, what a world is this, when what is comely
0 1002     Envenoms him that bears it!
0 1003 
0 1004   ORLANDO. Why, what's the matter?
0 1005 
0 1006   ADAM. O unhappy youth!
0 1007     Come not within these doors; within this roof
0 1008     The enemy of all your graces lives.
0 1009     Your brother- no, no brother; yet the son-
0 1010     Yet not the son; I will not call him son
0 1011     Of him I was about to call his father-
0 1012     Hath heard your praises; and this night he means
0 1013     To burn the lodging where you use to lie,
0 1014     And you within it. If he fail of that,
0 1015     He will have other means to cut you off;
0 1016     I overheard him and his practices.
0 1017     This is no place; this house is but a butchery;
0 1018     Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.
0 1019 
0 1020   ORLANDO. Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?
0 1021 
0 1022   ADAM. No matter whither, so you come not here.
0 1023 
0 1024   ORLANDO. What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food,
0 1025     Or with a base and boist'rous sword enforce
0 1026     A thievish living on the common road?
0 1027     This I must do, or know not what to do;
0 1028     Yet this I will not do, do how I can.
0 1029     I rather will subject me to the malice
0 1030     Of a diverted blood and bloody brother.
0 1031 
0 1032   ADAM. But do not so. I have five hundred crowns,
0 1033     The thrifty hire I sav'd under your father,
0 1034     Which I did store to be my foster-nurse,
0 1035     When service should in my old limbs lie lame,
0 1036     And unregarded age in corners thrown.
0 1037     Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,
0 1038     Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,
0 1039     Be comfort to my age! Here is the gold;
0 1040     All this I give you. Let me be your servant;
0 1041     Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty;
0 1042     For in my youth I never did apply
0 1043     Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,
0 1044     Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo
0 1045     The means of weakness and debility;
0 1046     Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,
0 1047     Frosty, but kindly. Let me go with you;
0 1048     I'll do the service of a younger man
0 1049     In all your business and necessities.
0 1050 
0 1051   ORLANDO. O good old man, how well in thee appears
0 1052     The constant service of the antique world,
0 1053     When service sweat for duty, not for meed!
0 1054     Thou art not for the fashion of these times,
0 1055     Where none will sweat but for promotion,
0 1056     And having that do choke their service up
0 1057     Even with the having; it is not so with thee.
0 1058     But, poor old man, thou prun'st a rotten tree
0 1059     That cannot so much as a blossom yield
0 1060     In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry.
0 1061     But come thy ways, we'll go along together,
0 1062     And ere we have thy youthful wages spent
0 1063     We'll light upon some settled low content.
0 1064 
0 1065   ADAM. Master, go on; and I will follow the
0 1066     To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty.
0 1067     From seventeen years till now almost four-score
0 1068     Here lived I, but now live here no more.
0 1069     At seventeen years many their fortunes seek,
0 1070     But at fourscore it is too late a week;
0 1071     Yet fortune cannot recompense me better
0 1072     Than to die well and not my master's debtor.          Exeunt
0 1073 
0 1074 
0 1075 SCENE IV.
0 1076 
0 1077 The Forest of Arden
0 1078 
0 1079 Enter ROSALIND for GANYMEDE, CELIA for ALIENA, and CLOWN alias TOUCHSTONE
0 1080 
0 1081 
0 1082   ROSALIND. O Jupiter, how weary are my spirits!
0 1083 
0 1084   TOUCHSTONE. I Care not for my spirits, if my legs were not weary.
0 1085 
0 1086   ROSALIND. I could find in my heart to disgrace my man's apparel,
0 1087     and to cry like a woman; but I must comfort the weaker vessel, as
0 1088     doublet and hose ought to show itself courageous to petticoat;
0 1089     therefore, courage, good Aliena.
0 1090 
0 1091   CELIA. I pray you bear with me; I cannot go no further.
0 1092 
0 1093   TOUCHSTONE. For my part, I had rather bear with you than bear you;
0 1094     yet I should bear no cross if I did bear you; for I think you
0 1095     have no money in your purse.
0 1096 
0 1097   ROSALIND. Well,. this is the Forest of Arden.
0 1098 
0 1099   TOUCHSTONE. Ay, now am I in Arden; the more fool I; when I was at
0 1100     home I was in a better place; but travellers must be content.
0 1101 
0 1102                         Enter CORIN and SILVIUS
0 1103 
0 1104 
0 1105   ROSALIND. Ay, be so, good Touchstone. Look you, who comes here, a
0 1106     young man and an old in solemn talk.
0 1107 
0 1108   CORIN. That is the way to make her scorn you still.
0 1109 
0 1110   SILVIUS. O Corin, that thou knew'st how I do love her!
0 1111 
0 1112   CORIN. I partly guess; for I have lov'd ere now.
0 1113 
0 1114   SILVIUS. No, Corin, being old, thou canst not guess,
0 1115     Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover
0 1116     As ever sigh'd upon a midnight pillow.
0 1117     But if thy love were ever like to mine,
0 1118     As sure I think did never man love so,
0 1119     How many actions most ridiculous
0 1120     Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?
0 1121 
0 1122   CORIN. Into a thousand that I have forgotten.
0 1123 
0 1124   SILVIUS. O, thou didst then never love so heartily!
0 1125     If thou rememb'rest not the slightest folly
0 1126     That ever love did make thee run into,
0 1127     Thou hast not lov'd;
0 1128     Or if thou hast not sat as I do now,
0 1129     Wearing thy hearer in thy mistress' praise,
0 1130     Thou hast not lov'd;
0 1131     Or if thou hast not broke from company
0 1132     Abruptly, as my passion now makes me,
0 1133     Thou hast not lov'd.
0 1134     O Phebe, Phebe, Phebe!                          Exit Silvius
0 1135 
0 1136   ROSALIND. Alas, poor shepherd! searching of thy wound,
0 1137     I have by hard adventure found mine own.
0 1138 
0 1139   TOUCHSTONE. And I mine. I remember, when I was in love, I broke my
0 1140     sword upon a stone, and bid him take that for coming a-night to
0 1141     Jane Smile; and I remember the kissing of her batler, and the
0 1142     cow's dugs that her pretty chopt hands had milk'd; and I remember
0 1143     the wooing of peascod instead of her; from whom I took two cods,
0 1144     and giving her them again, said with weeping tears 'Wear these
0 1145     for my sake.' We that are true lovers run into strange capers;
0 1146     but as all is mortal in nature, so is all nature in love mortal
0 1147     in folly.
0 1148 
0 1149   ROSALIND. Thou speak'st wiser than thou art ware of.
0 1150 
0 1151   TOUCHSTONE. Nay, I shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till I break
0 1152     my shins against it.
0 1153 
0 1154   ROSALIND. Jove, Jove! this shepherd's passion
0 1155     Is much upon my fashion.
0 1156 
0 1157   TOUCHSTONE. And mine; but it grows something stale with me.
0 1158 
0 1159   CELIA. I pray you, one of you question yond man
0 1160     If he for gold will give us any food;
0 1161     I faint almost to death.
0 1162 
0 1163   TOUCHSTONE. Holla, you clown!
0 1164 
0 1165   ROSALIND. Peace, fool; he's not thy Ensman.
0 1166 
0 1167   CORIN. Who calls?
0 1168 
0 1169   TOUCHSTONE. Your betters, sir.
0 1170 
0 1171   CORIN. Else are they very wretched.
0 1172 
0 1173   ROSALIND. Peace, I say. Good even to you, friend.
0 1174 
0 1175   CORIN. And to you, gentle sir, and to you all.
0 1176 
0 1177   ROSALIND. I prithee, shepherd, if that love or gold
0 1178     Can in this desert place buy entertainment,
0 1179     Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed.
0 1180     Here's a young maid with travel much oppress'd,
0 1181     And faints for succour.
0 1182 
0 1183   CORIN. Fair sir, I pity her,
0 1184     And wish, for her sake more than for mine own,
0 1185     My fortunes were more able to relieve her;
0 1186     But I am shepherd to another man,
0 1187     And do not shear the fleeces that I graze.
0 1188     My master is of churlish disposition,
0 1189     And little recks to find the way to heaven
0 1190     By doing deeds of hospitality.
0 1191     Besides, his cote, his flocks, and bounds of feed,
0 1192     Are now on sale; and at our sheepcote now,
0 1193     By reason of his absence, there is nothing
0 1194     That you will feed on; but what is, come see,
0 1195     And in my voice most welcome shall you be.
0 1196 
0 1197   ROSALIND. What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?
0 1198 
0 1199   CORIN. That young swain that you saw here but erewhile,
0 1200     That little cares for buying any thing.
0 1201 
0 1202   ROSALIND. I pray thee, if it stand with honesty,
0 1203     Buy thou the cottage, pasture, and the flock,
0 1204     And thou shalt have to pay for it of us.
0 1205 
0 1206   CELIA. And we will mend thy wages. I like this place,
0 1207     And willingly could waste my time in it.
0 1208 
0 1209   CORIN. Assuredly the thing is to be sold.
0 1210     Go with me; if you like upon report
0 1211     The soil, the profit, and this kind of life,
0 1212     I will your very faithful feeder be,
0 1213     And buy it with your gold right suddenly.             Exeunt
0 1214 
0 1215 
0 1216 SCENE V.
0 1217 
0 1218 Another part of the forest
0 1219 
0 1220 Enter AMIENS, JAQUES, and OTHERS
0 1221 
0 1222                        SONG
0 1223 
0 1224   AMIENS.    Under the greenwood tree
0 1225                Who loves to lie with me,
0 1226                And turn his merry note
0 1227                Unto the sweet bird's throat,
0 1228              Come hither, come hither, come hither.
0 1229                Here shall he see
0 1230                No enemy
0 1231              But winter and rough weather.
0 1232 
0 1233 
0 1234   JAQUES. More, more, I prithee, more.
0 1235 
0 1236   AMIENS. It will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques.
0 1237 
0 1238   JAQUES. I thank it. More, I prithee, more. I can suck melancholy
0 1239     out of a song, as a weasel sucks eggs. More, I prithee, more.
0 1240 
0 1241   AMIENS. My voice is ragged; I know I cannot please you.
0 1242 
0 1243   JAQUES. I do not desire you to please me; I do desire you to sing.
0 1244     Come, more; another stanzo. Call you 'em stanzos?
0 1245 
0 1246   AMIENS. What you will, Monsieur Jaques.
0 1247 
0 1248   JAQUES. Nay, I care not for their names; they owe me nothing.
0 1249     Will you sing?
0 1250 
0 1251   AMIENS. More at your request than to please myself.
0 1252 
0 1253   JAQUES. Well then, if ever I thank any man, I'll thank you; but
0 1254     that they call compliment is like th' encounter of two dog-apes;
0 1255     and when a man thanks me heartily, methinks have given him a
0 1256     penny, and he renders me the beggarly thanks. Come, sing; and you
0 1257     that will not, hold your tongues.
0 1258 
0 1259   AMIENS. Well, I'll end the song. Sirs, cover the while; the Duke
0 1260     will drink under this tree. He hath been all this day to look
0 1261     you.
0 1262 
0 1263   JAQUES. And I have been all this day to avoid him. He is to
0 1264     disputable for my company. I think of as many matters as he; but
0 1265     I give heaven thanks, and make no boast of them. Come, warble,
0 1266     come.
0 1267 
0 1268                        SONG
0 1269               [All together here]
0 1270 
0 1271            Who doth ambition shun,
0 1272            And loves to live i' th' sun,
0 1273            Seeking the food he eats,
0 1274            And pleas'd with what he gets,
0 1275          Come hither, come hither, come hither.
0 1276            Here shall he see
0 1277            No enemy
0 1278            But winter and rough weather.
0 1279 
0 1280 
0 1281   JAQUES. I'll give you a verse to this note that I made yesterday in
0 1282     despite of my invention.
0 1283 
0 1284   AMIENS. And I'll sing it.
0 1285 
0 1286   JAQUES. Thus it goes:
0 1287 
0 1288              If it do come to pass
0 1289              That any man turn ass,
0 1290              Leaving his wealth and ease
0 1291              A stubborn will to please,
0 1292            Ducdame, ducdame, ducdame;
0 1293              Here shall he see
0 1294              Gross fools as he,
0 1295              An if he will come to me.
0 1296 
0 1297 
0 1298   AMIENS. What's that 'ducdame'?
0 1299 
0 1300   JAQUES. 'Tis a Greek invocation, to call fools into a circle.
0 1301     I'll go sleep, if I can; if I cannot, I'll rail against all the
0 1302     first-born of Egypt.
0 1303 
0 1304   AMIENS. And I'll go seek the Duke; his banquet is prepar'd.
0 1305                                                 Exeunt severally

0 1307 
0 1308 SCENE VI.
0 1309 
0 1310 The forest
0 1311 
0 1312 Enter ORLANDO and ADAM
0 1313 
0 1314 
0 1315   ADAM. Dear master, I can go no further. O, I die for food! Here lie
0 1316     I down, and measure out my grave. Farewell, kind master.
0 1317 
0 1318   ORLANDO. Why, how now, Adam! No greater heart in thee? Live a
0 1319     little; comfort a little; cheer thyself a little. If this uncouth
0 1320     forest yield anything savage, I will either be food for it or
0 1321     bring it for food to thee. Thy conceit is nearer death than thy
0 1322     powers. For my sake be comfortable; hold death awhile at the
0 1323     arm's end. I will here be with the presently; and if I bring thee
0 1324     not something to eat, I will give thee leave to die; but if thou
0 1325     diest before I come, thou art a mocker of my labour. Well said!
0 1326     thou look'st cheerly; and I'll be with thee quickly. Yet thou
0 1327     liest in the bleak air. Come, I will bear thee to some shelter;
0 1328     and thou shalt not die for lack of a dinner, if there live
0 1329     anything in this desert. Cheerly, good Adam!          Exeunt
0 1330 
0 1331 
0 1332 SCENE VII.
0 1333 
0 1334 The forest
0 1335 
0 1336 A table set out. Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and LORDS, like outlaws
0 1337 
0 1338 
0 1339   DUKE SENIOR. I think he be transform'd into a beast;
0 1340     For I can nowhere find him like a man.
0 1341 
0 1342   FIRST LORD. My lord, he is but even now gone hence;
0 1343     Here was he merry, hearing of a song.
0 1344 
0 1345   DUKE SENIOR. If he, compact of jars, grow musical,
0 1346     We shall have shortly discord in the spheres.
0 1347     Go seek him; tell him I would speak with him.
0 1348 
0 1349                          Enter JAQUES
0 1350 
0 1351 
0 1352   FIRST LORD. He saves my labour by his own approach.
0 1353 
0 1354   DUKE SENIOR. Why, how now, monsieur! what a life is this,
0 1355     That your poor friends must woo your company?
0 1356     What, you look merrily!
0 1357 
0 1358   JAQUES. A fool, a fool! I met a fool i' th' forest,
0 1359     A motley fool. A miserable world!
0 1360     As I do live by food, I met a fool,
0 1361     Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun,
0 1362     And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms,
0 1363     In good set terms- and yet a motley fool.
0 1364     'Good morrow, fool,' quoth I; 'No, sir,' quoth he,
0 1365     'Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune.'
0 1366     And then he drew a dial from his poke,
0 1367     And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,
0 1368     Says very wisely, 'It is ten o'clock;
0 1369     Thus we may see,' quoth he, 'how the world wags;
0 1370     'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine;
0 1371     And after one hour more 'twill be eleven;
0 1372     And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,
0 1373     And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot;
0 1374     And thereby hangs a tale.' When I did hear
0 1375     The motley fool thus moral on the time,
0 1376     My lungs began to crow like chanticleer
0 1377     That fools should be so deep contemplative;
0 1378     And I did laugh sans intermission
0 1379     An hour by his dial. O noble fool!
0 1380     A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.
0 1381 
0 1382   DUKE SENIOR. What fool is this?
0 1383 
0 1384   JAQUES. O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,
0 1385     And says, if ladies be but young and fair,
0 1386     They have the gift to know it; and in his brain,
0 1387     Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit
0 1388     After a voyage, he hath strange places cramm'd
0 1389     With observation, the which he vents
0 1390     In mangled forms. O that I were a fool!
0 1391     I am ambitious for a motley coat.
0 1392 
0 1393   DUKE SENIOR. Thou shalt have one.
0 1394 
0 1395   JAQUES. It is my only suit,
0 1396     Provided that you weed your better judgments
0 1397     Of all opinion that grows rank in them
0 1398     That I am wise. I must have liberty
0 1399     Withal, as large a charter as the wind,
0 1400     To blow on whom I please, for so fools have;
0 1401     And they that are most galled with my folly,
0 1402     They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?
0 1403     The why is plain as way to parish church:
0 1404     He that a fool doth very wisely hit
0 1405     Doth very foolishly, although he smart,
0 1406     Not to seem senseless of the bob; if not,
0 1407     The wise man's folly is anatomiz'd
0 1408     Even by the squand'ring glances of the fool.
0 1409     Invest me in my motley; give me leave
0 1410     To speak my mind, and I will through and through
0 1411     Cleanse the foul body of th' infected world,
0 1412     If they will patiently receive my medicine.
0 1413 
0 1414   DUKE SENIOR. Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do.
0 1415 
0 1416   JAQUES. What, for a counter, would I do but good?
0 1417 
0 1418   DUKE SENIOR. Most Mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin;
0 1419     For thou thyself hast been a libertine,
0 1420     As sensual as the brutish sting itself;
0 1421     And all th' embossed sores and headed evils
0 1422     That thou with license of free foot hast caught
0 1423     Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.
0 1424 
0 1425   JAQUES. Why, who cries out on pride
0 1426     That can therein tax any private party?
0 1427     Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea,
0 1428     Till that the wearer's very means do ebb?
0 1429     What woman in the city do I name
0 1430     When that I say the city-woman bears
0 1431     The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?
0 1432     Who can come in and say that I mean her,
0 1433     When such a one as she such is her neighbour?
0 1434     Or what is he of basest function
0 1435     That says his bravery is not on my cost,
0 1436     Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits
0 1437     His folly to the mettle of my speech?
0 1438     There then! how then? what then? Let me see wherein
0 1439     My tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right,
0 1440     Then he hath wrong'd himself; if he be free,
0 1441     Why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies,
0 1442     Unclaim'd of any man. But who comes here?
0 1443 
0 1444              Enter ORLANDO with his sword drawn
0 1445 
0 1446 
0 1447   ORLANDO. Forbear, and eat no more.
0 1448 
0 1449   JAQUES. Why, I have eat none yet.
0 1450 
0 1451   ORLANDO. Nor shalt not, till necessity be serv'd.
0 1452 
0 1453   JAQUES. Of what kind should this cock come of?
0 1454 
0 1455   DUKE SENIOR. Art thou thus bolden'd, man, by thy distress?
0 1456     Or else a rude despiser of good manners,
0 1457     That in civility thou seem'st so empty?
0 1458 
0 1459   ORLANDO. You touch'd my vein at first: the thorny point
0 1460     Of bare distress hath ta'en from me the show
0 1461     Of smooth civility; yet arn I inland bred,
0 1462     And know some nurture. But forbear, I say;
0 1463     He dies that touches any of this fruit
0 1464     Till I and my affairs are answered.
0 1465 
0 1466   JAQUES. An you will not be answer'd with reason, I must die.
0 1467 
0 1468   DUKE SENIOR. What would you have? Your gentleness shall force
0 1469     More than your force move us to gentleness.
0 1470 
0 1471   ORLANDO. I almost die for food, and let me have it.
0 1472 
0 1473   DUKE SENIOR. Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.
0 1474 
0 1475   ORLANDO. Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you;
0 1476     I thought that all things had been savage here,
0 1477     And therefore put I on the countenance
0 1478     Of stern commandment. But whate'er you are
0 1479     That in this desert inaccessible,
0 1480     Under the shade of melancholy boughs,
0 1481     Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time;
0 1482     If ever you have look'd on better days,
0 1483     If ever been where bells have knoll'd to church,
0 1484     If ever sat at any good man's feast,
0 1485     If ever from your eyelids wip'd a tear,
0 1486     And know what 'tis to pity and be pitied,
0 1487     Let gentleness my strong enforcement be;
0 1488     In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword.
0 1489 
0 1490   DUKE SENIOR. True is it that we have seen better days,
0 1491     And have with holy bell been knoll'd to church,
0 1492     And sat at good men's feasts, and wip'd our eyes
0 1493     Of drops that sacred pity hath engend'red;
0 1494     And therefore sit you down in gentleness,
0 1495     And take upon command what help we have
0 1496     That to your wanting may be minist'red.
0 1497 
0 1498   ORLANDO. Then but forbear your food a little while,
0 1499     Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn,
0 1500     And give it food. There is an old poor man
0 1501     Who after me hath many a weary step
0 1502     Limp'd in pure love; till he be first suffic'd,
0 1503     Oppress'd with two weak evils, age and hunger,
0 1504     I will not touch a bit.
0 1505 
0 1506   DUKE SENIOR. Go find him out.
0 1507     And we will nothing waste till you return.
0 1508 
0 1509   ORLANDO. I thank ye; and be blest for your good comfort!
0 1510  Exit
0 1511 
0 1512   DUKE SENIOR. Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy:
0 1513     This wide and universal theatre
0 1514     Presents more woeful pageants than the scene
0 1515     Wherein we play in.
0 1516 
0 1517   JAQUES. All the world's a stage,
0 1518     And all the men and women merely players;
0 1519     They have their exits and their entrances;
0 1520     And one man in his time plays many parts,
0 1521     His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
0 1522     Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms;
0 1523     Then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
0 1524     And shining morning face, creeping like snail
0 1525     Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
0 1526     Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
0 1527     Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
0 1528     Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,
0 1529     Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
0 1530     Seeking the bubble reputation
0 1531     Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
0 1532     In fair round belly with good capon lin'd,
0 1533     With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
0 1534     Full of wise saws and modern instances;
0 1535     And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
0 1536     Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,
0 1537     With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,
0 1538     His youthful hose, well sav'd, a world too wide
0 1539     For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
0 1540     Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
0 1541     And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
0 1542     That ends this strange eventful history,
0 1543     Is second childishness and mere oblivion;
0 1544     Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans every thing.
0 1545 
0 1546                   Re-enter ORLANDO with ADAM
0 1547 
0 1548 
0 1549   DUKE SENIOR. Welcome. Set down your venerable burden.
0 1550     And let him feed.
0 1551 
0 1552   ORLANDO. I thank you most for him.
0 1553 
0 1554   ADAM. So had you need;
0 1555     I scarce can speak to thank you for myself.
0 1556 
0 1557   DUKE SENIOR. Welcome; fall to. I will not trouble you
0 1558     As yet to question you about your fortunes.
0 1559     Give us some music; and, good cousin, sing.
0 1560 
0 1561                          SONG
0 1562             Blow, blow, thou winter wind,
0 1563             Thou art not so unkind
0 1564               As man's ingratitude;
0 1565             Thy tooth is not so keen,
0 1566             Because thou art not seen,
0 1567               Although thy breath be rude.
0 1568     Heigh-ho! sing heigh-ho! unto the green holly.
0 1569     Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly.
0 1570             Then, heigh-ho, the holly!
0 1571               This life is most jolly.
0 1572 
0 1573             Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,
0 1574             That dost not bite so nigh
0 1575               As benefits forgot;
0 1576             Though thou the waters warp,
0 1577             Thy sting is not so sharp
0 1578               As friend rememb'red not.
0 1579     Heigh-ho! sing, &c.
0 1580 
0 1581 
0 1582   DUKE SENIOR. If that you were the good Sir Rowland's son,
0 1583     As you have whisper'd faithfully you were,
0 1584     And as mine eye doth his effigies witness
0 1585     Most truly limn'd and living in your face,
0 1586     Be truly welcome hither. I am the Duke
0 1587     That lov'd your father. The residue of your fortune,
0 1588     Go to my cave and tell me. Good old man,
0 1589     Thou art right welcome as thy master is.
0 1590     Support him by the arm. Give me your hand,
0 1591     And let me all your fortunes understand.              Exeunt
0 1592 
0 1593

0 1596 ACT III. SCENE I.
0 1597 
0 1598 The palace
0 1599 
0 1600 Enter DUKE FREDERICK, OLIVER, and LORDS
0 1601 
0 1602 
0 1603   FREDERICK. Not see him since! Sir, sir, that cannot be.
0 1604     But were I not the better part made mercy,
0 1605     I should not seek an absent argument
0 1606     Of my revenge, thou present. But look to it:
0 1607     Find out thy brother wheresoe'er he is;
0 1608     Seek him with candle; bring him dead or living
0 1609     Within this twelvemonth, or turn thou no more
0 1610     To seek a living in our territory.
0 1611     Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine
0 1612     Worth seizure do we seize into our hands,
0 1613     Till thou canst quit thee by thy brother's mouth
0 1614     Of what we think against thee.
0 1615 
0 1616   OLIVER. O that your Highness knew my heart in this!
0 1617     I never lov'd my brother in my life.
0 1618 
0 1619   FREDERICK. More villain thou. Well, push him out of doors;
0 1620     And let my officers of such a nature
0 1621     Make an extent upon his house and lands.
0 1622     Do this expediently, and turn him going.              Exeunt

0 1625 SCENE II.
0 1626 
0 1627 The forest
0 1628 
0 1629 Enter ORLANDO, with a paper
0 1630 
0 1631 
0 1632   ORLANDO. Hang there, my verse, in witness of my love;
0 1633     And thou, thrice-crowned Queen of Night, survey
0 1634     With thy chaste eye, from thy pale sphere above,
0 1635     Thy huntress' name that my full life doth sway.
0 1636     O Rosalind! these trees shall be my books,
0 1637     And in their barks my thoughts I'll character,
0 1638     That every eye which in this forest looks
0 1639     Shall see thy virtue witness'd every where.
0 1640     Run, run, Orlando; carve on every tree,
0 1641     The fair, the chaste, and unexpressive she.             Exit
0 1642 
0 1643                      Enter CORIN and TOUCHSTONE
0 1644 
0 1645 
0 1646   CORIN. And how like you this shepherd's life, Master Touchstone?
0 1647 
0 1648   TOUCHSTONE. Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good
0 1649     life; but in respect that it is a shepherd's life, it is nought.
0 1650     In respect that it is solitary, I like it very well; but in
0 1651     respect that it is private, it is a very vile life. Now in
0 1652     respect it is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in respect
0 1653     it is not in the court, it is tedious. As it is a spare life,
0 1654     look you, it fits my humour well; but as there is no more plenty
0 1655     in it, it goes much against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in
0 1656     thee, shepherd?
0 1657 
0 1658   CORIN. No more but that I know the more one sickens the worse at
0 1659     ease he is; and that he that wants money, means, and content, is
0 1660     without three good friends; that the property of rain is to wet,
0 1661     and fire to burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep; and that a
0 1662     great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that he that hath
0 1663     learned no wit by nature nor art may complain of good breeding,
0 1664     or comes of a very dull kindred.
0 1665 
0 1666   TOUCHSTONE. Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in
0 1667     court, shepherd?
0 1668 
0 1669   CORIN. No, truly.
0 1670 
0 1671   TOUCHSTONE. Then thou art damn'd.
0 1672 
0 1673   CORIN. Nay, I hope.
0 1674 
0 1675   TOUCHSTONE. Truly, thou art damn'd, like an ill-roasted egg, all on
0 1676     one side.
0 1677 
0 1678   CORIN. For not being at court? Your reason.
0 1679 
0 1680   TOUCHSTONE. Why, if thou never wast at court thou never saw'st good
0 1681     manners; if thou never saw'st good manners, then thy manners must
0 1682     be wicked; and wickedness is sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art
0 1683     in a parlous state, shepherd.
0 1684 
0 1685   CORIN. Not a whit, Touchstone. Those that are good manners at the
0 1686     court are as ridiculous in the country as the behaviour of the
0 1687     country is most mockable at the court. You told me you salute not
0 1688     at the court, but you kiss your hands; that courtesy would be
0 1689     uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds.
0 1690 
0 1691   TOUCHSTONE. Instance, briefly; come, instance.
0 1692 
0 1693   CORIN. Why, we are still handling our ewes; and their fells, you
0 1694     know, are greasy.
0 1695 
0 1696   TOUCHSTONE. Why, do not your courtier's hands sweat? And is not the
0 1697     grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man?
0 1698     Shallow, shallow. A better instance, I say; come.
0 1699 
0 1700   CORIN. Besides, our hands are hard.
0 1701 
0 1702   TOUCHSTONE. Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again.
0 1703     A more sounder instance; come.
0 1704 
0 1705   CORIN. And they are often tarr'd over with the surgery of our
0 1706     sheep; and would you have us kiss tar? The courtier's hands are
0 1707     perfum'd with civet.
0 1708 
0 1709   TOUCHSTONE. Most shallow man! thou worm's meat in respect of a good
0 1710     piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise, and perpend: civet is
0 1711     of a baser birth than tar- the very uncleanly flux of a cat.
0 1712     Mend the instance, shepherd.
0 1713 
0 1714   CORIN. You have too courtly a wit for me; I'll rest.
0 1715 
0 1716   TOUCHSTONE. Wilt thou rest damn'd? God help thee, shallow man!
0 1717     God make incision in thee! thou art raw.
0 1718 
0 1719   CORIN. Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get that I
0 1720     wear; owe no man hate, envy no man's happiness; glad of other
0 1721     men's good, content with my harm; and the greatest of my pride is
0 1722     to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck.
0 1723 
0 1724   TOUCHSTONE. That is another simple sin in you: to bring the ewes
0 1725     and the rams together, and to offer to get your living by the
0 1726     copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a bell-wether, and to betray
0 1727     a she-lamb of a twelvemonth to crooked-pated, old, cuckoldly ram,
0 1728     out of all reasonable match. If thou beest not damn'd for this,
0 1729     the devil himself will have no shepherds; I cannot see else how
0 1730     thou shouldst scape.
0 1731 
0 1732   CORIN. Here comes young Master Ganymede, my new mistress's brother.
0 1733 
0 1734                   Enter ROSALIND, reading a paper
0 1735 
0 1736 
0 1737   ROSALIND.   'From the east to western Inde,
0 1738               No jewel is like Rosalinde.
0 1739               Her worth, being mounted on the wind,
0 1740               Through all the world bears Rosalinde.
0 1741               All the pictures fairest lin'd
0 1742               Are but black to Rosalinde.
0 1743               Let no face be kept in mind
0 1744               But the fair of Rosalinde.'
0 1745 
0 1746   TOUCHSTONE. I'll rhyme you so eight years together, dinners, and
0 1747     suppers, and sleeping hours, excepted. It is the right
0 1748     butter-women's rank to market.
0 1749 
0 1750   ROSALIND. Out, fool!
0 1751 
0 1752   TOUCHSTONE.   For a taste:
0 1753                 If a hart do lack a hind,
0 1754                 Let him seek out Rosalinde.
0 1755                 If the cat will after kind,
0 1756                 So be sure will Rosalinde.
0 1757                 Winter garments must be lin'd,
0 1758                 So must slender Rosalinde.
0 1759                 They that reap must sheaf and bind,
0 1760                 Then to cart with Rosalinde.
0 1761                 Sweetest nut hath sourest rind,
0 1762                 Such a nut is Rosalinde.
0 1763                 He that sweetest rose will find
0 1764                 Must find love's prick and Rosalinde.
0 1765     This is the very false gallop of verses; why do you infect
0 1766     yourself with them?
0 1767 
0 1768   ROSALIND. Peace, you dull fool! I found them on a tree.
0 1769 
0 1770   TOUCHSTONE. Truly, the tree yields bad fruit.
0 1771 
0 1772   ROSALIND. I'll graff it with you, and then I shall graff it with a
0 1773     medlar. Then it will be the earliest fruit i' th' country; for
0 1774     you'll be rotten ere you be half ripe, and that's the right
0 1775     virtue of the medlar.
0 1776 
0 1777   TOUCHSTONE. You have said; but whether wisely or no, let the forest
0 1778     judge.
0 1779 
0 1780                       Enter CELIA, with a writing
0 1781 
0 1782 
0 1783   ROSALIND. Peace!
0 1784     Here comes my sister, reading; stand aside.
0 1785 
0 1786   CELIA.   'Why should this a desert be?
0 1787              For it is unpeopled? No;
0 1788            Tongues I'll hang on every tree
0 1789              That shall civil sayings show.
0 1790            Some, how brief the life of man
0 1791              Runs his erring pilgrimage,
0 1792            That the streching of a span
0 1793              Buckles in his sum of age;
0 1794            Some, of violated vows
0 1795              'Twixt the souls of friend and friend;
0 1796            But upon the fairest boughs,
0 1797              Or at every sentence end,
0 1798            Will I Rosalinda write,
0 1799              Teaching all that read to know
0 1800            The quintessence of every sprite
0 1801              Heaven would in little show.
0 1802            Therefore heaven Nature charg'd
0 1803              That one body should be fill'd
0 1804            With all graces wide-enlarg'd.
0 1805              Nature presently distill'd
0 1806            Helen's cheek, but not her heart,
0 1807              Cleopatra's majesty,
0 1808            Atalanta's better part,
0 1809              Sad Lucretia's modesty.
0 1810            Thus Rosalinde of many parts
0 1811              By heavenly synod was devis'd,
0 1812            Of many faces, eyes, and hearts,
0 1813              To have the touches dearest priz'd.
0 1814            Heaven would that she these gifts should have,
0 1815            And I to live and die her slave.'
0 1816 
0 1817   ROSALIND. O most gentle pulpiter! What tedious homily of love have
0 1818     you wearied your parishioners withal, and never cried 'Have
0 1819     patience, good people.'
0 1820 
0 1821   CELIA. How now! Back, friends; shepherd, go off a little; go with
0 1822     him, sirrah.
0 1823 
0 1824   TOUCHSTONE. Come, shepherd, let us make an honourable retreat;
0 1825 
0 1826     though not with bag and baggage, yet with scrip and scrippage.
0 1827                                      Exeunt CORIN and TOUCHSTONE
0 1828 
0 1829   CELIA. Didst thou hear these verses?
0 1830 
0 1831   ROSALIND. O, yes, I heard them all, and more too; for some of them
0 1832     had in them more feet than the verses would bear.
0 1833 
0 1834   CELIA. That's no matter; the feet might bear the verses.
0 1835 
0 1836   ROSALIND. Ay, but the feet were lame, and could not bear themselves
0 1837     without the verse, and therefore stood lamely in the verse.
0 1838 
0 1839   CELIA. But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be
0 1840     hang'd and carved upon these trees?
0 1841 
0 1842   ROSALIND. I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder before you
0 1843     came; for look here what I found on a palm-tree. I was never so
0 1844     berhym'd since Pythagoras' time that I was an Irish rat,
0 1845     which I can hardly remember.
0 1846 
0 1847   CELIA. Trow you who hath done this?
0 1848 
0 1849   ROSALIND. Is it a man?
0 1850 
0 1851   CELIA. And a chain, that you once wore, about his neck.
0 1852     Change you colour?
0 1853 
0 1854   ROSALIND. I prithee, who?
0 1855 
0 1856   CELIA. O Lord, Lord! it is a hard matter for friends to meet; but
0 1857     mountains may be remov'd with earthquakes, and so encounter.
0 1858 
0 1859   ROSALIND. Nay, but who is it?
0 1860 
0 1861   CELIA. Is it possible?
0 1862 
0 1863   ROSALIND. Nay, I prithee now, with most petitionary vehemence, tell
0 1864     me who it is.
0 1865 
0 1866   CELIA. O wonderful, wonderful, most wonderful wonderful, and yet
0 1867     again wonderful, and after that, out of all whooping!
0 1868 
0 1869   ROSALIND. Good my complexion! dost thou think, though I am
0 1870     caparison'd like a man, I have a doublet and hose in my
0 1871     disposition? One inch of delay more is a South Sea of discovery.
0 1872     I prithee tell me who is it quickly, and speak apace. I would
0 1873     thou could'st stammer, that thou mightst pour this conceal'd man
0 1874     out of thy mouth, as wine comes out of narrow-mouth'd bottle-
0 1875     either too much at once or none at all. I prithee take the cork
0 1876     out of thy mouth that I may drink thy tidings.
0 1877 
0 1878   CELIA. So you may put a man in your belly.
0 1879 
0 1880   ROSALIND. Is he of God's making? What manner of man?
0 1881     Is his head worth a hat or his chin worth a beard?
0 1882 
0 1883   CELIA. Nay, he hath but a little beard.
0 1884 
0 1885   ROSALIND. Why, God will send more if the man will be thankful.
0 1886     Let me stay the growth of his beard, if thou delay me not the
0 1887     knowledge of his chin.
0 1888 
0 1889   CELIA. It is young Orlando, that tripp'd up the wrestler's heels
0 1890     and your heart both in an instant.
0 1891 
0 1892   ROSALIND. Nay, but the devil take mocking! Speak sad brow and true
0 1893     maid.
0 1894 
0 1895   CELIA. I' faith, coz, 'tis he.
0 1896 
0 1897   ROSALIND. Orlando?
0 1898 
0 1899   CELIA. Orlando.
0 1900 
0 1901   ROSALIND. Alas the day! what shall I do with my doublet and hose?
0 1902     What did he when thou saw'st him? What said he? How look'd he?
0 1903     Wherein went he? What makes he here? Did he ask for me? Where
0 1904     remains he? How parted he with thee? And when shalt thou see him
0 1905     again? Answer me in one word.
0 1906 
0 1907   CELIA. You must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first; 'tis a word too
0 1908     great for any mouth of this age's size. To say ay and no to these
0 1909     particulars is more than to answer in a catechism.
0 1910 
0 1911   ROSALIND. But doth he know that I am in this forest, and in man's
0 1912     apparel? Looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled?
0 1913 
0 1914   CELIA. It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the
0 1915     propositions of a lover; but take a taste of my finding him, and
0 1916     relish it with good observance. I found him under a tree, like a
0 1917     dropp'd acorn.
0 1918 
0 1919   ROSALIND. It may well be call'd Jove's tree, when it drops forth
0 1920     such fruit.
0 1921 
0 1922   CELIA. Give me audience, good madam.
0 1923 
0 1924   ROSALIND. Proceed.
0 1925 
0 1926   CELIA. There lay he, stretch'd along like a wounded knight.
0 1927 
0 1928   ROSALIND. Though it be pity to see such a sight, it well becomes
0 1929     the ground.
0 1930 
0 1931   CELIA. Cry 'Holla' to thy tongue, I prithee; it curvets
0 1932     unseasonably. He was furnish'd like a hunter.
0 1933 
0 1934   ROSALIND. O, ominous! he comes to kill my heart.
0 1935 
0 1936   CELIA. I would sing my song without a burden; thou bring'st me out
0 1937     of tune.
0 1938 
0 1939   ROSALIND. Do you not know I am a woman? When I think, I must speak.
0 1940     Sweet, say on.
0 1941 
0 1942   CELIA. You bring me out. Soft! comes he not here?
0 1943 
0 1944                    Enter ORLANDO and JAQUES
0 1945 
0 1946 
0 1947   ROSALIND. 'Tis he; slink by, and note him.
0 1948 
0 1949   JAQUES. I thank you for your company; but, good faith, I had as
0 1950     lief have been myself alone.
0 1951 
0 1952   ORLANDO. And so had I; but yet, for fashion sake, I thank you too
0 1953     for your society.
0 1954 
0 1955   JAQUES. God buy you; let's meet as little as we can.
0 1956 
0 1957   ORLANDO. I do desire we may be better strangers.
0 1958 
0 1959   JAQUES. I pray you mar no more trees with writing love songs in
0 1960     their barks.
0 1961 
0 1962   ORLANDO. I pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them
0 1963     ill-favouredly.
0 1964 
0 1965   JAQUES. Rosalind is your love's name?
0 1966 
0 1967   ORLANDO. Yes, just.
0 1968 
0 1969   JAQUES. I do not like her name.
0 1970 
0 1971   ORLANDO. There was no thought of pleasing you when she was
0 1972     christen'd.
0 1973 
0 1974   JAQUES. What stature is she of?
0 1975 
0 1976   ORLANDO. Just as high as my heart.
0 1977 
0 1978   JAQUES. You are full of pretty answers. Have you not been
0 1979     acquainted with goldsmiths' wives, and conn'd them out of rings?
0 1980 
0 1981   ORLANDO. Not so; but I answer you right painted cloth, from whence
0 1982     you have studied your questions.
0 1983 
0 1984   JAQUES. You have a nimble wit; I think 'twas made of Atalanta's
0 1985     heels. Will you sit down with me? and we two will rail against
0 1986     our mistress the world, and all our misery.
0 1987 
0 1988   ORLANDO. I will chide no breather in the world but myself, against
0 1989     whom I know most faults.
0 1990 
0 1991   JAQUES. The worst fault you have is to be in love.
0 1992 
0 1993   ORLANDO. 'Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue. I am
0 1994     weary of you.
0 1995 
0 1996   JAQUES. By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I found you.
0 1997 
0 1998   ORLANDO. He is drown'd in the brook; look but in, and you shall see
0 1999     him.
0 2000 
0 2001   JAQUES. There I shall see mine own figure.
0 2002 
0 2003   ORLANDO. Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher.
0 2004 
0 2005   JAQUES. I'll tarry no longer with you; farewell, good Signior Love.
0 2006 
0 2007   ORLANDO. I am glad of your departure; adieu, good Monsieur
0 2008     Melancholy.
0 2009                                                      Exit JAQUES
0 2010 
0 2011 
0 2012   ROSALIND. [Aside to CELIA] I will speak to him like a saucy lackey,
0 2013     and under that habit play the knave with him.- Do you hear,
0 2014     forester?
0 2015 
0 2016   ORLANDO. Very well; what would you?
0 2017 
0 2018   ROSALIND. I pray you, what is't o'clock?
0 2019 
0 2020   ORLANDO. You should ask me what time o' day; there's no clock in
0 2021     the forest.
0 2022 
0 2023   ROSALIND. Then there is no true lover in the forest, else sighing
0 2024     every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot
0 2025     of Time as well as a clock.
0 2026 
0 2027   ORLANDO. And why not the swift foot of Time? Had not that been as
0 2028     proper?
0 2029 
0 2030   ROSALIND. By no means, sir. Time travels in divers paces with
0 2031     divers persons. I'll tell you who Time ambles withal, who Time
0 2032     trots withal, who Time gallops withal, and who he stands still
0 2033     withal.
0 2034 
0 2035   ORLANDO. I prithee, who doth he trot withal?
0 2036 
0 2037   ROSALIND. Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the
0 2038     contract of her marriage and the day it is solemniz'd; if the
0 2039     interim be but a se'nnight, Time's pace is so hard that it seems
0 2040     the length of seven year.
0 2041 
0 2042   ORLANDO. Who ambles Time withal?
0 2043 
0 2044   ROSALIND. With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that hath
0 2045     not the gout; for the one sleeps easily because he cannot study,
0 2046     and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain; the one
0 2047     lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning, the other
0 2048     knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury. These Time ambles
0 2049     withal.
0 2050 
0 2051   ORLANDO. Who doth he gallop withal?
0 2052 
0 2053   ROSALIND. With a thief to the gallows; for though he go as softly
0 2054     as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.
0 2055 
0 2056   ORLANDO. Who stays it still withal?
0 2057 
0 2058   ROSALIND. With lawyers in the vacation; for they sleep between term
0 2059     and term, and then they perceive not how Time moves.
0 2060 
0 2061   ORLANDO. Where dwell you, pretty youth?
0 2062 
0 2063   ROSALIND. With this shepherdess, my sister; here in the skirts of
0 2064     the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat.
0 2065 
0 2066   ORLANDO. Are you native of this place?
0 2067 
0 2068   ROSALIND. As the coney that you see dwell where she is kindled.
0 2069 
0 2070   ORLANDO. Your accent is something finer than you could purchase in
0 2071     so removed a dwelling.
0 2072 
0 2073   ROSALIND. I have been told so of many; but indeed an old religious
0 2074     uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was in his youth an inland
0 2075     man; one that knew courtship too well, for there he fell in love.
0 2076     I have heard him read many lectures against it; and I thank God I
0 2077     am not a woman, to be touch'd with so many giddy offences as he
0 2078     hath generally tax'd their whole sex withal.
0 2079 
0 2080   ORLANDO. Can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid
0 2081     to the charge of women?
0 2082 
0 2083   ROSALIND. There were none principal; they were all like one another
0 2084     as halfpence are; every one fault seeming monstrous till his
0 2085     fellow-fault came to match it.
0 2086 
0 2087   ORLANDO. I prithee recount some of them.
0 2088 
0 2089   ROSALIND. No; I will not cast away my physic but on those that are
0 2090     sick. There is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young
0 2091     plants with carving 'Rosalind' on their barks; hangs odes upon
0 2092     hawthorns and elegies on brambles; all, forsooth, deifying the
0 2093     name of Rosalind. If I could meet that fancy-monger, I would give
0 2094     him some good counsel, for he seems to have the quotidian of love
0 2095     upon him.
0 2096 
0 2097   ORLANDO. I am he that is so love-shak'd; I pray you tell me your
0 2098     remedy.
0 2099 
0 2100   ROSALIND. There is none of my uncle's marks upon you; he taught me
0 2101     how to know a man in love; in which cage of rushes I am sure you
0 2102     are not prisoner.
0 2103 
0 2104   ORLANDO. What were his marks?
0 2105 
0 2106   ROSALIND. A lean cheek, which you have not; a blue eye and sunken,
0 2107     which you have not; an unquestionable spirit, which you have not;
0 2108     a beard neglected, which you have not; but I pardon you for that,
0 2109     for simply your having in beard is a younger brother's revenue.
0 2110     Then your hose should be ungarter'd, your bonnet unbanded, your
0 2111     sleeve unbutton'd, your shoe untied, and every thing about you
0 2112     demonstrating a careless desolation. But you are no such man; you
0 2113     are rather point-device in your accoutrements, as loving yourself
0 2114     than seeming the lover of any other.
0 2115 
0 2116   ORLANDO. Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.
0 2117 
0 2118   ROSALIND. Me believe it! You may as soon make her that you love
0 2119     believe it; which, I warrant, she is apter to do than to confess
0 2120     she does. That is one of the points in the which women still give
0 2121     the lie to their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he that
0 2122     hangs the verses on the trees wherein Rosalind is so admired?
0 2123 
0 2124   ORLANDO. I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of Rosalind, I
0 2125     am that he, that unfortunate he.
0 2126 
0 2127   ROSALIND. But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?
0 2128 
0 2129   ORLANDO. Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.
0 2130 
0 2131   ROSALIND. Love is merely a madness; and, I tell you, deserves as
0 2132     well a dark house and a whip as madmen do; and the reason why
0 2133     they are not so punish'd and cured is that the lunacy is so
0 2134     ordinary that the whippers are in love too. Yet I profess curing
0 2135     it by counsel.
0 2136 
0 2137   ORLANDO. Did you ever cure any so?
0 2138 
0 2139   ROSALIND. Yes, one; and in this manner. He was to imagine me his
0 2140     love, his mistress; and I set him every day to woo me; at which
0 2141     time would I, being but a moonish youth, grieve, be effeminate,
0 2142     changeable, longing and liking, proud, fantastical, apish,
0 2143     shallow, inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles; for every
0 2144     passion something and for no passion truly anything, as boys and
0 2145     women are for the most part cattle of this colour; would now like
0 2146     him, now loathe him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now
0 2147     weep for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor from his
0 2148     mad humour of love to a living humour of madness; which was, to
0 2149     forswear the full stream of the world and to live in a nook
0 2150     merely monastic. And thus I cur'd him; and this way will I take
0 2151     upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's heart,
0 2152     that there shall not be one spot of love in 't.
0 2153 
0 2154   ORLANDO. I would not be cured, youth.
0 2155 
0 2156   ROSALIND. I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind, and
0 2157     come every day to my cote and woo me.
0 2158 
0 2159   ORLANDO. Now, by the faith of my love, I will. Tell me where it is.
0 2160 
0 2161   ROSALIND. Go with me to it, and I'll show it you; and, by the way,
0 2162     you shall tell me where in the forest you live. Will you go?
0 2163 
0 2164   ORLANDO. With all my heart, good youth.
0 2165 
0 2166   ROSALIND. Nay, you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you
0 2167     go?                                                   Exeunt
0 2168 
0 2169 
0 2170 SCENE III.
0 2171 
0 2172 The forest
0 2173 
0 2174 Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY; JAQUES behind
0 2175 
0 2176 
0 2177   TOUCHSTONE. Come apace, good Audrey; I will fetch up your goats,
0 2178     Audrey. And how, Audrey, am I the man yet? Doth my simple feature
0 2179     content you?
0 2180 
0 2181   AUDREY. Your features! Lord warrant us! What features?
0 2182 
0 2183   TOUCHSTONE. I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most
0 2184     capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths.
0 2185 
0 2186   JAQUES. [Aside] O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than Jove in a
0 2187     thatch'd house!
0 2188 
0 2189   TOUCHSTONE. When a man's verses cannot be understood, nor a man's
0 2190     good wit seconded with the forward child understanding, it
0 2191     strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room.
0 2192     Truly, I would the gods had made thee poetical.
0 2193 
0 2194   AUDREY. I do not know what 'poetical' is. Is it honest in deed and
0 2195     word? Is it a true thing?
0 2196 
0 2197   TOUCHSTONE. No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most feigning,
0 2198     and lovers are given to poetry; and what they swear in poetry may
0 2199     be said as lovers they do feign.
0 2200 
0 2201   AUDREY. Do you wish, then, that the gods had made me poetical?
0 2202 
0 2203   TOUCHSTONE. I do, truly, for thou swear'st to me thou art honest;
0 2204     now, if thou wert a poet, I might have some hope thou didst
0 2205     feign.
0 2206 
0 2207   AUDREY. Would you not have me honest?
0 2208 
0 2209   TOUCHSTONE. No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favour'd; for honesty
0 2210     coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.
0 2211 
0 2212   JAQUES. [Aside] A material fool!
0 2213 
0 2214   AUDREY. Well, I am not fair; and therefore I pray the gods make me
0 2215     honest.
0 2216 
0 2217   TOUCHSTONE. Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were
0 2218     to put good meat into an unclean dish.
0 2219 
0 2220   AUDREY. I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.
0 2221 
0 2222   TOUCHSTONE. Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness;
0 2223     sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it may be, I will
0 2224     marry thee; and to that end I have been with Sir Oliver Martext,
0 2225     the vicar of the next village, who hath promis'd to meet me in
0 2226     this place of the forest, and to couple us.
0 2227 
0 2228   JAQUES. [Aside] I would fain see this meeting.
0 2229 
0 2230   AUDREY. Well, the gods give us joy!
0 2231 
0 2232   TOUCHSTONE. Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart, stagger
0 2233     in this attempt; for here we have no temple but the wood, no
0 2234     assembly but horn-beasts. But what though? Courage! As horns are
0 2235     odious, they are necessary. It is said: 'Many a man knows no end
0 2236     of his goods.' Right! Many a man has good horns and knows no end
0 2237     of them. Well, that is the dowry of his wife; 'tis none of his
0 2238     own getting. Horns? Even so. Poor men alone? No, no; the noblest
0 2239     deer hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man therefore
0 2240     blessed? No; as a wall'd town is more worthier than a village, so
0 2241     is the forehead of a married man more honourable than the bare
0 2242     brow of a bachelor; and by how much defence is better than no
0 2243     skill, by so much is horn more precious than to want. Here comes
0 2244     Sir Oliver.
0 2245 
0 2246                        Enter SIR OLIVER MARTEXT
0 2247 
0 2248     Sir Oliver Martext, you are well met. Will you dispatch us here
0 2249     under this tree, or shall we go with you to your chapel?
0 2250 
0 2251   MARTEXT. Is there none here to give the woman?
0 2252 
0 2253   TOUCHSTONE. I will not take her on gift of any man.
0 2254 
0 2255   MARTEXT. Truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful.
0 2256 
0 2257   JAQUES. [Discovering himself] Proceed, proceed; I'll give her.
0 2258 
0 2259   TOUCHSTONE. Good even, good Master What-ye-call't; how do you, sir?
0 2260     You are very well met. Goddild you for your last company. I am
0 2261     very glad to see you. Even a toy in hand here, sir. Nay; pray be
0 2262     cover'd.
0 2263 
0 2264   JAQUES. Will you be married, motley?
0 2265 
0 2266   TOUCHSTONE. As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb, and
0 2267     the falcon her bells, so man hath his desires; and as pigeons
0 2268     bill, so wedlock would be nibbling.
0 2269 
0 2270   JAQUES. And will you, being a man of your breeding, be married
0 2271     under a bush, like a beggar? Get you to church and have a good
0 2272     priest that can tell you what marriage is; this fellow will but
0 2273     join you together as they join wainscot; then one of you will
0 2274     prove a shrunk panel, and like green timber warp, warp.
0 2275 
0 2276   TOUCHSTONE. [Aside] I am not in the mind but I were better to be
0 2277     married of him than of another; for he is not like to marry me
0 2278     well; and not being well married, it will be a good excuse for me
0 2279     hereafter to leave my wife.
0 2280 
0 2281   JAQUES. Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.
0 2282 
0 2283   TOUCHSTONE. Come, sweet Audrey;
0 2284     We must be married or we must live in bawdry.
0 2285     Farewell, good Master Oliver. Not-
0 2286                O sweet Oliver,
0 2287                O brave Oliver,
0 2288            Leave me not behind thee.
0 2289     But-
0 2290                  Wind away,
0 2291                Begone, I say,
0 2292            I will not to wedding with thee.
0 2293                            Exeunt JAQUES, TOUCHSTONE, and AUDREY
0 2294 
0 2295   MARTEXT. 'Tis no matter; ne'er a fantastical knave of them all
0 2296     shall flout me out of my calling.                       Exit

0 2298 
0 2299 SCENE IV.
0 2300 
0 2301 The forest
0 2302 
0 2303 Enter ROSALIND and CELIA
0 2304 
0 2305 
0 2306   ROSALIND. Never talk to me; I will weep.
0 2307 
0 2308   CELIA. Do, I prithee; but yet have the grace to consider that tears
0 2309     do not become a man.
0 2310 
0 2311   ROSALIND. But have I not cause to weep?
0 2312 
0 2313   CELIA. As good cause as one would desire; therefore weep.
0 2314 
0 2315   ROSALIND. His very hair is of the dissembling colour.
0 2316 
0 2317   CELIA. Something browner than Judas's.
0 2318     Marry, his kisses are Judas's own children.
0 2319 
0 2320   ROSALIND. I' faith, his hair is of a good colour.
0 2321 
0 2322   CELIA. An excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour.
0 2323 
0 2324   ROSALIND. And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of
0 2325     holy bread.
0 2326 
0 2327   CELIA. He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana. A nun of
0 2328     winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously; the very ice of
0 2329     chastity is in them.
0 2330 
0 2331   ROSALIND. But why did he swear he would come this morning, and
0 2332     comes not?
0 2333 
0 2334   CELIA. Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.
0 2335 
0 2336   ROSALIND. Do you think so?
0 2337 
0 2338   CELIA. Yes; I think he is not a pick-purse nor a horse-stealer; but
0 2339     for his verity in love, I do think him as concave as covered
0 2340     goblet or a worm-eaten nut.
0 2341 
0 2342   ROSALIND. Not true in love?
0 2343 
0 2344   CELIA. Yes, when he is in; but I think he is not in.
0 2345 
0 2346   ROSALIND. You have heard him swear downright he was.
0 2347 
0 2348   CELIA. 'Was' is not 'is'; besides, the oath of a lover is no
0 2349     stronger than the word of a tapster; they are both the confirmer
0 2350     of false reckonings. He attends here in the forest on the Duke,
0 2351     your father.
0 2352 
0 2353   ROSALIND. I met the Duke yesterday, and had much question with him.
0 2354     He asked me of what parentage I was; I told him, of as good as
0 2355     he; so he laugh'd and let me go. But what talk we of fathers when
0 2356     there is such a man as Orlando?
0 2357 
0 2358   CELIA. O, that's a brave man! He writes brave verses, speaks brave
0 2359     words, swears brave oaths, and breaks them bravely, quite
0 2360     traverse, athwart the heart of his lover; as a puny tilter, that
0 2361     spurs his horse but on one side, breaks his staff like a noble
0 2362     goose. But all's brave that youth mounts and folly guides.
0 2363     Who comes here?
0 2364 
0 2365                          Enter CORIN
0 2366 
0 2367 
0 2368   CORIN. Mistress and master, you have oft enquired
0 2369     After the shepherd that complain'd of love,
0 2370     Who you saw sitting by me on the turf,
0 2371     Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess
0 2372     That was his mistress.
0 2373 
0 2374   CELIA. Well, and what of him?
0 2375 
0 2376   CORIN. If you will see a pageant truly play'd
0 2377     Between the pale complexion of true love
0 2378     And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,
0 2379     Go hence a little, and I shall conduct you,
0 2380     If you will mark it.
0 2381 
0 2382   ROSALIND. O, come, let us remove!
0 2383     The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.
0 2384     Bring us to this sight, and you shall say
0 2385     I'll prove a busy actor in their play.                Exeunt

0 2389 
0 2390 Another part of the forest
0 2391 
0 2392 Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE
0 2393 
0 2394 
0 2395   SILVIUS. Sweet Phebe, do not scorn me; do not, Phebe.
0 2396     Say that you love me not; but say not so
0 2397     In bitterness. The common executioner,
0 2398     Whose heart th' accustom'd sight of death makes hard,
0 2399     Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck
0 2400     But first begs pardon. Will you sterner be
0 2401     Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?
0 2402 
0 2403           Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN, at a distance
0 2404 
0 2405 
0 2406   PHEBE. I would not be thy executioner;
0 2407     I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.
0 2408     Thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye.
0 2409     'Tis pretty, sure, and very probable,
0 2410     That eyes, that are the frail'st and softest things,
0 2411     Who shut their coward gates on atomies,
0 2412     Should be call'd tyrants, butchers, murderers!
0 2413     Now I do frown on thee with all my heart;
0 2414     And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee.
0 2415     Now counterfeit to swoon; why, now fall down;
0 2416     Or, if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,
0 2417     Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers.
0 2418     Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee.
0 2419     Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains
0 2420     Some scar of it; lean upon a rush,
0 2421     The cicatrice and capable impressure
0 2422     Thy palm some moment keeps; but now mine eyes,
0 2423     Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not;
0 2424     Nor, I am sure, there is not force in eyes
0 2425     That can do hurt.
0 2426 
0 2427   SILVIUS. O dear Phebe,
0 2428     If ever- as that ever may be near-
0 2429     You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy,
0 2430     Then shall you know the wounds invisible
0 2431     That love's keen arrows make.
0 2432 
0 2433   PHEBE. But till that time
0 2434     Come not thou near me; and when that time comes,
0 2435     Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not;
0 2436     As till that time I shall not pity thee.
0 2437 
0 2438   ROSALIND. [Advancing] And why, I pray you? Who might be your
0 2439       mother,
0 2440     That you insult, exult, and all at once,
0 2441     Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty-
0 2442     As, by my faith, I see no more in you
0 2443     Than without candle may go dark to bed-
0 2444     Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?
0 2445     Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?
0 2446     I see no more in you than in the ordinary
0 2447     Of nature's sale-work. 'Od's my little life,
0 2448     I think she means to tangle my eyes too!
0 2449     No faith, proud mistress, hope not after it;
0 2450     'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,
0 2451     Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,
0 2452     That can entame my spirits to your worship.
0 2453     You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,
0 2454     Like foggy south, puffing with wind and rain?
0 2455     You are a thousand times a properer man
0 2456     Than she a woman. 'Tis such fools as you
0 2457     That makes the world full of ill-favour'd children.
0 2458     'Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her;
0 2459     And out of you she sees herself more proper
0 2460     Than any of her lineaments can show her.
0 2461     But, mistress, know yourself. Down on your knees,
0 2462     And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love;
0 2463     For I must tell you friendly in your ear:
0 2464     Sell when you can; you are not for all markets.
0 2465     Cry the man mercy, love him, take his offer;
0 2466     Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.
0 2467     So take her to thee, shepherd. Fare you well.
0 2468 
0 2469   PHEBE. Sweet youth, I pray you chide a year together;
0 2470     I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.
0 2471 
0 2472   ROSALIND. He's fall'n in love with your foulness, and she'll fall
0 2473     in love with my anger. If it be so, as fast as she answers thee
0 2474     with frowning looks, I'll sauce her with bitter words. Why look
0 2475     you so upon me?
0 2476 
0 2477   PHEBE. For no ill will I bear you.
0 2478 
0 2479   ROSALIND. I pray you do not fall in love with me,
0 2480     For I am falser than vows made in wine;
0 2481     Besides, I like you not. If you will know my house,
0 2482     'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.
0 2483     Will you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard.
0 2484     Come, sister. Shepherdess, look on him better,
0 2485     And be not proud; though all the world could see,
0 2486     None could be so abus'd in sight as he.
0 2487     Come, to our flock.        Exeunt ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN
0 2488 
0 2489   PHEBE. Dead shepherd, now I find thy saw of might:
0 2490     'Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?'
0 2491 
0 2492   SILVIUS. Sweet Phebe.
0 2493 
0 2494   PHEBE. Ha! what say'st thou, Silvius?
0 2495 
0 2496   SILVIUS. Sweet Phebe, pity me.
0 2497 
0 2498   PHEBE. Why, I arn sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.
0 2499 
0 2500   SILVIUS. Wherever sorrow is, relief would be.
0 2501     If you do sorrow at my grief in love,
0 2502     By giving love, your sorrow and my grief
0 2503     Were both extermin'd.
0 2504 
0 2505   PHEBE. Thou hast my love; is not that neighbourly?
0 2506 
0 2507   SILVIUS. I would have you.
0 2508 
0 2509   PHEBE. Why, that were covetousness.
0 2510     Silvius, the time was that I hated thee;
0 2511     And yet it is not that I bear thee love;
0 2512     But since that thou canst talk of love so well,
0 2513     Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,
0 2514     I will endure; and I'll employ thee too.
0 2515     But do not look for further recompense
0 2516     Than thine own gladness that thou art employ'd.
0 2517 
0 2518   SILVIUS. So holy and so perfect is my love,
0 2519     And I in such a poverty of grace,
0 2520     That I shall think it a most plenteous crop
0 2521     To glean the broken ears after the man
0 2522     That the main harvest reaps; loose now and then
0 2523     A scatt'red smile, and that I'll live upon.
0 2524 
0 2525   PHEBE. Know'st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile?
0 2526 
0 2527   SILVIUS. Not very well; but I have met him oft;
0 2528     And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds
0 2529     That the old carlot once was master of.
0 2530 
0 2531   PHEBE. Think not I love him, though I ask for him;
0 2532     'Tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well.
0 2533     But what care I for words? Yet words do well
0 2534     When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.
0 2535     It is a pretty youth- not very pretty;
0 2536     But, sure, he's proud; and yet his pride becomes him.
0 2537     He'll make a proper man. The best thing in him
0 2538     Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue
0 2539     Did make offence, his eye did heal it up.
0 2540     He is not very tall; yet for his years he's tall;
0 2541     His leg is but so-so; and yet 'tis well.
0 2542     There was a pretty redness in his lip,
0 2543     A little riper and more lusty red
0 2544     Than that mix'd in his cheek; 'twas just the difference
0 2545     Betwixt the constant red and mingled damask.
0 2546     There be some women, Silvius, had they mark'd him
0 2547     In parcels as I did, would have gone near
0 2548     To fall in love with him; but, for my part,
0 2549     I love him not, nor hate him not; and yet
0 2550     I have more cause to hate him than to love him;
0 2551     For what had he to do to chide at me?
0 2552     He said mine eyes were black, and my hair black,
0 2553     And, now I am rememb'red, scorn'd at me.
0 2554     I marvel why I answer'd not again;
0 2555     But that's all one: omittance is no quittance.
0 2556     I'll write to him a very taunting letter,
0 2557     And thou shalt bear it; wilt thou, Silvius?
0 2558 
0 2559   SILVIUS. Phebe, with all my heart.
0 2560 
0 2561   PHEBE. I'll write it straight;
0 2562     The matter's in my head and in my heart;
0 2563     I will be bitter with him and passing short.
0 2564     Go with me, Silvius.                                  Exeunt

0 2579 ACT IV. SCENE I.
0 2580 
0 2581 The forest
0 2582 
0 2583 Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and JAQUES
0 2584 
0 2585 
0 2586   JAQUES. I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted with
0 2587     thee.
0 2588 
0 2589   ROSALIND. They say you are a melancholy fellow.
0 2590 
0 2591   JAQUES. I am so; I do love it better than laughing.
0 2592 
0 2593   ROSALIND. Those that are in extremity of either are abominable
0 2594     fellows, and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than
0 2595     drunkards.
0 2596 
0 2597   JAQUES. Why, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing.
0 2598 
0 2599   ROSALIND. Why then, 'tis good to be a post.
0 2600 
0 2601   JAQUES. I have neither the scholar's melancholy, which is
0 2602     emulation; nor the musician's, which is fantastical; nor the
0 2603     courtier's, which is proud; nor the soldier's, which is
0 2604     ambitious; nor the lawyer's, which is politic; nor the lady's,
0 2605     which is nice; nor the lover's, which is all these; but it is a
0 2606     melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples, extracted
0 2607     from many objects, and, indeed, the sundry contemplation of my
0 2608     travels; in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous
0 2609     sadness.
0 2610 
0 2611   ROSALIND. A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to be
0 2612     sad. I fear you have sold your own lands to see other men's; then
0 2613     to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and
0 2614     poor hands.
0 2615 
0 2616   JAQUES. Yes, I have gain'd my experience.
0 2617 
0 2618                         Enter ORLANDO
0 2619 
0 2620 
0 2621   ROSALIND. And your experience makes you sad. I had rather have a
0 2622     fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad- and to
0 2623     travel for it too.
0 2624 
0 2625   ORLANDO. Good day, and happiness, dear Rosalind!
0 2626 
0 2627   JAQUES. Nay, then, God buy you, an you talk in blank verse.
0 2628 
0 2629   ROSALIND. Farewell, Monsieur Traveller; look you lisp and wear
0 2630     strange suits, disable all the benefits of your own country, be
0 2631     out of love with your nativity, and almost chide God for making
0 2632     you that countenance you are; or I will scarce think you have
0 2633     swam in a gondola. [Exit JAQUES] Why, how now, Orlando! where
0 2634     have you been all this while? You a lover! An you serve me such
0 2635     another trick, never come in my sight more.
0 2636 
0 2637   ORLANDO. My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.
0 2638 
0 2639   ROSALIND. Break an hour's promise in love! He that will divide a
0 2640     minute into a thousand parts, and break but a part of the
0 2641     thousand part of a minute in the affairs of love, it may be said
0 2642     of him that Cupid hath clapp'd him o' th' shoulder, but I'll
0 2643     warrant him heart-whole.
0 2644 
0 2645   ORLANDO. Pardon me, dear Rosalind.
0 2646 
0 2647   ROSALIND. Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight. I had
0 2648     as lief be woo'd of a snail.
0 2649 
0 2650   ORLANDO. Of a snail!
0 2651 
0 2652   ROSALIND. Ay, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he carries
0 2653     his house on his head- a better jointure, I think, than you make
0 2654     a woman; besides, he brings his destiny with him.
0 2655 
0 2656   ORLANDO. What's that?
0 2657 
0 2658   ROSALIND. Why, horns; which such as you are fain to be beholding to
0 2659     your wives for; but he comes armed in his fortune, and prevents
0 2660     the slander of his wife.
0 2661 
0 2662   ORLANDO. Virtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtuous.
0 2663 
0 2664   ROSALIND. And I am your Rosalind.
0 2665 
0 2666   CELIA. It pleases him to call you so; but he hath a Rosalind of a
0 2667     better leer than you.
0 2668 
0 2669   ROSALIND. Come, woo me, woo me; for now I am in a holiday humour,
0 2670     and like enough to consent. What would you say to me now, an I
0 2671     were your very very Rosalind?
0 2672 
0 2673   ORLANDO. I would kiss before I spoke.
0 2674 
0 2675   ROSALIND. Nay, you were better speak first; and when you were
0 2676     gravell'd for lack of matter, you might take occasion to kiss.
0 2677     Very good orators, when they are out, they will spit; and for
0 2678     lovers lacking- God warn us!- matter, the cleanliest shift is to
0 2679     kiss.
0 2680 
0 2681   ORLANDO. How if the kiss be denied?
0 2682 
0 2683   ROSALIND. Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new
0 2684     matter.
0 2685 
0 2686   ORLANDO. Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?
0 2687 
0 2688   ROSALIND. Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress; or I
0 2689     should think my honesty ranker than my wit.
0 2690 
0 2691   ORLANDO. What, of my suit?
0 2692 
0 2693   ROSALIND. Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit.
0 2694     Am not I your Rosalind?
0 2695 
0 2696   ORLANDO. I take some joy to say you are, because I would be talking
0 2697     of her.
0 2698 
0 2699   ROSALIND. Well, in her person, I say I will not have you.
0 2700 
0 2701   ORLANDO. Then, in mine own person, I die.
0 2702 
0 2703   ROSALIND. No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is almost six
0 2704     thousand years old, and in all this time there was not any man
0 2705     died in his own person, videlicet, in a love-cause. Troilus had
0 2706     his brains dash'd out with a Grecian club; yet he did what he
0 2707     could to die before, and he is one of the patterns of love.
0 2708     Leander, he would have liv'd many a fair year, though Hero had
0 2709     turn'd nun, if it had not been for a hot midsummer night; for,
0 2710     good youth, he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont, and,
0 2711     being taken with the cramp, was drown'd; and the foolish
0 2712     chroniclers of that age found it was- Hero of Sestos. But these
0 2713     are all lies: men have died from time to time, and worms have
0 2714     eaten them, but not for love.
0 2715 
0 2716   ORLANDO. I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind; for,
0 2717     I protest, her frown might kill me.
0 2718 
0 2719   ROSALIND. By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now I
0 2720     will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on disposition; and ask me
0 2721     what you will, I will grant it.
0 2722 
0 2723   ORLANDO. Then love me, Rosalind.
0 2724 
0 2725   ROSALIND. Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays, and all.
0 2726 
0 2727   ORLANDO. And wilt thou have me?
0 2728 
0 2729   ROSALIND. Ay, and twenty such.
0 2730 
0 2731   ORLANDO. What sayest thou?
0 2732 
0 2733   ROSALIND. Are you not good?
0 2734 
0 2735   ORLANDO. I hope so.
0 2736 
0 2737   ROSALIND. Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing?
0 2738     Come, sister, you shall be the priest, and marry us. Give me your hand,
0 2739     Orlando. What do you say, sister?
0 2740 
0 2741   ORLANDO. Pray thee, marry us.
0 2742 
0 2743   CELIA. I cannot say the words.
0 2744 
0 2745   ROSALIND. You must begin 'Will you, Orlando'-
0 2746 
0 2747   CELIA. Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?
0 2748 
0 2749   ORLANDO. I will.
0 2750 
0 2751   ROSALIND. Ay, but when?
0 2752 
0 2753   ORLANDO. Why, now; as fast as she can marry us.
0 2754 
0 2755   ROSALIND. Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'
0 2756 
0 2757   ORLANDO. I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.
0 2758 
0 2759   ROSALIND. I might ask you for your commission; but- I do take thee,
0 2760     Orlando, for my husband. There's a girl goes before the priest;
0 2761     and, certainly, a woman's thought runs before her actions.
0 2762 
0 2763   ORLANDO. So do all thoughts; they are wing'd.
0 2764 
0 2765   ROSALIND. Now tell me how long you would have her, after you have
0 2766     possess'd her.
0 2767 
0 2768   ORLANDO. For ever and a day.
0 2769 
0 2770   ROSALIND. Say 'a day' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando; men are
0 2771     April when they woo, December when they wed: maids are May when
0 2772     they are maids, but the sky changes when they are wives. I will
0 2773     be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen,
0 2774     more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more new-fangled than
0 2775     an ape, more giddy in my desires than a monkey. I will weep for
0 2776     nothing, like Diana in the fountain, and I will do that when you
0 2777     are dispos'd to be merry; I will laugh like a hyen, and that when
0 2778     thou are inclin'd to sleep.
0 2779 
0 2780   ORLANDO. But will my Rosalind do so?
0 2781 
0 2782   ROSALIND. By my life, she will do as I do.
0 2783 
0 2784   ORLANDO. O, but she is wise.
0 2785 
0 2786   ROSALIND. Or else she could not have the wit to do this. The wiser,
0 2787     the waywarder. Make the doors upon a woman's wit, and it will out
0 2788     at the casement; shut that, and 'twill out at the key-hole; stop
0 2789     that, 'twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney.
0 2790 
0 2791   ORLANDO. A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say 'Wit,
0 2792     whither wilt?' ROSALIND. Nay, you might keep that check for it, till you met your
0 2793     wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed.
0 2794 
0 2795   ORLANDO. And what wit could wit have to excuse that?
0 2796 
0 2797   ROSALIND. Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall never
0 2798     take her without her answer, unless you take her without her
0 2799     tongue. O, that woman that cannot make her fault her husband's
0 2800     occasion, let her never nurse her child herself, for she will
0 2801     breed it like a fool!
0 2802 
0 2803   ORLANDO. For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.
0 2804 
0 2805   ROSALIND. Alas, dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours!
0 2806 
0 2807   ORLANDO. I must attend the Duke at dinner; by two o'clock I will be
0 2808     with thee again.
0 2809 
0 2810   ROSALIND. Ay, go your ways, go your ways. I knew what you would
0 2811     prove; my friends told me as much, and I thought no less.
0 2812     That flattering tongue of yours won me. 'Tis but one cast away, and
0 2813     so, come death! Two o'clock is your hour?
0 2814 
0 2815   ORLANDO. Ay, sweet Rosalind.
0 2816 
0 2817   ROSALIND. By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend me, and
0 2818     by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous, if you break one jot
0 2819     of your promise, or come one minute behind your hour, I will
0 2820     think you the most pathetical break-promise, and the most hollow
0 2821     lover, and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind, that may
0 2822     be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful. Therefore
0 2823     beware my censure, and keep your promise.
0 2824 
0 2825   ORLANDO. With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my
0 2826     Rosalind; so, adieu.
0 2827 
0 2828   ROSALIND. Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such
0 2829     offenders, and let Time try. Adieu.             Exit ORLANDO
0 2830 
0 2831   CELIA. You have simply misus'd our sex in your love-prate. We must
0 2832     have your doublet and hose pluck'd over your head, and show the
0 2833     world what the bird hath done to her own nest.
0 2834 
0 2835   ROSALIND. O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou didst
0 2836     know how many fathom deep I am in love! But it cannot be sounded;
0 2837     my affection hath an unknown bottom, like the Bay of Portugal.
0 2838 
0 2839   CELIA. Or rather, bottomless; that as fast as you pour affection
0 2840     in, it runs out.
0 2841 
0 2842   ROSALIND. No; that same wicked bastard of Venus, that was begot of
0 2843     thought, conceiv'd of spleen, and born of madness; that blind
0 2844     rascally boy, that abuses every one's eyes, because his own are
0 2845     out- let him be judge how deep I am in love. I'll tell thee,
0 2846     Aliena, I cannot be out of the sight of Orlando. I'll go find a
0 2847     shadow, and sigh till he come.
0 2848 
0 2849   CELIA. And I'll sleep.                                  Exeunt
0 2850

0 2852 SCENE II.
0 2853 
0 2854 The forest
0 2855 
0 2856         Enter JAQUES and LORDS, in the habit of foresters
0 2857 
0 2858 
0 2859   JAQUES. Which is he that killed the deer?
0 2860 
0 2861   LORD. Sir, it was I.
0 2862 
0 2863   JAQUES. Let's present him to the Duke, like a Roman conqueror; and
0 2864     it would do well to set the deer's horns upon his head for a
0 2865     branch of victory. Have you no song, forester, for this purpose?
0 2866 
0 2867   LORD. Yes, sir.
0 2868 
0 2869   JAQUES. Sing it; 'tis no matter how it be in tune, so it make noise
0 2870     enough.
0 2871 
0 2872                     SONG.
0 2873 
0 2874       What shall he have that kill'd the deer?
0 2875       His leather skin and horns to wear.
0 2876                               [The rest shall hear this burden:]
0 2877            Then sing him home.
0 2878 
0 2879       Take thou no scorn to wear the horn;
0 2880       It was a crest ere thou wast born.
0 2881            Thy father's father wore it;
0 2882            And thy father bore it.
0 2883       The horn, the horn, the lusty horn,
0 2884       Is not a thing to laugh to scorn.                   Exeunt
0 2885 
0 2886 
0 2887 SCENE III.
0 2888 
0 2889 The forest
0 2890 
0 2891 Enter ROSALIND and CELIA
0 2892 
0 2893 
0 2894   ROSALIND. How say you now? Is it not past two o'clock?
0 2895     And here much Orlando!
0 2896 
0 2897   CELIA. I warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain, he hath
0 2898     ta'en his bow and arrows, and is gone forth- to sleep. Look, who
0 2899     comes here.
0 2900 
0 2901                       Enter SILVIUS
0 2902 
0 2903 
0 2904   SILVIUS. My errand is to you, fair youth;
0 2905     My gentle Phebe did bid me give you this.
0 2906     I know not the contents; but, as I guess
0 2907     By the stern brow and waspish action
0 2908     Which she did use as she was writing of it,
0 2909     It bears an angry tenour. Pardon me,
0 2910     I am but as a guiltless messenger.
0 2911 
0 2912   ROSALIND. Patience herself would startle at this letter,
0 2913     And play the swaggerer. Bear this, bear all.
0 2914     She says I am not fair, that I lack manners;
0 2915     She calls me proud, and that she could not love me,
0 2916     Were man as rare as Phoenix. 'Od's my will!
0 2917     Her love is not the hare that I do hunt;
0 2918     Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,
0 2919     This is a letter of your own device.
0 2920 
0 2921   SILVIUS. No, I protest, I know not the contents;
0 2922     Phebe did write it.
0 2923 
0 2924   ROSALIND. Come, come, you are a fool,
0 2925     And turn'd into the extremity of love.
0 2926     I saw her hand; she has a leathern hand,
0 2927     A freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think
0 2928     That her old gloves were on, but 'twas her hands;
0 2929     She has a huswife's hand- but that's no matter.
0 2930     I say she never did invent this letter:
0 2931     This is a man's invention, and his hand.
0 2932 
0 2933   SILVIUS. Sure, it is hers.
0 2934 
0 2935   ROSALIND. Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style;
0 2936     A style for challengers. Why, she defies me,
0 2937     Like Turk to Christian. Women's gentle brain
0 2938     Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention,
0 2939     Such Ethiope words, blacker in their effect
0 2940     Than in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?
0 2941 
0 2942   SILVIUS. So please you, for I never heard it yet;
0 2943     Yet heard too much of Phebe's cruelty.
0 2944 
0 2945   ROSALIND. She Phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes.
0 2946                                                          [Reads]
0 2947 
0 2948             'Art thou god to shepherd turn'd,
0 2949             That a maiden's heart hath burn'd?'
0 2950 
0 2951     Can a woman rail thus?
0 2952 
0 2953   SILVIUS. Call you this railing?
0 2954 
0 2955   ROSALIND. 'Why, thy godhead laid apart,
0 2956              Warr'st thou with a woman's heart?'
0 2957 
0 2958     Did you ever hear such railing?
0 2959 
0 2960             'Whiles the eye of man did woo me,
0 2961             That could do no vengeance to me.'
0 2962 
0 2963     Meaning me a beast.
0 2964 
0 2965             'If the scorn of your bright eyne
0 2966             Have power to raise such love in mine,
0 2967             Alack, in me what strange effect
0 2968             Would they work in mild aspect!
0 2969             Whiles you chid me, I did love;
0 2970             How then might your prayers move!
0 2971             He that brings this love to the
0 2972             Little knows this love in me;
0 2973             And by him seal up thy mind,
0 2974             Whether that thy youth and kind
0 2975             Will the faithful offer take
0 2976             Of me and all that I can make;
0 2977             Or else by him my love deny,
0 2978             And then I'll study how to die.'
0 2979 
0 2980   SILVIUS. Call you this chiding?
0 2981 
0 2982   CELIA. Alas, poor shepherd!
0 2983 
0 2984   ROSALIND. Do you pity him? No, he deserves no pity. Wilt thou love
0 2985     such a woman? What, to make thee an instrument, and play false
0 2986     strains upon thee! Not to be endur'd! Well, go your way to her,
0 2987     for I see love hath made thee tame snake, and say this to her-
0 2988     that if she love me, I charge her to love thee; if she will not,
0 2989     I will never have her unless thou entreat for her. If you be a
0 2990     true lover, hence, and not a word; for here comes more company.
0 2991                                                     Exit SILVIUS
0 2992 
0 2993                          Enter OLIVER
0 2994 
0 2995 
0 2996   OLIVER. Good morrow, fair ones; pray you, if you know,
0 2997     Where in the purlieus of this forest stands
0 2998     A sheep-cote fenc'd about with olive trees?
0 2999 
0 3000   CELIA. West of this place, down in the neighbour bottom.
0 3001     The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream
0 3002     Left on your right hand brings you to the place.
0 3003     But at this hour the house doth keep itself;
0 3004     There's none within.
0 3005 
0 3006   OLIVER. If that an eye may profit by a tongue,
0 3007     Then should I know you by description-
0 3008     Such garments, and such years: 'The boy is fair,
0 3009     Of female favour, and bestows himself
0 3010     Like a ripe sister; the woman low,
0 3011     And browner than her brother.' Are not you
0 3012     The owner of the house I did inquire for?
0 3013 
0 3014   CELIA. It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are.
0 3015 
0 3016   OLIVER. Orlando doth commend him to you both;
0 3017     And to that youth he calls his Rosalind
0 3018     He sends this bloody napkin. Are you he?
0 3019 
0 3020   ROSALIND. I am. What must we understand by this?
0 3021 
0 3022   OLIVER. Some of my shame; if you will know of me
0 3023     What man I am, and how, and why, and where,
0 3024     This handkercher was stain'd.
0 3025 
0 3026   CELIA. I pray you, tell it.
0 3027 
0 3028   OLIVER. When last the young Orlando parted from you,
0 3029     He left a promise to return again
0 3030     Within an hour; and, pacing through the forest,
0 3031     Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,
0 3032     Lo, what befell! He threw his eye aside,
0 3033     And mark what object did present itself.
0 3034     Under an oak, whose boughs were moss'd with age,
0 3035     And high top bald with dry antiquity,
0 3036     A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,
0 3037     Lay sleeping on his back. About his neck
0 3038     A green and gilded snake had wreath'd itself,
0 3039     Who with her head nimble in threats approach'd
0 3040     The opening of his mouth; but suddenly,
0 3041     Seeing Orlando, it unlink'd itself,
0 3042     And with indented glides did slip away
0 3043     Into a bush; under which bush's shade
0 3044     A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,
0 3045     Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch,
0 3046     When that the sleeping man should stir; for 'tis
0 3047     The royal disposition of that beast
0 3048     To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead.
0 3049     This seen, Orlando did approach the man,
0 3050     And found it was his brother, his elder brother.
0 3051 
0 3052   CELIA. O, I have heard him speak of that same brother;
0 3053     And he did render him the most unnatural
0 3054     That liv'd amongst men.
0 3055 
0 3056   OLIVER. And well he might so do,
0 3057     For well I know he was unnatural.
0 3058 
0 3059   ROSALIND. But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,
0 3060     Food to the suck'd and hungry lioness?
0 3061 
0 3062   OLIVER. Twice did he turn his back, and purpos'd so;
0 3063     But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,
0 3064     And nature, stronger than his just occasion,
0 3065     Made him give battle to the lioness,
0 3066     Who quickly fell before him; in which hurtling
0 3067     From miserable slumber I awak'd.
0 3068 
0 3069   CELIA. Are you his brother?
0 3070 
0 3071   ROSALIND. Was't you he rescu'd?
0 3072 
0 3073   CELIA. Was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?
0 3074 
0 3075   OLIVER. 'Twas I; but 'tis not I. I do not shame
0 3076     To tell you what I was, since my conversion
0 3077     So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.
0 3078 
0 3079   ROSALIND. But for the bloody napkin?
0 3080 
0 3081   OLIVER. By and by.
0 3082     When from the first to last, betwixt us two,
0 3083     Tears our recountments had most kindly bath'd,
0 3084     As how I came into that desert place-
0 3085     In brief, he led me to the gentle Duke,
0 3086     Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,
0 3087     Committing me unto my brother's love;
0 3088     Who led me instantly unto his cave,
0 3089     There stripp'd himself, and here upon his arm
0 3090     The lioness had torn some flesh away,
0 3091     Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted,
0 3092     And cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind.
0 3093     Brief, I recover'd him, bound up his wound,
0 3094     And, after some small space, being strong at heart,
0 3095     He sent me hither, stranger as I am,
0 3096     To tell this story, that you might excuse
0 3097     His broken promise, and to give this napkin,
0 3098     Dy'd in his blood, unto the shepherd youth
0 3099     That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.
0 3100                                                [ROSALIND swoons]
0 3101 
0 3102   CELIA. Why, how now, Ganymede! sweet Ganymede!
0 3103 
0 3104   OLIVER. Many will swoon when they do look on blood.
0 3105 
0 3106   CELIA. There is more in it. Cousin Ganymede!
0 3107 
0 3108   OLIVER. Look, he recovers.
0 3109 
0 3110   ROSALIND. I would I were at home.
0 3111 
0 3112   CELIA. We'll lead you thither.
0 3113     I pray you, will you take him by the arm?
0 3114 
0 3115   OLIVER. Be of good cheer, youth. You a man!
0 3116     You lack a man's heart.
0 3117 
0 3118   ROSALIND. I do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body would think
0 3119     this was well counterfeited. I pray you tell your brother how
0 3120     well I counterfeited. Heigh-ho!
0 3121 
0 3122   OLIVER. This was not counterfeit; there is too great testimony in
0 3123     your complexion that it was a passion of earnest.
0 3124 
0 3125   ROSALIND. Counterfeit, I assure you.
0 3126 
0 3127   OLIVER. Well then, take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man.
0 3128 
0 3129   ROSALIND. So I do; but, i' faith, I should have been a woman by
0 3130     right.
0 3131 
0 3132   CELIA. Come, you look paler and paler; pray you draw homewards.
0 3133     Good sir, go with us.
0 3134 
0 3135   OLIVER. That will I, for I must bear answer back
0 3136     How you excuse my brother, Rosalind.
0 3137 
0 3138   ROSALIND. I shall devise something; but, I pray you, commend my
0 3139     counterfeiting to him. Will you go?                   Exeunt

0 3156 The forest
0 3157 
0 3158 Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY
0 3159 
0 3160 
0 3161   TOUCHSTONE. We shall find a time, Audrey; patience, gentle Audrey.
0 3162 
0 3163   AUDREY. Faith, the priest was good enough, for all the old
0 3164     gentleman's saying.
0 3165 
0 3166   TOUCHSTONE. A most wicked Sir Oliver, Audrey, a most vile Martext.
0 3167     But, Audrey, there is a youth here in the forest lays claim to
0 3168     you.
0 3169 
0 3170   AUDREY. Ay, I know who 'tis; he hath no interest in me in the
0 3171     world; here comes the man you mean.
0 3172 
0 3173                          Enter WILLIAM
0 3174 
0 3175 
0 3176   TOUCHSTONE. It is meat and drink to me to see a clown. By my troth,
0 3177     we that have good wits have much to answer for: we shall be
0 3178     flouting; we cannot hold.
0 3179 
0 3180   WILLIAM. Good ev'n, Audrey.
0 3181 
0 3182   AUDREY. God ye good ev'n, William.
0 3183 
0 3184   WILLIAM. And good ev'n to you, sir.
0 3185 
0 3186   TOUCHSTONE. Good ev'n, gentle friend. Cover thy head, cover thy
0 3187     head; nay, prithee be cover'd. How old are you, friend?
0 3188 
0 3189   WILLIAM. Five and twenty, sir.
0 3190 
0 3191   TOUCHSTONE. A ripe age. Is thy name William?
0 3192 
0 3193   WILLIAM. William, sir.
0 3194 
0 3195   TOUCHSTONE. A fair name. Wast born i' th' forest here?
0 3196 
0 3197   WILLIAM. Ay, sir, I thank God.
0 3198 
0 3199   TOUCHSTONE. 'Thank God.' A good answer.
0 3200     Art rich?
0 3201 
0 3202   WILLIAM. Faith, sir, so so.
0 3203 
0 3204   TOUCHSTONE. 'So so' is good, very good, very excellent good; and
0 3205     yet it is not; it is but so so. Art thou wise?
0 3206 
0 3207   WILLIAM. Ay, sir, I have a pretty wit.
0 3208 
0 3209   TOUCHSTONE. Why, thou say'st well. I do now remember a saying:
0 3210 'The
0 3211     fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be
0 3212     a fool.' The heathen philosopher, when he had a desire to eat a
0 3213     grape, would open his lips when he put it into his mouth; meaning
0 3214     thereby that grapes were made to eat and lips to open. You do
0 3215     love this maid?
0 3216 
0 3217   WILLIAM. I do, sir.
0 3218 
0 3219   TOUCHSTONE. Give me your hand. Art thou learned?
0 3220 
0 3221   WILLIAM. No, sir.
0 3222 
0 3223   TOUCHSTONE. Then learn this of me: to have is to have; for it is a
0 3224     figure in rhetoric that drink, being pour'd out of cup into a
0 3225     glass, by filling the one doth empty the other; for all your
0 3226     writers do consent that ipse is he; now, you are not ipse, for I
0 3227     am he.
0 3228 
0 3229   WILLIAM. Which he, sir?
0 3230 
0 3231   TOUCHSTONE. He, sir, that must marry this woman. Therefore, you
0 3232     clown, abandon- which is in the vulgar leave- the society-which
0 3233     in the boorish is company- of this female- which in the common is
0 3234     woman- which together is: abandon the society of this female; or,
0 3235     clown, thou perishest; or, to thy better understanding, diest;
0 3236     or, to wit, I kill thee, make thee away, translate thy life into
0 3237     death, thy liberty into bondage. I will deal in poison with thee,
0 3238     or in bastinado, or in steel; I will bandy with thee in faction;
0 3239     will o'er-run thee with policy; I will kill thee a hundred and
0 3240     fifty ways; therefore tremble and depart.
0 3241 
0 3242   AUDREY. Do, good William.
0 3243 
0 3244   WILLIAM. God rest you merry, sir.                         Exit
0 3245 
0 3246 
0 3247                           Enter CORIN
0 3248 
0 3249 
0 3250   CORIN. Our master and mistress seeks you; come away, away.
0 3251 
0 3252   TOUCHSTONE. Trip, Audrey, trip, Audrey. I attend, I attend.
0 3253                                                           Exeunt
0 3254 
0 3255 
0 3256 SCENE II.
0 3257 
0 3258 The forest
0 3259 
0 3260 Enter ORLANDO and OLIVER
0 3261 
0 3262 
0 3263   ORLANDO. Is't possible that on so little acquaintance you should
0 3264     like her? that but seeing you should love her? and loving woo?
0 3265     and, wooing, she should grant? and will you persever to enjoy
0 3266     her?
0 3267 
0 3268   OLIVER. Neither call the giddiness of it in question, the poverty
0 3269     of her, the small acquaintance, my sudden wooing, nor her sudden
0 3270     consenting; but say with me, I love Aliena; say with her that she
0 3271     loves me; consent with both that we may enjoy each other. It
0 3272     shall be to your good; for my father's house and all the revenue
0 3273     that was old Sir Rowland's will I estate upon you, and here live
0 3274     and die a shepherd.
0 3275 
0 3276   ORLANDO. You have my consent. Let your wedding be to-morrow.
0 3277     Thither will I invite the Duke and all's contented followers.
0 3278     Go you and prepare Aliena; for, look you, here comes my Rosalind.
0 3279 
0 3280                         Enter ROSALIND
0 3281 
0 3282 
0 3283   ROSALIND. God save you, brother.
0 3284 
0 3285   OLIVER. And you, fair sister.                             Exit
0 3286 
0 3287   ROSALIND. O, my dear Orlando, how it grieves me to see thee wear
0 3288     thy heart in a scarf!
0 3289 
0 3290   ORLANDO. It is my arm.
0 3291 
0 3292   ROSALIND. I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a
0 3293     lion.
0 3294 
0 3295   ORLANDO. Wounded it is, but with the eyes of a lady.
0 3296 
0 3297   ROSALIND. Did your brother tell you how I counterfeited to swoon
0 3298     when he show'd me your handkercher?
0 3299 
0 3300   ORLANDO. Ay, and greater wonders than that.
0 3301 
0 3302   ROSALIND. O, I know where you are. Nay, 'tis true. There was never
0 3303     any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams and Caesar's
0 3304     thrasonical brag of 'I came, saw, and overcame.' For your brother
0 3305     and my sister no sooner met but they look'd; no sooner look'd but
0 3306     they lov'd; no sooner lov'd but they sigh'd; no sooner sigh'd but
0 3307     they ask'd one another the reason; no sooner knew the reason but
0 3308     they sought the remedy- and in these degrees have they made pair
0 3309     of stairs to marriage, which they will climb incontinent, or else
0 3310     be incontinent before marriage. They are in the very wrath of
0 3311 
0 3312 
0 3313     love, and they will together. Clubs cannot part them.
0 3314 
0 3315   ORLANDO. They shall be married to-morrow; and I will bid the Duke
0 3316     to the nuptial. But, O, how bitter a thing it is to look into
0 3317     happiness through another man's eyes! By so much the more shall I
0 3318     to-morrow be at the height of heart-heaviness, by how much I
0 3319     shall think my brother happy in having what he wishes for.
0 3320 
0 3321   ROSALIND. Why, then, to-morrow I cannot serve your turn for
0 3322     Rosalind?
0 3323 
0 3324   ORLANDO. I can live no longer by thinking.
0 3325 
0 3326   ROSALIND. I will weary you, then, no longer with idle talking.
0 3327     Know of me then- for now I speak to some purpose- that I know you are
0 3328     a gentleman of good conceit. I speak not this that you should
0 3329     bear a good opinion of my knowledge, insomuch I say I know you
0 3330     are; neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may in some
0 3331     little measure draw a belief from you, to do yourself good, and
0 3332     not to grace me. Believe then, if you please, that I can do
0 3333     strange things. I have, since I was three year old, convers'd
0 3334     with a magician, most profound in his art and yet not damnable.
0 3335     If you do love Rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries
0 3336     it out, when your brother marries Aliena shall you marry her.
0 3337     I know into what straits of fortune she is driven; and it is not
0 3338     impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient to you, to set
0 3339     her before your eyes to-morrow, human as she is, and without any
0 3340     danger.
0 3341 
0 3342   ORLANDO. Speak'st thou in sober meanings?
0 3343 
0 3344   ROSALIND. By my life, I do; which I tender dearly, though I say I
0 3345     am a magician. Therefore put you in your best array, bid your
0 3346     friends; for if you will be married to-morrow, you shall; and to
0 3347     Rosalind, if you will.
0 3348 
0 3349                      Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE
0 3350 
0 3351     Look, here comes a lover of mine, and a lover of hers.
0 3352 
0 3353   PHEBE. Youth, you have done me much ungentleness
0 3354     To show the letter that I writ to you.
0 3355 
0 3356   ROSALIND. I care not if I have. It is my study
0 3357     To seem despiteful and ungentle to you.
0 3358     You are there follow'd by a faithful shepherd;
0 3359     Look upon him, love him; he worships you.
0 3360 
0 3361   PHEBE. Good shepherd, tell this youth what 'tis to love.
0 3362 
0 3363   SILVIUS. It is to be all made of sighs and tears;
0 3364     And so am I for Phebe.
0 3365 
0 3366   PHEBE. And I for Ganymede.
0 3367 
0 3368   ORLANDO. And I for Rosalind.
0 3369 
0 3370   ROSALIND. And I for no woman.
0 3371 
0 3372   SILVIUS. It is to be all made of faith and service;
0 3373     And so am I for Phebe.
0 3374 
0 3375   PHEBE. And I for Ganymede.
0 3376 
0 3377   ORLANDO. And I for Rosalind.
0 3378 
0 3379   ROSALIND. And I for no woman.
0 3380 
0 3381   SILVIUS. It is to be all made of fantasy,
0 3382     All made of passion, and all made of wishes;
0 3383     All adoration, duty, and observance,
0 3384     All humbleness, all patience, and impatience,
0 3385     All purity, all trial, all obedience;
0 3386     And so am I for Phebe.
0 3387 
0 3388   PHEBE. And so am I for Ganymede.
0 3389 
0 3390   ORLANDO. And so am I for Rosalind.
0 3391 
0 3392   ROSALIND. And so am I for no woman.
0 3393 
0 3394   PHEBE. If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
0 3395 
0 3396   SILVIUS. If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
0 3397 
0 3398   ORLANDO. If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
0 3399 
0 3400   ROSALIND. Why do you speak too, 'Why blame you me to love you?'
0 3401 
0 3402   ORLANDO. To her that is not here, nor doth not hear.
0 3403 
0 3404   ROSALIND. Pray you, no more of this; 'tis like the howling of Irish
0 3405     wolves against the moon. [To SILVIUS] I will help you if I can.
0 3406     [To PHEBE] I would love you if I could.- To-morrow meet me all
0 3407     together. [ To PHEBE ] I will marry you if ever I marry woman,
0 3408     and I'll be married to-morrow. [To ORLANDO] I will satisfy you if
0 3409     ever I satisfied man, and you shall be married to-morrow. [To
0 3410     Silvius] I will content you if what pleases you contents you, and
0 3411     you shall be married to-morrow. [To ORLANDO] As you love
0 3412     Rosalind, meet. [To SILVIUS] As you love Phebe, meet;- and as I
0 3413     love no woman, I'll meet. So, fare you well; I have left you
0 3414     commands.
0 3415 
0 3416   SILVIUS. I'll not fail, if I live.
0 3417 
0 3418   PHEBE. Nor I.
0 3419 
0 3420   ORLANDO. Nor I.                                         Exeunt

0 3426 
0 3427 Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY
0 3428 
0 3429 
0 3430   TOUCHSTONE. To-morrow is the joyful day, Audre'y; to-morrow will we
0 3431     be married.
0 3432 
0 3433   AUDREY. I do desire it with all my heart; and I hope it is no
0 3434     dishonest desire to desire to be a woman of the world. Here come
0 3435     two of the banish'd Duke's pages.
0 3436 
0 3437                             Enter two PAGES
0 3438 
0 3439 
0 3440   FIRST PAGE. Well met, honest gentleman.
0 3441 
0 3442   TOUCHSTONE. By my troth, well met. Come sit, sit, and a song.
0 3443 
0 3444   SECOND PAGE. We are for you; sit i' th' middle.
0 3445 
0 3446   FIRST PAGE. Shall we clap into't roundly, without hawking, or
0 3447     spitting, or saying we are hoarse, which are the only prologues
0 3448     to a bad voice?
0 3449 
0 3450   SECOND PAGE. I'faith, i'faith; and both in a tune, like two gipsies
0 3451     on a horse.
0 3452 
0 3453                       SONG.
0 3454         It was a lover and his lass,
0 3455           With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
0 3456         That o'er the green corn-field did pass
0 3457           In the spring time, the only pretty ring time,
0 3458         When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding.
0 3459         Sweet lovers love the spring.
0 3460 
0 3461         Between the acres of the rye,
0 3462           With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
0 3463         These pretty country folks would lie,
0 3464           In the spring time, &c.
0 3465 
0 3466         This carol they began that hour,
0 3467           With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
0 3468         How that a life was but a flower,
0 3469           In the spring time, &c.
0 3470 
0 3471         And therefore take the present time,
0 3472           With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
0 3473         For love is crowned with the prime,
0 3474           In the spring time, &c.
0 3475 
0 3476 
0 3477   TOUCHSTONE. Truly, young gentlemen, though there was no great
0 3478     matter in the ditty, yet the note was very untuneable.
0 3479 
0 3480   FIRST PAGE. YOU are deceiv'd, sir; we kept time, we lost not our
0 3481     time.
0 3482 
0 3483   TOUCHSTONE. By my troth, yes; I count it but time lost to hear such
0 3484     a foolish song. God buy you; and God mend your voices. Come,
0 3485     Audrey.                                               Exeunt

0 3492 Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, JAQUES, ORLANDO, OLIVER, and CELIA
0 3493 
0 3494 
0 3495   DUKE SENIOR. Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy
0 3496     Can do all this that he hath promised?
0 3497 
0 3498   ORLANDO. I sometimes do believe and sometimes do not:
0 3499     As those that fear they hope, and know they fear.
0 3500 
0 3501                Enter ROSALIND, SILVIUS, and PHEBE
0 3502 
0 3503 
0 3504   ROSALIND. Patience once more, whiles our compact is urg'd:
0 3505     You say, if I bring in your Rosalind,
0 3506     You will bestow her on Orlando here?
0 3507 
0 3508   DUKE SENIOR. That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her.
0 3509 
0 3510   ROSALIND. And you say you will have her when I bring her?
0 3511 
0 3512   ORLANDO. That would I, were I of all kingdoms king.
0 3513 
0 3514   ROSALIND. You say you'll marry me, if I be willing?
0 3515 
0 3516   PHEBE. That will I, should I die the hour after.
0 3517 
0 3518   ROSALIND. But if you do refuse to marry me,
0 3519     You'll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?
0 3520 
0 3521   PHEBE. So is the bargain.
0 3522 
0 3523   ROSALIND. You say that you'll have Phebe, if she will?
0 3524 
0 3525   SILVIUS. Though to have her and death were both one thing.
0 3526 
0 3527   ROSALIND. I have promis'd to make all this matter even.
0 3528     Keep you your word, O Duke, to give your daughter;
0 3529     You yours, Orlando, to receive his daughter;
0 3530     Keep your word, Phebe, that you'll marry me,
0 3531     Or else, refusing me, to wed this shepherd;
0 3532     Keep your word, Silvius, that you'll marry her
0 3533     If she refuse me; and from hence I go,
0 3534     To make these doubts all even.
0 3535                                        Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA
0 3536 
0 3537   DUKE SENIOR. I do remember in this shepherd boy
0 3538     Some lively touches of my daughter's favour.
0 3539 
0 3540   ORLANDO. My lord, the first time that I ever saw him
0 3541     Methought he was a brother to your daughter.
0 3542     But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born,
0 3543     And hath been tutor'd in the rudiments
0 3544     Of many desperate studies by his uncle,
0 3545     Whom he reports to be a great magician,
0 3546     Obscured in the circle of this forest.
0 3547 
0 3548                     Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY
0 3549 
0 3550 
0 3551   JAQUES. There is, sure, another flood toward, and these couples are
0 3552     coming to the ark. Here comes a pair of very strange beasts which
0 3553     in all tongues are call'd fools.
0 3554 
0 3555   TOUCHSTONE. Salutation and greeting to you all!
0 3556 
0 3557   JAQUES. Good my lord, bid him welcome. This is the motley-minded
0 3558     gentleman that I have so often met in the forest. He hath been a
0 3559     courtier, he swears.
0 3560 
0 3561   TOUCHSTONE. If any man doubt that, let him put me to my purgation.
0 3562     I have trod a measure; I have flatt'red a lady; I have been
0 3563     politic with my friend, smooth with mine enemy; I have undone
0 3564     three tailors; I have had four quarrels, and like to have fought
0 3565     one.
0 3566 
0 3567   JAQUES. And how was that ta'en up?
0 3568 
0 3569   TOUCHSTONE. Faith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the
0 3570     seventh cause.
0 3571 
0 3572   JAQUES. How seventh cause? Good my lord, like this fellow.
0 3573 
0 3574   DUKE SENIOR. I like him very well.
0 3575 
0 3576   TOUCHSTONE. God 'ild you, sir; I desire you of the like. I press in
0 3577     here, sir, amongst the rest of the country copulatives, to swear
0 3578     and to forswear, according as marriage binds and blood breaks. A
0 3579     poor virgin, sir, an ill-favour'd thing, sir, but mine own; a
0 3580     poor humour of mine, sir, to take that that man else will.
0 3581     Rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a poor house; as your pearl
0 3582     in your foul oyster.
0 3583 
0 3584   DUKE SENIOR. By my faith, he is very swift and sententious.
0 3585 
0 3586   TOUCHSTONE. According to the fool's bolt, sir, and such dulcet
0 3587     diseases.
0 3588 
0 3589   JAQUES. But, for the seventh cause: how did you find the quarrel on
0 3590     the seventh cause?
0 3591 
0 3592   TOUCHSTONE. Upon a lie seven times removed- bear your body more
0 3593     seeming, Audrey- as thus, sir. I did dislike the cut of a certain
0 3594     courtier's beard; he sent me word, if I said his beard was not
0 3595     cut well, he was in the mind it was. This is call'd the Retort
0 3596     Courteous. If I sent him word again it was not well cut, he would
0 3597     send me word he cut it to please himself. This is call'd the Quip
0 3598     Modest. If again it was not well cut, he disabled my judgment.
0 3599     This is call'd the Reply Churlish. If again it was not well cut,
0 3600     he would answer I spake not true. This is call'd the Reproof
0 3601     Valiant. If again it was not well cut, he would say I lie.
0 3602     This is call'd the Countercheck Quarrelsome. And so to the Lie
0 3603     Circumstantial and the Lie Direct.
0 3604 
0 3605   JAQUES. And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?
0 3606 
0 3607   TOUCHSTONE. I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial, nor
0 3608     he durst not give me the Lie Direct; and so we measur'd swords
0 3609     and parted.
0 3610 
0 3611   JAQUES. Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?
0 3612 
0 3613   TOUCHSTONE. O, sir, we quarrel in print by the book, as you have
0 3614     books for good manners. I will name you the degrees. The first,
0 3615     the Retort Courteous; the second, the Quip Modest; the third, the
0 3616     Reply Churlish; the fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fifth, the
0 3617     Countercheck Quarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie with Circumstance;
0 3618     the seventh, the Lie Direct. All these you may avoid but the Lie
0 3619     Direct; and you may avoid that too with an If. I knew when seven
0 3620     justices could not take up a quarrel; but when the parties were
0 3621     met themselves, one of them thought but of an If, as: 'If you
0 3622     said so, then I said so.' And they shook hands, and swore
0 3623     brothers. Your If is the only peace-maker; much virtue in If.
0 3624 
0 3625   JAQUES. Is not this a rare fellow, my lord?
0 3626     He's as good at any thing, and yet a fool.
0 3627 
0 3628   DUKE SENIOR. He uses his folly like a stalking-horse, and under the
0 3629     presentation of that he shoots his wit:
0 3630 
0 3631           Enter HYMEN, ROSALIND, and CELIA. Still MUSIC
0 3632 
0 3633     HYMEN.    Then is there mirth in heaven,
0 3634               When earthly things made even
0 3635                 Atone together.
0 3636               Good Duke, receive thy daughter;
0 3637               Hymen from heaven brought her,
0 3638                 Yea, brought her hither,
0 3639               That thou mightst join her hand with his,
0 3640               Whose heart within his bosom is.
0 3641 
0 3642   ROSALIND. [To DUKE] To you I give myself, for I am yours.
0 3643     [To ORLANDO] To you I give myself, for I am yours.
0 3644 
0 3645   DUKE SENIOR. If there be truth in sight, you are my daughter.
0 3646 
0 3647   ORLANDO. If there be truth in sight, you are my Rosalind.
0 3648 
0 3649   PHEBE. If sight and shape be true,
0 3650     Why then, my love adieu!
0 3651 
0 3652   ROSALIND. I'll have no father, if you be not he;
0 3653     I'll have no husband, if you be not he;
0 3654     Nor ne'er wed woman, if you be not she.
0 3655 
0 3656   HYMEN.    Peace, ho! I bar confusion;
0 3657             'Tis I must make conclusion
0 3658               Of these most strange events.
0 3659             Here's eight that must take hands
0 3660             To join in Hymen's bands,
0 3661               If truth holds true contents.
0 3662             You and you no cross shall part;
0 3663             You and you are heart in heart;
0 3664             You to his love must accord,
0 3665             Or have a woman to your lord;
0 3666             You and you are sure together,
0 3667             As the winter to foul weather.
0 3668             Whiles a wedlock-hymn we sing,
0 3669             Feed yourselves with questioning,
0 3670             That reason wonder may diminish,
0 3671             How thus we met, and these things finish.
0 3672 
0 3673                        SONG
0 3674             Wedding is great Juno's crown;
0 3675               O blessed bond of board and bed!
0 3676             'Tis Hymen peoples every town;
0 3677               High wedlock then be honoured.
0 3678             Honour, high honour, and renown,
0 3679             To Hymen, god of every town!
0 3680 
0 3681 
0 3682   DUKE SENIOR. O my dear niece, welcome thou art to me!
0 3683     Even daughter, welcome in no less degree.
0 3684 
0 3685   PHEBE. I will not eat my word, now thou art mine;
0 3686     Thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine.
0 3687 
0 3688                  Enter JAQUES de BOYS
0 3689 
0 3690 
0 3691   JAQUES de BOYS. Let me have audience for a word or two.
0 3692     I am the second son of old Sir Rowland,
0 3693     That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.
0 3694     Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day
0 3695     Men of great worth resorted to this forest,
0 3696     Address'd a mighty power; which were on foot,
0 3697     In his own conduct, purposely to take
0 3698     His brother here, and put him to the sword;
0 3699     And to the skirts of this wild wood he came,
0 3700     Where, meeting with an old religious man,
0 3701     After some question with him, was converted
0 3702     Both from his enterprise and from the world;
0 3703     His crown bequeathing to his banish'd brother,
0 3704     And all their lands restor'd to them again
0 3705     That were with him exil'd. This to be true
0 3706     I do engage my life.
0 3707 
0 3708   DUKE SENIOR. Welcome, young man.
0 3709     Thou offer'st fairly to thy brothers' wedding:
0 3710     To one, his lands withheld; and to the other,
0 3711     A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.
0 3712     First, in this forest let us do those ends
0 3713     That here were well begun and well begot;
0 3714     And after, every of this happy number,
0 3715     That have endur'd shrewd days and nights with us,
0 3716     Shall share the good of our returned fortune,
0 3717     According to the measure of their states.
0 3718     Meantime, forget this new-fall'n dignity,
0 3719     And fall into our rustic revelry.
0 3720     Play, music; and you brides and bridegrooms all,
0 3721     With measure heap'd in joy, to th' measures fall.
0 3722 
0 3723   JAQUES. Sir, by your patience. If I heard you rightly,
0 3724     The Duke hath put on a religious life,
0 3725     And thrown into neglect the pompous court.
0 3726 
0 3727   JAQUES DE BOYS. He hath.
0 3728 
0 3729   JAQUES. To him will I. Out of these convertites
0 3730     There is much matter to be heard and learn'd.
0 3731     [To DUKE] You to your former honour I bequeath;
0 3732     Your patience and your virtue well deserves it.
0 3733     [To ORLANDO] You to a love that your true faith doth merit;
0 3734     [To OLIVER] You to your land, and love, and great allies
0 3735     [To SILVIUS] You to a long and well-deserved bed;
0 3736     [To TOUCHSTONE] And you to wrangling; for thy loving voyage
0 3737     Is but for two months victuall'd.- So to your pleasures;
0 3738     I am for other than for dancing measures.
0 3739 
0 3740   DUKE SENIOR. Stay, Jaques, stay.
0 3741 
0 3742   JAQUES. To see no pastime I. What you would have
0 3743     I'll stay to know at your abandon'd cave.               Exit
0 3744 
0 3745   DUKE SENIOR. Proceed, proceed. We will begin these rites,
0 3746     As we do trust they'll end, in true delights.    [A dance]
0 3747 
0 3748 Exeunt
0 3749 
0 3750 EPILOGUE
0 3751                            EPILOGUE.
0 3752 
0 3753   ROSALIND. It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue; but
0 3754     it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord the prologue.
0 3755     If it be true that good wine needs no bush, 'tis true that a good play
0 3756     needs no epilogue. Yet to good wine they do use good bushes; and
0 3757     good plays prove the better by the help of good epilogues.
0 3758     What a case am I in then, that am neither a good epilogue, nor cannot
0 3759     insinuate with you in the behalf of a good play! I am not
0 3760     furnish'd like a beggar; therefore to beg will not become me.
0 3761     My way is to conjure you; and I'll begin with the women. I charge
0 3762     you, O women, for the love you bear to men, to like as much of
0 3763     this play as please you; and I charge you, O men, for the love
0 3764     you bear to women- as I perceive by your simp'ring none of you
0 3765     hates them- that between you and the women the play may please.
0 3766     If I were a woman, I would kiss as many of you as had beards that
0 3767     pleas'd me, complexions that lik'd me, and breaths that I defied
0 3768     not; and, I am sure, as many as have good beards, or good faces,
0 3769     or sweet breaths, will, for my kind offer, when I make curtsy,
0 3770     bid me farewell.

0 4059 Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
0 4060 
0 4061 Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
0 4062 electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
0 4063 including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
0 4064 because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
0 4065 people in all walks of life.
0 4066 
0 4067 Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
0 4068 assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
0 4069 goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
0 4070 remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
0 4071 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
0 4072 and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

0 4104 Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
0 4105 Literary Archive Foundation
0 4106 
0 4107 Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
0 4108 spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
0 4109 increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
0 4110 freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
0 4111 array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
0 4112 ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
0 4113 status with the IRS.
0 4114 
0 4115 The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
0 4116 charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
0 4117 States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
0 4118 considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
0 4119 with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
0 4120 where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
0 4121 SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
0 4122 particular state visit http://pglaf.org
0 4123 
0 4124 While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
0 4125 have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
0 4126 against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
0 4127 approach us with offers to donate.
0 4128 
0 4129 International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
0 4130 any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
0 4131 outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
0 4132 
0 4133 Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
0 4134 methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
0 4135 ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

0 4139 Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
0 4140 works.
0 4141 
0 4142 Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
0 4143 concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
0 4144 with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
0 4145 Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
0 4146 
0 4147 
0 4148 Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
0 4149 editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
0 4150 unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
0 4151 keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
