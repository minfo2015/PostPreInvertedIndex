13 0 The Tragedie of Julius Caesar
13 1 
13 2 Actus Primus. Scoena Prima.
13 3 
13 4 Enter Flauius, Murellus, and certaine Commoners ouer the Stage.
13 5 
13 6   Flauius. Hence: home you idle Creatures, get you home:
13 7 Is this a Holiday? What, know you not
13 8 (Being Mechanicall) you ought not walke
13 9 Vpon a labouring day, without the signe
13 10 Of your Profession? Speake, what Trade art thou?
13 11   Car. Why Sir, a Carpenter
13 12 
13 13    Mur. Where is thy Leather Apron, and thy Rule?
13 14 What dost thou with thy best Apparrell on?
13 15 You sir, what Trade are you?
13 16   Cobl. Truely Sir, in respect of a fine Workman, I am
13 17 but as you would say, a Cobler
13 18 
13 19    Mur. But what Trade art thou? Answer me directly
13 20 
13 21    Cob. A Trade Sir, that I hope I may vse, with a safe
13 22 Conscience, which is indeed Sir, a Mender of bad soules
13 23 
13 24    Fla. What Trade thou knaue? Thou naughty knaue,
13 25 what Trade?
13 26   Cobl. Nay I beseech you Sir, be not out with me: yet
13 27 if you be out Sir, I can mend you
13 28 
13 29    Mur. What mean'st thou by that? Mend mee, thou
13 30 sawcy Fellow?
13 31   Cob. Why sir, Cobble you
13 32 
13 33    Fla. Thou art a Cobler, art thou?
13 34   Cob. Truly sir, all that I liue by, is with the Aule: I
13 35 meddle with no Tradesmans matters, nor womens matters;
13 36 but withal I am indeed Sir, a Surgeon to old shooes:
13 37 when they are in great danger, I recouer them. As proper
13 38 men as euer trod vpon Neats Leather, haue gone vpon
13 39 my handy-worke
13 40 
13 41    Fla. But wherefore art not in thy Shop to day?
13 42 Why do'st thou leade these men about the streets?
13 43   Cob. Truly sir, to weare out their shooes, to get my
13 44 selfe into more worke. But indeede sir, we make Holyday
13 45 to see Caesar, and to reioyce in his Triumph
13 46 
13 47    Mur. Wherefore reioyce?
13 48 What Conquest brings he home?
13 49 What Tributaries follow him to Rome,
13 50 To grace in Captiue bonds his Chariot Wheeles?
13 51 You Blockes, you stones, you worse then senslesse things:
13 52 O you hard hearts, you cruell men of Rome,
13 53 Knew you not Pompey many a time and oft?
13 54 Haue you climb'd vp to Walles and Battlements,
13 55 To Towres and Windowes? Yea, to Chimney tops,
13 56 Your Infants in your Armes, and there haue sate
13 57 The liue-long day, with patient expectation,
13 58 To see great Pompey passe the streets of Rome:
13 59 And when you saw his Chariot but appeare,
13 60 Haue you not made an Vniuersall shout,
13 61 That Tyber trembled vnderneath her bankes
13 62 To heare the replication of your sounds,
13 63 Made in her Concaue Shores?
13 64 And do you now put on your best attyre?
13 65 And do you now cull out a Holyday?
13 66 And do you now strew Flowers in his way,
13 67 That comes in Triumph ouer Pompeyes blood?
13 68 Be gone,
13 69 Runne to your houses, fall vpon your knees,
13 70 Pray to the Gods to intermit the plague
13 71 That needs must light on this Ingratitude
13 72 
13 73    Fla. Go, go, good Countrymen, and for this fault
13 74 Assemble all the poore men of your sort;
13 75 Draw them to Tyber bankes, and weepe your teares
13 76 Into the Channell, till the lowest streame
13 77 Do kisse the most exalted Shores of all.
13 78 
13 79 Exeunt. all the Commoners.
13 80 
13 81 See where their basest mettle be not mou'd,
13 82 They vanish tongue-tyed in their guiltinesse:
13 83 Go you downe that way towards the Capitoll,
13 84 This way will I: Disrobe the Images,
13 85 If you do finde them deckt with Ceremonies
13 86 
13 87    Mur. May we do so?
13 88 You know it is the Feast of Lupercall
13 89 
13 90    Fla. It is no matter, let no Images
13 91 Be hung with Caesars Trophees: Ile about,
13 92 And driue away the Vulgar from the streets;
13 93 So do you too, where you perceiue them thicke.
13 94 These growing Feathers, pluckt from Caesars wing,
13 95 Will make him flye an ordinary pitch,
13 96 Who else would soare aboue the view of men,
13 97 And keepe vs all in seruile fearefulnesse.
13 98 
13 99 Exeunt.
13 100 
13 101 Enter Caesar, Antony for the Course, Calphurnia, Portia, Decius,
13 102 Cicero,
13 103 Brutus, Cassius, Caska, a Soothsayer: after them Murellus and
13 104 Flauius.
13 105 
13 106   Caes. Calphurnia
13 107 
13 108    Cask. Peace ho, Caesar speakes
13 109 
13 110    Caes. Calphurnia
13 111 
13 112    Calp. Heere my Lord
13 113 
13 114    Caes. Stand you directly in Antonio's way,
13 115 When he doth run his course. Antonio
13 116 
13 117    Ant. CÃ¦sar, my Lord
13 118 
13 119    Caes. Forget not in your speed Antonio,
13 120 To touch Calphurnia: for our Elders say,
13 121 The Barren touched in this holy chace,
13 122 Shake off their sterrile curse
13 123 
13 124    Ant. I shall remember,
13 125 When Caesar sayes, Do this; it is perform'd
13 126 
13 127    Caes. Set on, and leaue no Ceremony out
13 128 
13 129    Sooth. Caesar
13 130 
13 131    Caes. Ha? Who calles?
13 132   Cask. Bid euery noyse be still: peace yet againe
13 133 
13 134    Caes. Who is it in the presse, that calles on me?
13 135 I heare a Tongue shriller then all the Musicke
13 136 Cry, Caesar: Speake, Caesar is turn'd to heare
13 137 
13 138    Sooth. Beware the Ides of March
13 139 
13 140    Caes. What man is that?
13 141   Br. A Sooth-sayer bids you beware the Ides of March
13 142   Caes. Set him before me, let me see his face
13 143 
13 144    Cassi. Fellow, come from the throng, look vpon Caesar
13 145 
13 146    Caes. What sayst thou to me now? Speak once againe,
13 147   Sooth. Beware the Ides of March
13 148 
13 149    Caes. He is a Dreamer, let vs leaue him: Passe.
13 150 
13 151 Sennet
13 152 
13 153 Exeunt. Manet Brut. & Cass.
13 154 
13 155   Cassi. Will you go see the order of the course?
13 156   Brut. Not I
13 157 
13 158    Cassi. I pray you do
13 159 
13 160    Brut. I am not Gamesom: I do lacke some part
13 161 Of that quicke Spirit that is in Antony:
13 162 Let me not hinder Cassius your desires;
13 163 Ile leaue you
13 164 
13 165    Cassi. Brutus, I do obserue you now of late:
13 166 I haue not from your eyes, that gentlenesse
13 167 And shew of Loue, as I was wont to haue:
13 168 You beare too stubborne, and too strange a hand
13 169 Ouer your Friend, that loues you
13 170 
13 171    Bru. Cassius,
13 172 Be not deceiu'd: If I haue veyl'd my looke,
13 173 I turne the trouble of my Countenance
13 174 Meerely vpon my selfe. Vexed I am
13 175 Of late, with passions of some difference,
13 176 Conceptions onely proper to my selfe,
13 177 Which giue some soyle (perhaps) to my Behauiours:
13 178 But let not therefore my good Friends be greeu'd
13 179 (Among which number Cassius be you one)
13 180 Nor construe any further my neglect,
13 181 Then that poore Brutus with himselfe at warre,
13 182 Forgets the shewes of Loue to other men
13 183 
13 184    Cassi. Then Brutus, I haue much mistook your passion,
13 185 By meanes whereof, this Brest of mine hath buried
13 186 Thoughts of great value, worthy Cogitations.
13 187 Tell me good Brutus, Can you see your face?
13 188   Brutus. No Cassius:
13 189 For the eye sees not it selfe but by reflection,
13 190 By some other things
13 191 
13 192    Cassius. 'Tis iust,
13 193 And it is very much lamented Brutus,
13 194 That you haue no such Mirrors, as will turne
13 195 Your hidden worthinesse into your eye,
13 196 That you might see your shadow:
13 197 I haue heard,
13 198 Where many of the best respect in Rome,
13 199 (Except immortall Caesar) speaking of Brutus,
13 200 And groaning vnderneath this Ages yoake,
13 201 Haue wish'd, that Noble Brutus had his eyes
13 202 
13 203    Bru. Into what dangers, would you
13 204 Leade me Cassius?
13 205 That you would haue me seeke into my selfe,
13 206 For that which is not in me?
13 207   Cas. Therefore good Brutus, be prepar'd to heare:
13 208 And since you know, you cannot see your selfe
13 209 So well as by Reflection; I your Glasse,
13 210 Will modestly discouer to your selfe
13 211 That of your selfe, which you yet know not of.
13 212 And be not iealous on me, gentle Brutus:
13 213 Were I a common Laughter, or did vse
13 214 To stale with ordinary Oathes my loue
13 215 To euery new Protester: if you know,
13 216 That I do fawne on men, and hugge them hard,
13 217 And after scandall them: Or if you know,
13 218 That I professe my selfe in Banquetting
13 219 To all the Rout, then hold me dangerous.
13 220 
13 221 Flourish, and Shout.
13 222 
13 223   Bru. What meanes this Showting?
13 224 I do feare, the People choose Caesar
13 225 For their King
13 226 
13 227    Cassi. I, do you feare it?
13 228 Then must I thinke you would not haue it so
13 229 
13 230    Bru. I would not Cassius, yet I loue him well:
13 231 But wherefore do you hold me heere so long?
13 232 What is it, that you would impart to me?
13 233 If it be ought toward the generall good,
13 234 Set Honor in one eye, and Death i'th other,
13 235 And I will looke on both indifferently:
13 236 For let the Gods so speed mee, as I loue
13 237 The name of Honor, more then I feare death
13 238 
13 239    Cassi. I know that vertue to be in you Brutus,
13 240 As well as I do know your outward fauour.
13 241 Well, Honor is the subiect of my Story:
13 242 I cannot tell, what you and other men
13 243 Thinke of this life: But for my single selfe,
13 244 I had as liefe not be, as liue to be
13 245 In awe of such a Thing, as I my selfe.
13 246 I was borne free as Caesar, so were you,
13 247 We both haue fed as well, and we can both
13 248 Endure the Winters cold, as well as hee.
13 249 For once, vpon a Rawe and Gustie day,
13 250 The troubled Tyber, chafing with her Shores,
13 251 Caesar saide to me, Dar'st thou Cassius now
13 252 Leape in with me into this angry Flood,
13 253 And swim to yonder Point? Vpon the word,
13 254 Accoutred as I was, I plunged in,
13 255 And bad him follow: so indeed he did.
13 256 The Torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it
13 257 With lusty Sinewes, throwing it aside,
13 258 And stemming it with hearts of Controuersie.
13 259 But ere we could arriue the Point propos'd,
13 260 Caesar cride, Helpe me Cassius, or I sinke.
13 261 I (as Aeneas, our great Ancestor,
13 262 Did from the Flames of Troy, vpon his shoulder
13 263 The old Anchyses beare) so, from the waues of Tyber
13 264 Did I the tyred Caesar: And this Man,
13 265 Is now become a God, and Cassius is
13 266 A wretched Creature, and must bend his body,
13 267 If Caesar carelesly but nod on him.
13 268 He had a Feauer when he was in Spaine,
13 269 And when the Fit was on him, I did marke
13 270 How he did shake: Tis true, this God did shake,
13 271 His Coward lippes did from their colour flye,
13 272 And that same Eye, whose bend doth awe the World,
13 273 Did loose his Lustre: I did heare him grone:
13 274 I, and that Tongue of his, that bad the Romans
13 275 Marke him, and write his Speeches in their Bookes,
13 276 Alas, it cried, Giue me some drinke Titinius,
13 277 As a sicke Girle: Ye Gods, it doth amaze me,
13 278 A man of such a feeble temper should
13 279 So get the start of the Maiesticke world,
13 280 And beare the Palme alone.
13 281 
13 282 Shout. Flourish.
13 283 
13 284   Bru. Another generall shout?
13 285 I do beleeue, that these applauses are
13 286 For some new Honors, that are heap'd on Caesar
13 287 
13 288    Cassi. Why man, he doth bestride the narrow world
13 289 Like a Colossus, and we petty men
13 290 Walke vnder his huge legges, and peepe about
13 291 To finde our selues dishonourable Graues.
13 292 Men at sometime, are Masters of their Fates.
13 293 The fault (deere Brutus) is not in our Starres,
13 294 But in our Selues, that we are vnderlings.
13 295 Brutus and Caesar: What should be in that Caesar?
13 296 Why should that name be sounded more then yours
13 297 Write them together: Yours, is as faire a Name:
13 298 Sound them, it doth become the mouth aswell:
13 299 Weigh them, it is as heauy: Coniure with 'em,
13 300 Brutus will start a Spirit as soone as Caesar.
13 301 Now in the names of all the Gods at once,
13 302 Vpon what meate doth this our Caesar feede,
13 303 That he is growne so great? Age, thou art sham'd.
13 304 Rome, thou hast lost the breed of Noble Bloods.
13 305 When went there by an Age, since the great Flood,
13 306 But it was fam'd with more then with one man?
13 307 When could they say (till now) that talk'd of Rome,
13 308 That her wide Walkes incompast but one man?
13 309 Now is it Rome indeed, and Roome enough
13 310 When there is in it but one onely man.
13 311 O! you and I, haue heard our Fathers say,
13 312 There was a Brutus once, that would haue brook'd
13 313 Th' eternall Diuell to keepe his State in Rome,
13 314 As easily as a King
13 315 
13 316    Bru. That you do loue me, I am nothing iealous:
13 317 What you would worke me too, I haue some ayme:
13 318 How I haue thought of this, and of these times
13 319 I shall recount heereafter. For this present,
13 320 I would not so (with loue I might intreat you)
13 321 Be any further moou'd: What you haue said,
13 322 I will consider: what you haue to say
13 323 I will with patience heare, and finde a time
13 324 Both meete to heare, and answer such high things.
13 325 Till then, my Noble Friend, chew vpon this:
13 326 Brutus had rather be a Villager,
13 327 Then to repute himselfe a Sonne of Rome
13 328 Vnder these hard Conditions, as this time
13 329 Is like to lay vpon vs
13 330 
13 331    Cassi. I am glad that my weake words
13 332 Haue strucke but thus much shew of fire from Brutus,
13 333 Enter Caesar and his Traine.
13 334 
13 335   Bru. The Games are done,
13 336 And Caesar is returning
13 337 
13 338    Cassi. As they passe by,
13 339 Plucke Caska by the Sleeue,
13 340 And he will (after his sowre fashion) tell you
13 341 What hath proceeded worthy note to day
13 342 
13 343    Bru. I will do so: but looke you Cassius,
13 344 The angry spot doth glow on Caesars brow,
13 345 And all the rest, looke like a chidden Traine;
13 346 Calphurnia's Cheeke is pale, and Cicero
13 347 Lookes with such Ferret, and such fiery eyes
13 348 As we haue seene him in the Capitoll
13 349 Being crost in Conference, by some Senators
13 350 
13 351    Cassi. Caska will tell vs what the matter is
13 352 
13 353    Caes Antonio
13 354 
13 355    Ant. Caesar
13 356 
13 357    Caes Let me haue men about me, that are fat,
13 358 Sleeke-headed men, and such as sleepe a-nights:
13 359 Yond Cassius has a leane and hungry looke,
13 360 He thinkes too much: such men are dangerous
13 361 
13 362    Ant. Feare him not Caesar, he's not dangerous,
13 363 He is a Noble Roman, and well giuen
13 364 
13 365    Caes Would he were fatter; But I feare him not:
13 366 Yet if my name were lyable to feare,
13 367 I do not know the man I should auoyd
13 368 So soone as that spare Cassius. He reades much,
13 369 He is a great Obseruer, and he lookes
13 370 Quite through the Deeds of men. He loues no Playes,
13 371 As thou dost Antony: he heares no Musicke;
13 372 Seldome he smiles, and smiles in such a sort
13 373 As if he mock'd himselfe, and scorn'd his spirit
13 374 That could be mou'd to smile at any thing.
13 375 Such men as he, be neuer at hearts ease,
13 376 Whiles they behold a greater then themselues,
13 377 And therefore are they very dangerous.
13 378 I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd,
13 379 Then what I feare: for alwayes I am Caesar.
13 380 Come on my right hand, for this eare is deafe,
13 381 And tell me truely, what thou think'st of him.
13 382 
13 383 Sennit.
13 384 
13 385 Exeunt. Caesar and his Traine.
13 386 
13 387   Cask. You pul'd me by the cloake, would you speake
13 388 with me?
13 389   Bru. I Caska, tell vs what hath chanc'd to day
13 390 That Caesar lookes so sad
13 391 
13 392    Cask. Why you were with him, were you not?
13 393   Bru. I should not then aske Caska what had chanc'd
13 394 
13 395    Cask. Why there was a Crowne offer'd him; & being
13 396 offer'd him, he put it by with the backe of his hand thus,
13 397 and then the people fell a shouting
13 398 
13 399    Bru. What was the second noyse for?
13 400   Cask. Why for that too
13 401 
13 402    Cassi. They shouted thrice: what was the last cry for?
13 403   Cask. Why for that too
13 404 
13 405    Bru. Was the Crowne offer'd him thrice?
13 406   Cask. I marry was't, and hee put it by thrice, euerie
13 407 time gentler then other; and at euery putting by, mine
13 408 honest Neighbors showted
13 409 
13 410    Cassi. Who offer'd him the Crowne?
13 411   Cask. Why Antony
13 412 
13 413    Bru. Tell vs the manner of it, gentle Caska
13 414 
13 415    Caska. I can as well bee hang'd as tell the manner of
13 416 it: It was meere Foolerie, I did not marke it. I sawe
13 417 Marke Antony offer him a Crowne, yet 'twas not a
13 418 Crowne neyther, 'twas one of these Coronets: and as I
13 419 told you, hee put it by once: but for all that, to my thinking,
13 420 he would faine haue had it. Then hee offered it to
13 421 him againe: then hee put it by againe: but to my thinking,
13 422 he was very loath to lay his fingers off it. And then
13 423 he offered it the third time; hee put it the third time by,
13 424 and still as hee refus'd it, the rabblement howted, and
13 425 clapp'd their chopt hands, and threw vppe their sweatie
13 426 Night-cappes, and vttered such a deale of stinking
13 427 breath, because Caesar refus'd the Crowne, that it had
13 428 (almost) choaked Caesar: for hee swoonded, and fell
13 429 downe at it: And for mine owne part, I durst not laugh,
13 430 for feare of opening my Lippes, and receyuing the bad
13 431 Ayre
13 432 
13 433    Cassi. But soft I pray you: what, did Caesar swound?
13 434   Cask. He fell downe in the Market-place, and foam'd
13 435 at mouth, and was speechlesse
13 436 
13 437    Brut. 'Tis very like he hath the Falling sicknesse
13 438 
13 439    Cassi. No, Caesar hath it not: but you, and I,
13 440 And honest Caska, we haue the Falling sicknesse
13 441 
13 442    Cask. I know not what you meane by that, but I am
13 443 sure Caesar fell downe. If the tag-ragge people did not
13 444 clap him, and hisse him, according as he pleas'd, and displeas'd
13 445 them, as they vse to doe the Players in the Theatre,
13 446 I am no true man
13 447 
13 448    Brut. What said he, when he came vnto himselfe?
13 449   Cask. Marry, before he fell downe, when he perceiu'd
13 450 the common Heard was glad he refus'd the Crowne, he
13 451 pluckt me ope his Doublet, and offer'd them his Throat
13 452 to cut: and I had beene a man of any Occupation, if I
13 453 would not haue taken him at a word, I would I might
13 454 goe to Hell among the Rogues, and so hee fell. When
13 455 he came to himselfe againe, hee said, If hee had done, or
13 456 said any thing amisse, he desir'd their Worships to thinke
13 457 it was his infirmitie. Three or foure Wenches where I
13 458 stood, cryed, Alasse good Soule, and forgaue him with
13 459 all their hearts: But there's no heed to be taken of them;
13 460 if Caesar had stab'd their Mothers, they would haue done
13 461 no lesse
13 462 
13 463    Brut. And after that, he came thus sad away
13 464 
13 465    Cask. I
13 466 
13 467    Cassi. Did Cicero say any thing?
13 468   Cask. I, he spoke Greeke
13 469 
13 470    Cassi. To what effect?
13 471   Cask. Nay, and I tell you that, Ile ne're looke you
13 472 i'th' face againe. But those that vnderstood him, smil'd
13 473 at one another, and shooke their heads: but for mine
13 474 owne part, it was Greeke to me. I could tell you more
13 475 newes too: Murrellus and Flauius, for pulling Scarffes
13 476 off Caesars Images, are put to silence. Fare you well.
13 477 There was more Foolerie yet, if I could remember
13 478 it
13 479 
13 480    Cassi. Will you suppe with me to Night, Caska?
13 481   Cask. No, I am promis'd forth
13 482 
13 483    Cassi. Will you Dine with me to morrow?
13 484   Cask. I, if I be aliue, and your minde hold, and your
13 485 Dinner worth the eating
13 486 
13 487    Cassi. Good, I will expect you
13 488 
13 489    Cask. Doe so: farewell both.
13 490 Enter.
13 491 
13 492   Brut. What a blunt fellow is this growne to be?
13 493 He was quick Mettle, when he went to Schoole
13 494 
13 495    Cassi. So is he now, in execution
13 496 Of any bold, or Noble Enterprize,
13 497 How-euer he puts on this tardie forme:
13 498 This Rudenesse is a Sawce to his good Wit,
13 499 Which giues men stomacke to disgest his words
13 500 With better Appetite
13 501 
13 502    Brut. And so it is:
13 503 For this time I will leaue you:
13 504 To morrow, if you please to speake with me,
13 505 I will come home to you: or if you will,
13 506 Come home to me, and I will wait for you
13 507 
13 508    Cassi. I will doe so: till then, thinke of the World.
13 509 Exit Brutus.
13 510 
13 511 Well Brutus, thou art Noble: yet I see,
13 512 Thy Honorable Mettle may be wrought
13 513 From that it is dispos'd: therefore it is meet,
13 514 That Noble mindes keepe euer with their likes:
13 515 For who so firme, that cannot be seduc'd?
13 516 Caesar doth beare me hard, but he loues Brutus.
13 517 If I were Brutus now, and he were Cassius,
13 518 He should not humor me. I will this Night,
13 519 In seuerall Hands, in at his Windowes throw,
13 520 As if they came from seuerall Citizens,
13 521 Writings, all tending to the great opinion
13 522 That Rome holds of his Name: wherein obscurely
13 523 Caesars Ambition shall be glanced at.
13 524 And after this, let Caesar seat him sure,
13 525 For wee will shake him, or worse dayes endure.
13 526 Enter.
13 527 
13 528 Thunder, and Lightning. Enter Caska, and Cicero.
13 529 
13 530   Cic. Good euen, Caska: brought you Caesar home?
13 531 Why are you breathlesse, and why stare you so?
13 532   Cask. Are not you mou'd, when all the sway of Earth
13 533 Shakes, like a thing vnfirme? O Cicero,
13 534 I haue seene Tempests, when the scolding Winds
13 535 Haue riu'd the knottie Oakes, and I haue seene
13 536 Th' ambitious Ocean swell, and rage, and foame,
13 537 To be exalted with the threatning Clouds:
13 538 But neuer till to Night, neuer till now,
13 539 Did I goe through a Tempest-dropping-fire.
13 540 Eyther there is a Ciuill strife in Heauen,
13 541 Or else the World, too sawcie with the Gods,
13 542 Incenses them to send destruction
13 543 
13 544    Cic. Why, saw you any thing more wonderfull?
13 545   Cask. A common slaue, you know him well by sight,
13 546 Held vp his left Hand, which did flame and burne
13 547 Like twentie Torches ioyn'd; and yet his Hand,
13 548 Not sensible of fire, remain'd vnscorch'd.
13 549 Besides, I ha' not since put vp my Sword,
13 550 Against the Capitoll I met a Lyon,
13 551 Who glaz'd vpon me, and went surly by,
13 552 Without annoying me. And there were drawne
13 553 Vpon a heape, a hundred gastly Women,
13 554 Transformed with their feare, who swore, they saw
13 555 Men, all in fire, walke vp and downe the streetes.
13 556 And yesterday, the Bird of Night did sit,
13 557 Euen at Noone-day, vpon the Market place,
13 558 Howting, and shreeking. When these Prodigies
13 559 Doe so conioyntly meet, let not men say,
13 560 These are their Reasons, they are Naturall:
13 561 For I beleeue, they are portentous things
13 562 Vnto the Clymate, that they point vpon
13 563 
13 564    Cic. Indeed, it is a strange disposed time:
13 565 But men may construe things after their fashion,
13 566 Cleane from the purpose of the things themselues.
13 567 Comes Caesar to the Capitoll to morrow?
13 568   Cask. He doth: for he did bid Antonio
13 569 Send word to you, he would be there to morrow
13 570 
13 571    Cic. Good-night then, Caska:
13 572 This disturbed Skie is not to walke in
13 573 
13 574    Cask. Farewell Cicero.
13 575 
13 576 Exit Cicero.
13 577 
13 578 Enter Cassius.
13 579 
13 580   Cassi. Who's there?
13 581   Cask. A Romane
13 582 
13 583    Cassi. Caska, by your Voyce
13 584 
13 585    Cask. Your Eare is good.
13 586 Cassius, what Night is this?
13 587   Cassi. A very pleasing Night to honest men
13 588 
13 589    Cask. Who euer knew the Heauens menace so?
13 590   Cassi. Those that haue knowne the Earth so full of
13 591 faults.
13 592 For my part, I haue walk'd about the streets,
13 593 Submitting me vnto the perillous Night;
13 594 And thus vnbraced, Caska, as you see,
13 595 Haue bar'd my Bosome to the Thunder-stone:
13 596 And when the crosse blew Lightning seem'd to open
13 597 The Brest of Heauen, I did present my selfe
13 598 Euen in the ayme, and very flash of it
13 599 
13 600    Cask. But wherefore did you so much tempt the Heauens?
13 601 It is the part of men, to feare and tremble,
13 602 When the most mightie Gods, by tokens send
13 603 Such dreadfull Heraulds, to astonish vs
13 604 
13 605    Cassi. You are dull, Caska:
13 606 And those sparkes of Life, that should be in a Roman,
13 607 You doe want, or else you vse not.
13 608 You looke pale, and gaze, and put on feare,
13 609 And cast your selfe in wonder,
13 610 To see the strange impatience of the Heauens:
13 611 But if you would consider the true cause,
13 612 Why all these Fires, why all these gliding Ghosts,
13 613 Why Birds and Beasts, from qualitie and kinde,
13 614 Why Old men, Fooles, and Children calculate,
13 615 Why all these things change from their Ordinance,
13 616 Their Natures, and pre-formed Faculties,
13 617 To monstrous qualitie; why you shall finde,
13 618 That Heauen hath infus'd them with these Spirits,
13 619 To make them Instruments of feare, and warning,
13 620 Vnto some monstrous State.
13 621 Now could I (Caska) name to thee a man,
13 622 Most like this dreadfull Night,
13 623 That Thunders, Lightens, opens Graues, and roares,
13 624 As doth the Lyon in the Capitoll:
13 625 A man no mightier then thy selfe, or me,
13 626 In personall action; yet prodigious growne,
13 627 And fearefull, as these strange eruptions are
13 628 
13 629    Cask. 'Tis Caesar that you meane:
13 630 Is it not, Cassius?
13 631   Cassi. Let it be who it is: for Romans now
13 632 Haue Thewes, and Limbes, like to their Ancestors;
13 633 But woe the while, our Fathers mindes are dead,
13 634 And we are gouern'd with our Mothers spirits,
13 635 Our yoake, and sufferance, shew vs Womanish
13 636 
13 637    Cask. Indeed, they say, the Senators to morrow
13 638 Meane to establish Caesar as a King:
13 639 And he shall weare his Crowne by Sea, and Land,
13 640 In euery place, saue here in Italy
13 641 
13 642    Cassi. I know where I will weare this Dagger then;
13 643 Cassius from Bondage will deliuer Cassius:
13 644 Therein, yee Gods, you make the weake most strong;
13 645 Therein, yee Gods, you Tyrants doe defeat.
13 646 Nor Stonie Tower, nor Walls of beaten Brasse,
13 647 Nor ayre-lesse Dungeon, nor strong Linkes of Iron,
13 648 Can be retentiue to the strength of spirit:
13 649 But Life being wearie of these worldly Barres,
13 650 Neuer lacks power to dismisse it selfe.
13 651 If I know this, know all the World besides,
13 652 That part of Tyrannie that I doe beare,
13 653 I can shake off at pleasure.
13 654 
13 655 Thunder still.
13 656 
13 657   Cask. So can I:
13 658 So euery Bond-man in his owne hand beares
13 659 The power to cancell his Captiuitie
13 660 
13 661    Cassi. And why should CÃ¦sar be a Tyrant then?
13 662 Poore man, I know he would not be a Wolfe,
13 663 But that he sees the Romans are but Sheepe:
13 664 He were no Lyon, were not Romans Hindes.
13 665 Those that with haste will make a mightie fire,
13 666 Begin it with weake Strawes. What trash is Rome?
13 667 What Rubbish, and what Offall? when it serues
13 668 For the base matter, to illuminate
13 669 So vile a thing as Caesar. But oh Griefe,
13 670 Where hast thou led me? I (perhaps) speake this
13 671 Before a willing Bond-man: then I know
13 672 My answere must be made. But I am arm'd,
13 673 And dangers are to me indifferent
13 674 
13 675    Cask. You speake to Caska, and to such a man,
13 676 That is no flearing Tell-tale. Hold, my Hand:
13 677 Be factious for redresse of all these Griefes,
13 678 And I will set this foot of mine as farre,
13 679 As who goes farthest
13 680 
13 681    Cassi. There's a Bargaine made.
13 682 Now know you, Caska, I haue mou'd already
13 683 Some certaine of the Noblest minded Romans
13 684 To vnder-goe, with me, an Enterprize,
13 685 Of Honorable dangerous consequence;
13 686 And I doe know by this, they stay for me
13 687 In Pompeyes Porch: for now this fearefull Night,
13 688 There is no stirre, or walking in the streetes;
13 689 And the Complexion of the Element
13 690 Is Fauors, like the Worke we haue in hand,
13 691 Most bloodie, fierie, and most terrible.
13 692 Enter Cinna.
13 693 
13 694   Caska. Stand close a while, for heere comes one in
13 695 haste
13 696 
13 697    Cassi. 'Tis Cinna, I doe know him by his Gate,
13 698 He is a friend. Cinna, where haste you so?
13 699   Cinna. To finde out you: Who's that, Metellus
13 700 Cymber?
13 701   Cassi. No, it is Caska, one incorporate
13 702 To our Attempts. Am I not stay'd for, Cinna?
13 703   Cinna. I am glad on't.
13 704 What a fearefull Night is this?
13 705 There's two or three of vs haue seene strange sights
13 706 
13 707    Cassi. Am I not stay'd for? tell me
13 708 
13 709    Cinna. Yes, you are. O Cassius,
13 710 If you could but winne the Noble Brutus
13 711 To our party-
13 712   Cassi. Be you content. Good Cinna, take this Paper,
13 713 And looke you lay it in the Pretors Chayre,
13 714 Where Brutus may but finde it: and throw this
13 715 In at his Window; set this vp with Waxe
13 716 Vpon old Brutus Statue: all this done,
13 717 Repaire to Pompeyes Porch, where you shall finde vs.
13 718 Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?
13 719   Cinna. All, but Metellus Cymber, and hee's gone
13 720 To seeke you at your house. Well, I will hie,
13 721 And so bestow these Papers as you bad me
13 722 
13 723    Cassi. That done, repayre to Pompeyes Theater.
13 724 
13 725 Exit Cinna.
13 726 
13 727 Come Caska, you and I will yet, ere day,
13 728 See Brutus at his house: three parts of him
13 729 Is ours alreadie, and the man entire
13 730 Vpon the next encounter, yeelds him ours
13 731 
13 732    Cask. O, he sits high in all the Peoples hearts:
13 733 And that which would appeare Offence in vs,
13 734 His Countenance, like richest Alchymie,
13 735 Will change to Vertue, and to Worthinesse
13 736 
13 737    Cassi. Him, and his worth, and our great need of him,
13 738 You haue right well conceited: let vs goe,
13 739 For it is after Mid-night, and ere day,
13 740 We will awake him, and be sure of him.
13 741 
13 742 Exeunt.
13 743 
13 744 
13 745 Actus Secundus.
13 746 
13 747 Enter Brutus in his Orchard.
13 748 
13 749   Brut. What Lucius, hoe?
13 750 I cannot, by the progresse of the Starres,
13 751 Giue guesse how neere to day- Lucius, I say?
13 752 I would it were my fault to sleepe so soundly.
13 753 When Lucius, when? awake, I say: what Lucius?
13 754 Enter Lucius.
13 755 
13 756   Luc. Call'd you, my Lord?
13 757   Brut. Get me a Tapor in my Study, Lucius:
13 758 When it is lighted, come and call me here
13 759 
13 760    Luc. I will, my Lord.
13 761 Enter.
13 762 
13 763   Brut. It must be by his death: and for my part,
13 764 I know no personall cause, to spurne at him,
13 765 But for the generall. He would be crown'd:
13 766 How that might change his nature, there's the question?
13 767 It is the bright day, that brings forth the Adder,
13 768 And that craues warie walking: Crowne him that,
13 769 And then I graunt we put a Sting in him,
13 770 That at his will he may doe danger with.
13 771 Th' abuse of Greatnesse, is, when it dis-ioynes
13 772 Remorse from Power: And to speake truth of Caesar,
13 773 I haue not knowne, when his Affections sway'd
13 774 More then his Reason. But 'tis a common proofe,
13 775 That Lowlynesse is young Ambitions Ladder,
13 776 Whereto the Climber vpward turnes his Face:
13 777 But when he once attaines the vpmost Round,
13 778 He then vnto the Ladder turnes his Backe,
13 779 Lookes in the Clouds, scorning the base degrees
13 780 By which he did ascend: so Caesar may;
13 781 Then least he may, preuent. And since the Quarrell
13 782 Will beare no colour, for the thing he is,
13 783 Fashion it thus; that what he is, augmented,
13 784 Would runne to these, and these extremities:
13 785 And therefore thinke him as a Serpents egge,
13 786 Which hatch'd, would as his kinde grow mischieuous;
13 787 And kill him in the shell.
13 788 Enter Lucius.
13 789 
13 790   Luc. The Taper burneth in your Closet, Sir:
13 791 Searching the Window for a Flint, I found
13 792 This Paper, thus seal'd vp, and I am sure
13 793 It did not lye there when I went to Bed.
13 794 
13 795 Giues him the Letter.
13 796 
13 797   Brut. Get you to Bed againe, it is not day:
13 798 Is not to morrow (Boy) the first of March?
13 799   Luc. I know not, Sir
13 800 
13 801    Brut. Looke in the Calender, and bring me word
13 802 
13 803    Luc. I will, Sir.
13 804 Enter.
13 805 
13 806   Brut. The exhalations, whizzing in the ayre,
13 807 Giue so much light, that I may reade by them.
13 808 
13 809 Opens the Letter, and reades.
13 810 
13 811 Brutus thou sleep'st; awake, and see thy selfe:
13 812 Shall Rome, &c. speake, strike, redresse.
13 813 Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake.
13 814 Such instigations haue beene often dropt,
13 815 Where I haue tooke them vp:
13 816 Shall Rome, &c. Thus must I piece it out:
13 817 Shall Rome stand vnder one mans awe? What Rome?
13 818 My Ancestors did from the streetes of Rome
13 819 The Tarquin driue, when he was call'd a King.
13 820 Speake, strike, redresse. Am I entreated
13 821 To speake, and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise,
13 822 If the redresse will follow, thou receiuest
13 823 Thy full Petition at the hand of Brutus.
13 824 Enter Lucius.
13 825 
13 826   Luc. Sir, March is wasted fifteene dayes.
13 827 
13 828 Knocke within.
13 829 
13 830   Brut. 'Tis good. Go to the Gate, some body knocks:
13 831 Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar,
13 832 I haue not slept.
13 833 Betweene the acting of a dreadfull thing,
13 834 And the first motion, all the Interim is
13 835 Like a Phantasma, or a hideous Dreame:
13 836 The Genius, and the mortall Instruments
13 837 Are then in councell; and the state of a man,
13 838 Like to a little Kingdome, suffers then
13 839 The nature of an Insurrection.
13 840 Enter Lucius.
13 841 
13 842   Luc. Sir, 'tis your Brother Cassius at the Doore,
13 843 Who doth desire to see you
13 844 
13 845    Brut. Is he alone?
13 846   Luc. No, Sir, there are moe with him
13 847 
13 848    Brut. Doe you know them?
13 849   Luc. No, Sir, their Hats are pluckt about their Eares,
13 850 And halfe their Faces buried in their Cloakes,
13 851 That by no meanes I may discouer them,
13 852 By any marke of fauour
13 853 
13 854    Brut. Let 'em enter:
13 855 They are the Faction. O Conspiracie,
13 856 Sham'st thou to shew thy dang'rous Brow by Night,
13 857 When euills are most free? O then, by day
13 858 Where wilt thou finde a Cauerne darke enough,
13 859 To maske thy monstrous Visage? Seek none Conspiracie,
13 860 Hide it in Smiles, and Affabilitie:
13 861 For if thou path thy natiue semblance on,
13 862 Not Erebus it selfe were dimme enough,
13 863 To hide thee from preuention.
13 864 Enter the Conspirators, Cassius, Caska, Decius, Cinna, Metellus,
13 865 and
13 866 Trebonius.
13 867 
13 868   Cass. I thinke we are too bold vpon your Rest:
13 869 Good morrow Brutus, doe we trouble you?
13 870   Brut. I haue beene vp this howre, awake all Night:
13 871 Know I these men, that come along with you?
13 872   Cass. Yes, euery man of them; and no man here
13 873 But honors you: and euery one doth wish,
13 874 You had but that opinion of your selfe,
13 875 Which euery Noble Roman beares of you.
13 876 This is Trebonius
13 877 
13 878    Brut. He is welcome hither
13 879 
13 880    Cass. This, Decius Brutus
13 881 
13 882    Brut. He is welcome too
13 883 
13 884    Cass. This, Caska; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus
13 885 Cymber
13 886 
13 887    Brut. They are all welcome.
13 888 What watchfull Cares doe interpose themselues
13 889 Betwixt your Eyes, and Night?
13 890   Cass. Shall I entreat a word?
13 891 
13 892 They whisper.
13 893 
13 894   Decius. Here lyes the East: doth not the Day breake
13 895 heere?
13 896   Cask. No
13 897 
13 898    Cin. O pardon, Sir, it doth; and yon grey Lines,
13 899 That fret the Clouds, are Messengers of Day
13 900 
13 901    Cask. You shall confesse, that you are both deceiu'd:
13 902 Heere, as I point my Sword, the Sunne arises,
13 903 Which is a great way growing on the South,
13 904 Weighing the youthfull Season of the yeare.
13 905 Some two moneths hence, vp higher toward the North
13 906 He first presents his fire, and the high East
13 907 Stands as the Capitoll, directly heere
13 908 
13 909    Bru. Giue me your hands all ouer, one by one
13 910 
13 911    Cas. And let vs sweare our Resolution
13 912 
13 913    Brut. No, not an Oath: if not the Face of men,
13 914 The sufferance of our Soules, the times Abuse;
13 915 If these be Motiues weake, breake off betimes,
13 916 And euery man hence, to his idle bed:
13 917 So let high-sighted-Tyranny range on,
13 918 Till each man drop by Lottery. But if these
13 919 (As I am sure they do) beare fire enough
13 920 To kindle Cowards, and to steele with valour
13 921 The melting Spirits of women. Then Countrymen,
13 922 What neede we any spurre, but our owne cause
13 923 To pricke vs to redresse? What other Bond,
13 924 Then secret Romans, that haue spoke the word,
13 925 And will not palter? And what other Oath,
13 926 Then Honesty to Honesty ingag'd,
13 927 That this shall be, or we will fall for it.
13 928 Sweare Priests and Cowards, and men Cautelous
13 929 Old feeble Carrions, and such suffering Soules
13 930 That welcome wrongs: Vnto bad causes, sweare
13 931 Such Creatures as men doubt; but do not staine
13 932 The euen vertue of our Enterprize,
13 933 Nor th' insuppressiue Mettle of our Spirits,
13 934 To thinke, that or our Cause, or our Performance
13 935 Did neede an Oath. When euery drop of blood
13 936 That euery Roman beares, and Nobly beares
13 937 Is guilty of a seuerall Bastardie,
13 938 If he do breake the smallest Particle
13 939 Of any promise that hath past from him
13 940 
13 941    Cas. But what of Cicero? Shall we sound him?
13 942 I thinke he will stand very strong with vs
13 943 
13 944    Cask. Let vs not leaue him out
13 945 
13 946    Cyn. No, by no meanes
13 947 
13 948    Metel. O let vs haue him, for his Siluer haires
13 949 Will purchase vs a good opinion:
13 950 And buy mens voyces, to commend our deeds:
13 951 It shall be sayd, his iudgement rul'd our hands,
13 952 Our youths, and wildenesse, shall no whit appeare,
13 953 But all be buried in his Grauity
13 954 
13 955    Bru. O name him not; let vs not breake with him,
13 956 For he will neuer follow any thing
13 957 That other men begin
13 958 
13 959    Cas. Then leaue him out
13 960 
13 961    Cask. Indeed, he is not fit
13 962 
13 963    Decius. Shall no man else be toucht, but onely Caesar?
13 964   Cas. Decius well vrg'd: I thinke it is not meet,
13 965 Marke Antony, so well belou'd of Caesar,
13 966 Should out-liue Caesar, we shall finde of him
13 967 A shrew'd Contriuer. And you know, his meanes
13 968 If he improue them, may well stretch so farre
13 969 As to annoy vs all: which to preuent,
13 970 Let Antony and Caesar fall together
13 971 
13 972    Bru. Our course will seeme too bloody, Caius Cassius,
13 973 To cut the Head off, and then hacke the Limbes:
13 974 Like Wrath in death, and Enuy afterwards:
13 975 For Antony, is but a Limbe of Caesar.
13 976 Let's be Sacrificers, but not Butchers Caius:
13 977 We all stand vp against the spirit of Caesar,
13 978 And in the Spirit of men, there is no blood:
13 979 O that we then could come by Caesars Spirit,
13 980 And not dismember Caesar! But (alas)
13 981 Caesar must bleed for it. And gentle Friends,
13 982 Let's kill him Boldly, but not Wrathfully:
13 983 Let's carue him, as a Dish fit for the Gods,
13 984 Not hew him as a Carkasse fit for Hounds:
13 985 And let our Hearts, as subtle Masters do,
13 986 Stirre vp their Seruants to an acte of Rage,
13 987 And after seeme to chide 'em. This shall make
13 988 Our purpose Necessary, and not Enuious.
13 989 Which so appearing to the common eyes,
13 990 We shall be call'd Purgers, not Murderers.
13 991 And for Marke Antony, thinke not of him:
13 992 For he can do no more then Caesars Arme,
13 993 When Caesars head is off
13 994 
13 995    Cas. Yet I feare him,
13 996 For in the ingrafted loue he beares to Caesar
13 997 
13 998    Bru. Alas, good Cassius, do not thinke of him:
13 999 If he loue Caesar, all that he can do
13 1000 Is to himselfe; take thought, and dye for Caesar,
13 1001 And that were much he should: for he is giuen
13 1002 To sports, to wildenesse, and much company
13 1003 
13 1004    Treb. There is no feare in him; let him not dye,
13 1005 For he will liue, and laugh at this heereafter.
13 1006 
13 1007 Clocke strikes.
13 1008 
13 1009   Bru. Peace, count the Clocke
13 1010 
13 1011    Cas. The Clocke hath stricken three
13 1012 
13 1013    Treb. 'Tis time to part
13 1014 
13 1015    Cass. But it is doubtfull yet,
13 1016 Whether Caesar will come forth to day, or no:
13 1017 For he is Superstitious growne of late,
13 1018 Quite from the maine Opinion he held once,
13 1019 Of Fantasie, of Dreames, and Ceremonies:
13 1020 It may be, these apparant Prodigies,
13 1021 The vnaccustom'd Terror of this night,
13 1022 And the perswasion of his Augurers,
13 1023 May hold him from the Capitoll to day
13 1024 
13 1025    Decius. Neuer feare that: If he be so resolu'd,
13 1026 I can ore-sway him: For he loues to heare,
13 1027 That Vnicornes may be betray'd with Trees,
13 1028 And Beares with Glasses, Elephants with Holes,
13 1029 Lyons with Toyles, and men with Flatterers.
13 1030 But, when I tell him, he hates Flatterers,
13 1031 He sayes, he does; being then most flattered.
13 1032 Let me worke:
13 1033 For I can giue his humour the true bent;
13 1034 And I will bring him to the Capitoll
13 1035 
13 1036    Cas. Nay, we will all of vs, be there to fetch him
13 1037 
13 1038    Bru. By the eight houre, is that the vttermost?
13 1039   Cin. Be that the vttermost, and faile not then
13 1040 
13 1041    Met. Caius Ligarius doth beare Caesar hard,
13 1042 Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey;
13 1043 I wonder none of you haue thought of him
13 1044 
13 1045    Bru. Now good Metellus go along by him:
13 1046 He loues me well, and I haue giuen him Reasons,
13 1047 Send him but hither, and Ile fashion him
13 1048 
13 1049    Cas. The morning comes vpon's:
13 1050 Wee'l leaue you Brutus,
13 1051 And Friends disperse your selues; but all remember
13 1052 What you haue said, and shew your selues true Romans
13 1053 
13 1054    Bru. Good Gentlemen, looke fresh and merrily,
13 1055 Let not our lookes put on our purposes,
13 1056 But beare it as our Roman Actors do,
13 1057 With vntyr'd Spirits, and formall Constancie,
13 1058 And so good morrow to you euery one.
13 1059 
13 1060 Exeunt.
13 1061 
13 1062 Manet Brutus.
13 1063 
13 1064 Boy: Lucius: Fast asleepe? It is no matter,
13 1065 Enioy the hony-heauy-Dew of Slumber:
13 1066 Thou hast no Figures, nor no Fantasies,
13 1067 Which busie care drawes, in the braines of men;
13 1068 Therefore thou sleep'st so sound.
13 1069 Enter Portia.
13 1070 
13 1071   Por. Brutus, my Lord
13 1072 
13 1073    Bru. Portia: What meane you? wherfore rise you now?
13 1074 It is not for your health, thus to commit
13 1075 Your weake condition, to the raw cold morning
13 1076 
13 1077    Por. Nor for yours neither. Y'haue vngently Brutus
13 1078 Stole from my bed: and yesternight at Supper
13 1079 You sodainly arose, and walk'd about,
13 1080 Musing, and sighing, with your armes acrosse
13 1081 And when I ask'd you what the matter was,
13 1082 You star'd vpon me, with vngentle lookes.
13 1083 I vrg'd you further, then you scratch'd your head,
13 1084 And too impatiently stampt with your foote:
13 1085 Yet I insisted, yet you answer'd not,
13 1086 But with an angry wafter of your hand
13 1087 Gaue signe for me to leaue you: So I did,
13 1088 Fearing to strengthen that impatience
13 1089 Which seem'd too much inkindled; and withall,
13 1090 Hoping it was but an effect of Humor,
13 1091 Which sometime hath his houre with euery man.
13 1092 It will not let you eate, nor talke, nor sleepe;
13 1093 And could it worke so much vpon your shape,
13 1094 As it hath much preuayl'd on your Condition,
13 1095 I should not know you Brutus. Deare my Lord,
13 1096 Make me acquainted with your cause of greefe
13 1097 
13 1098    Bru. I am not well in health, and that is all
13 1099 
13 1100    Por. Brutus is wise, and were he not in health,
13 1101 He would embrace the meanes to come by it
13 1102 
13 1103    Bru. Why so I do: good Portia go to bed
13 1104 
13 1105    Por. Is Brutus sicke? And is it Physicall
13 1106 To walke vnbraced, and sucke vp the humours
13 1107 Of the danke Morning? What, is Brutus sicke?
13 1108 And will he steale out of his wholsome bed
13 1109 To dare the vile contagion of the Night?
13 1110 And tempt the Rhewmy, and vnpurged Ayre,
13 1111 To adde vnto his sicknesse? No my Brutus,
13 1112 You haue some sicke Offence within your minde,
13 1113 Which by the Right and Vertue of my place
13 1114 I ought to know of: And vpon my knees,
13 1115 I charme you, by my once commended Beauty,
13 1116 By all your vowes of Loue, and that great Vow
13 1117 Which did incorporate and make vs one,
13 1118 That you vnfold to me, your selfe; your halfe
13 1119 Why you are heauy: and what men to night
13 1120 Haue had resort to you: for heere haue beene
13 1121 Some sixe or seuen, who did hide their faces
13 1122 Euen from darknesse
13 1123 
13 1124    Bru. Kneele not gentle Portia
13 1125 
13 1126    Por. I should not neede, if you were gentle Brutus.
13 1127 Within the Bond of Marriage, tell me Brutus,
13 1128 Is it excepted, I should know no Secrets
13 1129 That appertaine to you? Am I your Selfe,
13 1130 But as it were in sort, or limitation?
13 1131 To keepe with you at Meales, comfort your Bed,
13 1132 And talke to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the Suburbs
13 1133 Of your good pleasure? If it be no more,
13 1134 Portia is Brutus Harlot, not his Wife
13 1135 
13 1136    Bru. You are my true and honourable Wife,
13 1137 As deere to me, as are the ruddy droppes
13 1138 That visit my sad heart
13 1139 
13 1140    Por. If this were true, then should I know this secret.
13 1141 I graunt I am a Woman; but withall,
13 1142 A Woman that Lord Brutus tooke to Wife:
13 1143 I graunt I am a Woman; but withall,
13 1144 A Woman well reputed: Cato's Daughter.
13 1145 Thinke you, I am no stronger then my Sex
13 1146 Being so Father'd, and so Husbanded?
13 1147 Tell me your Counsels, I will not disclose 'em:
13 1148 I haue made strong proofe of my Constancie,
13 1149 Giuing my selfe a voluntary wound
13 1150 Heere, in the Thigh: Can I beare that with patience,
13 1151 And not my Husbands Secrets?
13 1152   Bru. O ye Gods!
13 1153 Render me worthy of this Noble Wife.
13 1154 
13 1155 Knocke.
13 1156 
13 1157 Harke, harke, one knockes: Portia go in a while,
13 1158 And by and by thy bosome shall partake
13 1159 The secrets of my Heart.
13 1160 All my engagements, I will construe to thee,
13 1161 All the Charractery of my sad browes:
13 1162 Leaue me with hast.
13 1163 
13 1164 Exit Portia.
13 1165 
13 1166 Enter Lucius and Ligarius.
13 1167 
13 1168 Lucius, who's that knockes
13 1169 
13 1170    Luc. Heere is a sicke man that would speak with you
13 1171 
13 1172    Bru. Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of.
13 1173 Boy, stand aside. Caius Ligarius, how?
13 1174   Cai. Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue
13 1175 
13 1176    Bru. O what a time haue you chose out braue Caius
13 1177 To weare a Kerchiefe? Would you were not sicke
13 1178 
13 1179    Cai. I am not sicke, if Brutus haue in hand
13 1180 Any exploit worthy the name of Honor
13 1181 
13 1182    Bru. Such an exploit haue I in hand Ligarius,
13 1183 Had you a healthfull eare to heare of it
13 1184 
13 1185    Cai. By all the Gods that Romans bow before,
13 1186 I heere discard my sicknesse. Soule of Rome,
13 1187 Braue Sonne, deriu'd from Honourable Loines,
13 1188 Thou like an Exorcist, hast coniur'd vp
13 1189 My mortified Spirit. Now bid me runne,
13 1190 And I will striue with things impossible,
13 1191 Yea get the better of them. What's to do?
13 1192   Bru. A peece of worke,
13 1193 That will make sicke men whole
13 1194 
13 1195    Cai. But are not some whole, that we must make sicke?
13 1196   Bru. That must we also. What it is my Caius,
13 1197 I shall vnfold to thee, as we are going,
13 1198 To whom it must be done
13 1199 
13 1200    Cai. Set on your foote,
13 1201 And with a heart new-fir'd, I follow you,
13 1202 To do I know not what: but it sufficeth
13 1203 That Brutus leads me on.
13 1204 
13 1205 Thunder
13 1206 
13 1207   Bru. Follow me then.
13 1208 
13 1209 Exeunt.
13 1210 
13 1211 Thunder & Lightning
13 1212 
13 1213 Enter Iulius Caesar in his Night-gowne.
13 1214 
13 1215   Caesar. Nor Heauen, nor Earth,
13 1216 Haue beene at peace to night:
13 1217 Thrice hath Calphurnia, in her sleepe cryed out,
13 1218 Helpe, ho: They murther Caesar. Who's within?
13 1219 Enter a Seruant.
13 1220 
13 1221   Ser. My Lord
13 1222 
13 1223    Caes Go bid the Priests do present Sacrifice,
13 1224 And bring me their opinions of Successe
13 1225 
13 1226    Ser. I will my Lord.
13 1227 
13 1228 Exit
13 1229 
13 1230 Enter Calphurnia.
13 1231 
13 1232   Cal. What mean you Caesar? Think you to walk forth?
13 1233 You shall not stirre out of your house to day
13 1234 
13 1235    Caes Caesar shall forth; the things that threaten'd me,
13 1236 Ne're look'd but on my backe: When they shall see
13 1237 The face of Caesar, they are vanished
13 1238 
13 1239    Calp. Caesar, I neuer stood on Ceremonies,
13 1240 Yet now they fright me: There is one within,
13 1241 Besides the things that we haue heard and seene,
13 1242 Recounts most horrid sights seene by the Watch.
13 1243 A Lionnesse hath whelped in the streets,
13 1244 And Graues haue yawn'd, and yeelded vp their dead;
13 1245 Fierce fiery Warriours fight vpon the Clouds
13 1246 In Rankes and Squadrons, and right forme of Warre
13 1247 Which drizel'd blood vpon the Capitoll:
13 1248 The noise of Battell hurtled in the Ayre:
13 1249 Horsses do neigh, and dying men did grone,
13 1250 And Ghosts did shrieke and squeale about the streets.
13 1251 O Caesar, these things are beyond all vse,
13 1252 And I do feare them
13 1253 
13 1254    Caes What can be auoyded
13 1255 Whose end is purpos'd by the mighty Gods?
13 1256 Yet Caesar shall go forth: for these Predictions
13 1257 Are to the world in generall, as to Caesar
13 1258 
13 1259    Calp. When Beggers dye, there are no Comets seen,
13 1260 The Heauens themselues blaze forth the death of Princes
13 1261   Caes Cowards dye many times before their deaths,
13 1262 The valiant neuer taste of death but once:
13 1263 Of all the Wonders that I yet haue heard,
13 1264 It seemes to me most strange that men should feare,
13 1265 Seeing that death, a necessary end
13 1266 Will come, when it will come.
13 1267 Enter a Seruant.
13 1268 
13 1269 What say the Augurers?
13 1270   Ser. They would not haue you to stirre forth to day.
13 1271 Plucking the intrailes of an Offering forth,
13 1272 They could not finde a heart within the beast
13 1273 
13 1274    Caes The Gods do this in shame of Cowardice:
13 1275 Caesar should be a Beast without a heart
13 1276 If he should stay at home to day for feare:
13 1277 No Caesar shall not; Danger knowes full well
13 1278 That Caesar is more dangerous then he.
13 1279 We heare two Lyons litter'd in one day,
13 1280 And I the elder and more terrible,
13 1281 And Caesar shall go foorth
13 1282 
13 1283    Calp. Alas my Lord,
13 1284 Your wisedome is consum'd in confidence:
13 1285 Do not go forth to day: Call it my feare,
13 1286 That keepes you in the house, and not your owne.
13 1287 Wee'l send Mark Antony to the Senate house,
13 1288 And he shall say, you are not well to day:
13 1289 Let me vpon my knee, preuaile in this
13 1290 
13 1291    Caes Mark Antony shall say I am not well,
13 1292 And for thy humor, I will stay at home.
13 1293 Enter Decius.
13 1294 
13 1295 Heere's Decius Brutus, he shall tell them so
13 1296 
13 1297    Deci. Caesar, all haile: Good morrow worthy Caesar,
13 1298 I come to fetch you to the Senate house
13 1299 
13 1300    Caes And you are come in very happy time,
13 1301 To beare my greeting to the Senators,
13 1302 And tell them that I will not come to day:
13 1303 Cannot, is false: and that I dare not, falser:
13 1304 I will not come to day, tell them so Decius
13 1305 
13 1306    Calp. Say he is sicke
13 1307 
13 1308    Caes Shall Caesar send a Lye?
13 1309 Haue I in Conquest stretcht mine Arme so farre,
13 1310 To be afear'd to tell Gray-beards the truth:
13 1311 Decius, go tell them, Caesar will not come
13 1312 
13 1313    Deci. Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause,
13 1314 Lest I be laught at when I tell them so
13 1315 
13 1316    Caes The cause is in my Will, I will not come,
13 1317 That is enough to satisfie the Senate.
13 1318 But for your priuate satisfaction,
13 1319 Because I loue you, I will let you know.
13 1320 Calphurnia heere my wife, stayes me at home:
13 1321 She dreampt to night, she saw my Statue,
13 1322 Which like a Fountaine, with an hundred spouts
13 1323 Did run pure blood: and many lusty Romans
13 1324 Came smiling, & did bathe their hands in it:
13 1325 And these does she apply, for warnings and portents,
13 1326 And euils imminent; and on her knee
13 1327 Hath begg'd, that I will stay at home to day
13 1328 
13 1329    Deci. This Dreame is all amisse interpreted,
13 1330 It was a vision, faire and fortunate:
13 1331 Your Statue spouting blood in many pipes,
13 1332 In which so many smiling Romans bath'd,
13 1333 Signifies, that from you great Rome shall sucke
13 1334 Reuiuing blood, and that great men shall presse
13 1335 For Tinctures, Staines, Reliques, and Cognisance.
13 1336 This by Calphurnia's Dreame is signified
13 1337 
13 1338    Caes And this way haue you well expounded it
13 1339 
13 1340    Deci. I haue, when you haue heard what I can say:
13 1341 And know it now, the Senate haue concluded
13 1342 To giue this day, a Crowne to mighty Caesar.
13 1343 If you shall send them word you will not come,
13 1344 Their mindes may change. Besides, it were a mocke
13 1345 Apt to be render'd, for some one to say,
13 1346 Breake vp the Senate, till another time:
13 1347 When Caesars wife shall meete with better Dreames.
13 1348 If Caesar hide himselfe, shall they not whisper
13 1349 Loe Caesar is affraid?
13 1350 Pardon me Caesar, for my deere deere loue
13 1351 To your proceeding, bids me tell you this:
13 1352 And reason to my loue is liable
13 1353 
13 1354    Caes How foolish do your fears seeme now Calphurnia?
13 1355 I am ashamed I did yeeld to them.
13 1356 Giue me my Robe, for I will go.
13 1357 Enter Brutus, Ligarius, Metellus, Caska, Trebonius, Cynna, and
13 1358 Publius.
13 1359 
13 1360 And looke where Publius is come to fetch me
13 1361 
13 1362    Pub. Good morrow Caesar
13 1363 
13 1364    Caes Welcome Publius.
13 1365 What Brutus, are you stirr'd so earely too?
13 1366 Good morrow Caska: Caius Ligarius,
13 1367 Caesar was ne're so much your enemy,
13 1368 As that same Ague which hath made you leane.
13 1369 What is't a Clocke?
13 1370   Bru. Caesar, 'tis strucken eight
13 1371 
13 1372    Caes I thanke you for your paines and curtesie.
13 1373 Enter Antony.
13 1374 
13 1375 See, Antony that Reuels long a-nights
13 1376 Is notwithstanding vp. Good morrow Antony
13 1377 
13 1378    Ant. So to most Noble Caesar
13 1379 
13 1380    Caes Bid them prepare within:
13 1381 I am too blame to be thus waited for.
13 1382 Now Cynna, now Metellus: what Trebonius,
13 1383 I haue an houres talke in store for you:
13 1384 Remember that you call on me to day:
13 1385 Be neere me, that I may remember you
13 1386 
13 1387    Treb. Caesar I will: and so neere will I be,
13 1388 That your best Friends shall wish I had beene further
13 1389 
13 1390    Caes Good Friends go in, and taste some wine with me.
13 1391 And we (like Friends) will straight way go together
13 1392 
13 1393    Bru. That euery like is not the same, O Caesar,
13 1394 The heart of Brutus earnes to thinke vpon.
13 1395 
13 1396 Exeunt.
13 1397 
13 1398 Enter Artemidorus.
13 1399 
13 1400 Caesar, beware of Brutus, take heede of Cassius; come not
13 1401 neere Caska, haue an eye to Cynna, trust not Trebonius, marke
13 1402 well Metellus Cymber, Decius Brutus loues thee not: Thou
13 1403 hast wrong'd Caius Ligarius. There is but one minde in all
13 1404 these men, and it is bent against Caesar: If thou beest not
13 1405 Immortall,
13 1406 looke about you: Security giues way to Conspiracie.
13 1407 The mighty Gods defend thee.
13 1408 Thy Louer, Artemidorus.
13 1409 Heere will I stand, till Caesar passe along,
13 1410 And as a Sutor will I giue him this:
13 1411 My heart laments, that Vertue cannot liue
13 1412 Out of the teeth of Emulation.
13 1413 If thou reade this, O Caesar, thou mayest liue;
13 1414 If not, the Fates with Traitors do contriue.
13 1415 Enter.
13 1416 
13 1417 Enter Portia and Lucius.
13 1418 
13 1419   Por. I prythee Boy, run to the Senate-house,
13 1420 Stay not to answer me, but get thee gone.
13 1421 Why doest thou stay?
13 1422   Luc. To know my errand Madam
13 1423 
13 1424    Por. I would haue had thee there and heere agen
13 1425 Ere I can tell thee what thou should'st do there:
13 1426 O Constancie, be strong vpon my side,
13 1427 Set a huge Mountaine 'tweene my Heart and Tongue:
13 1428 I haue a mans minde, but a womans might:
13 1429 How hard it is for women to keepe counsell.
13 1430 Art thou heere yet?
13 1431   Luc. Madam, what should I do?
13 1432 Run to the Capitoll, and nothing else?
13 1433 And so returne to you, and nothing else?
13 1434   Por. Yes, bring me word Boy, if thy Lord look well,
13 1435 For he went sickly forth: and take good note
13 1436 What Caesar doth, what Sutors presse to him.
13 1437 Hearke Boy, what noyse is that?
13 1438   Luc. I heare none Madam
13 1439 
13 1440    Por. Prythee listen well:
13 1441 I heard a bussling Rumor like a Fray,
13 1442 And the winde brings it from the Capitoll
13 1443 
13 1444    Luc. Sooth Madam, I heare nothing.
13 1445 Enter the Soothsayer.
13 1446 
13 1447   Por. Come hither Fellow, which way hast thou bin?
13 1448   Sooth. At mine owne house, good Lady
13 1449 
13 1450    Por. What is't a clocke?
13 1451   Sooth. About the ninth houre Lady
13 1452 
13 1453    Por. Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitoll?
13 1454   Sooth. Madam not yet, I go to take my stand,
13 1455 To see him passe on to the Capitoll
13 1456 
13 1457    Por. Thou hast some suite to Caesar, hast thou not?
13 1458   Sooth. That I haue Lady, if it will please Caesar
13 1459 To be so good to Caesar, as to heare me:
13 1460 I shall beseech him to befriend himselfe
13 1461 
13 1462    Por. Why know'st thou any harme's intended towards
13 1463 him?
13 1464   Sooth. None that I know will be,
13 1465 Much that I feare may chance:
13 1466 Good morrow to you: heere the street is narrow:
13 1467 The throng that followes Caesar at the heeles,
13 1468 Of Senators, of Praetors, common Sutors,
13 1469 Will crowd a feeble man (almost) to death:
13 1470 Ile get me to a place more voyd, and there
13 1471 Speake to great Caesar as he comes along.
13 1472 
13 1473 Exit
13 1474 
13 1475   Por. I must go in:
13 1476 Aye me! How weake a thing
13 1477 The heart of woman is? O Brutus,
13 1478 The Heauens speede thee in thine enterprize.
13 1479 Sure the Boy heard me: Brutus hath a suite
13 1480 That Caesar will not grant. O, I grow faint:
13 1481 Run Lucius, and commend me to my Lord,
13 1482 Say I am merry; Come to me againe,
13 1483 And bring me word what he doth say to thee.
13 1484 
13 1485 Exeunt.
13 1486 
13 1487 Actus Tertius.
13 1488 
13 1489 Flourish
13 1490 
13 1491 Enter Caesar, Brutus, Cassius, Caska, Decius, Metellus, Trebonius,
13 1492 Cynna,
13 1493 Antony, Lepidus, Artimedorus, Publius, and the Soothsayer.
13 1494 
13 1495   Caes The Ides of March are come
13 1496 
13 1497    Sooth. I Caesar, but not gone
13 1498 
13 1499    Art. Haile Caesar: Read this Scedule
13 1500 
13 1501    Deci. Trebonius doth desire you to ore-read
13 1502 (At your best leysure) this his humble suite
13 1503 
13 1504    Art. O Caesar, reade mine first: for mine's a suite
13 1505 That touches Caesar neerer. Read it great Caesar
13 1506 
13 1507    Caes What touches vs our selfe, shall be last seru'd
13 1508 
13 1509    Art. Delay not Caesar, read it instantly
13 1510 
13 1511    Caes What, is the fellow mad?
13 1512   Pub. Sirra, giue place
13 1513 
13 1514    Cassi. What, vrge you your Petitions in the street?
13 1515 Come to the Capitoll
13 1516 
13 1517    Popil. I wish your enterprize to day may thriue
13 1518 
13 1519    Cassi. What enterprize Popillius?
13 1520   Popil. Fare you well
13 1521 
13 1522    Bru. What said Popillius Lena?
13 1523   Cassi. He wisht to day our enterprize might thriue:
13 1524 I feare our purpose is discouered
13 1525 
13 1526    Bru. Looke how he makes to Caesar: marke him
13 1527 
13 1528    Cassi. Caska be sodaine, for we feare preuention.
13 1529 Brutus what shall be done? If this be knowne,
13 1530 Cassius or Caesar neuer shall turne backe,
13 1531 For I will slay my selfe
13 1532 
13 1533    Bru. Cassius be constant:
13 1534 Popillius Lena speakes not of our purposes,
13 1535 For looke he smiles, and Caesar doth not change
13 1536 
13 1537    Cassi. Trebonius knowes his time: for look you Brutus
13 1538 He drawes Mark Antony out of the way
13 1539 
13 1540    Deci. Where is Metellus Cimber, let him go,
13 1541 And presently preferre his suite to Caesar
13 1542 
13 1543    Bru. He is addrest: presse neere, and second him
13 1544 
13 1545    Cin. Caska, you are the first that reares your hand
13 1546 
13 1547    Caes Are we all ready? What is now amisse,
13 1548 That Caesar and his Senate must redresse?
13 1549   Metel. Most high, most mighty, and most puisant Caesar
13 1550 Metellus Cymber throwes before thy Seate
13 1551 An humble heart
13 1552 
13 1553    Caes I must preuent thee Cymber:
13 1554 These couchings, and these lowly courtesies
13 1555 Might fire the blood of ordinary men,
13 1556 And turne pre-Ordinance, and first Decree
13 1557 Into the lane of Children. Be not fond,
13 1558 To thinke that Caesar beares such Rebell blood
13 1559 That will be thaw'd from the true quality
13 1560 With that which melteth Fooles, I meane sweet words,
13 1561 Low-crooked-curtsies, and base Spaniell fawning:
13 1562 Thy Brother by decree is banished:
13 1563 If thou doest bend, and pray, and fawne for him,
13 1564 I spurne thee like a Curre out of my way:
13 1565 Know, Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause
13 1566 Will he be satisfied
13 1567 
13 1568    Metel. Is there no voyce more worthy then my owne,
13 1569 To sound more sweetly in great Caesars eare,
13 1570 For the repealing of my banish'd Brother?
13 1571   Bru. I kisse thy hand, but not in flattery Caesar:
13 1572 Desiring thee, that Publius Cymber may
13 1573 Haue an immediate freedome of repeale
13 1574 
13 1575    Caes What Brutus?
13 1576   Cassi. Pardon Caesar: Caesar pardon:
13 1577 As lowe as to thy foote doth Cassius fall,
13 1578 To begge infranchisement for Publius Cymber
13 1579 
13 1580    Caes I could be well mou'd, if I were as you,
13 1581 If I could pray to mooue, Prayers would mooue me:
13 1582 But I am constant as the Northerne Starre,
13 1583 Of whose true fixt, and resting quality,
13 1584 There is no fellow in the Firmament.
13 1585 The Skies are painted with vnnumbred sparkes,
13 1586 They are all Fire, and euery one doth shine:
13 1587 But, there's but one in all doth hold his place.
13 1588 So, in the World; 'Tis furnish'd well with Men,
13 1589 And Men are Flesh and Blood, and apprehensiue;
13 1590 Yet in the number, I do know but One
13 1591 That vnassayleable holds on his Ranke,
13 1592 Vnshak'd of Motion: and that I am he,
13 1593 Let me a little shew it, euen in this:
13 1594 That I was constant Cymber should be banish'd,
13 1595 And constant do remaine to keepe him so
13 1596 
13 1597    Cinna. O Caesar
13 1598 
13 1599    Caes Hence: Wilt thou lift vp Olympus?
13 1600   Decius. Great Caesar
13 1601 
13 1602    Caes Doth not Brutus bootlesse kneele?
13 1603   Cask. Speake hands for me.
13 1604 
13 1605 They stab Caesar.
13 1606 
13 1607   Caes Et Tu Brute? - Then fall Caesar.
13 1608 
13 1609 Dyes
13 1610 
13 1611   Cin. Liberty, Freedome; Tyranny is dead,
13 1612 Run hence, proclaime, cry it about the Streets
13 1613 
13 1614    Cassi. Some to the common Pulpits, and cry out
13 1615 Liberty, Freedome, and Enfranchisement
13 1616 
13 1617    Bru. People and Senators, be not affrighted:
13 1618 Fly not, stand still: Ambitions debt is paid
13 1619 
13 1620    Cask. Go to the Pulpit Brutus
13 1621 
13 1622    Dec. And Cassius too
13 1623 
13 1624    Bru. Where's Publius?
13 1625   Cin. Heere, quite confounded with this mutiny
13 1626 
13 1627    Met. Stand fast together, least some Friend of Caesars
13 1628 Should chance-
13 1629   Bru. Talke not of standing. Publius good cheere,
13 1630 There is no harme intended to your person,
13 1631 Nor to no Roman else: so tell them Publius
13 1632 
13 1633    Cassi. And leaue vs Publius, least that the people
13 1634 Rushing on vs, should do your Age some mischiefe
13 1635 
13 1636    Bru. Do so, and let no man abide this deede,
13 1637 But we the Doers.
13 1638 Enter Trebonius
13 1639 
13 1640    Cassi. Where is Antony?
13 1641   Treb. Fled to his House amaz'd:
13 1642 Men, Wiues, and Children, stare, cry out, and run,
13 1643 As it were Doomesday
13 1644 
13 1645    Bru. Fates, we will know your pleasures:
13 1646 That we shall dye we know, 'tis but the time
13 1647 And drawing dayes out, that men stand vpon
13 1648 
13 1649    Cask. Why he that cuts off twenty yeares of life,
13 1650 Cuts off so many yeares of fearing death
13 1651 
13 1652    Bru. Grant that, and then is Death a Benefit:
13 1653 So are we Caesars Friends, that haue abridg'd
13 1654 His time of fearing death. Stoope Romans, stoope,
13 1655 And let vs bathe our hands in Caesars blood
13 1656 Vp to the Elbowes, and besmeare our Swords:
13 1657 Then walke we forth, euen to the Market place,
13 1658 And wauing our red Weapons o're our heads,
13 1659 Let's all cry Peace, Freedome, and Liberty
13 1660 
13 1661    Cassi. Stoop then, and wash. How many Ages hence
13 1662 Shall this our lofty Scene be acted ouer,
13 1663 In State vnborne, and Accents yet vnknowne?
13 1664   Bru. How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,
13 1665 That now on Pompeyes Basis lye along,
13 1666 No worthier then the dust?
13 1667   Cassi. So oft as that shall be,
13 1668 So often shall the knot of vs be call'd,
13 1669 The Men that gaue their Country liberty
13 1670 
13 1671    Dec. What, shall we forth?
13 1672   Cassi. I, euery man away.
13 1673 Brutus shall leade, and we will grace his heeles
13 1674 With the most boldest, and best hearts of Rome.
13 1675 Enter a Seruant.
13 1676 
13 1677   Bru. Soft, who comes heere? A friend of Antonies
13 1678 
13 1679    Ser. Thus Brutus did my Master bid me kneele;
13 1680 Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall downe,
13 1681 And being prostrate, thus he bad me say:
13 1682 Brutus is Noble, Wise, Valiant, and Honest;
13 1683 Caesar was Mighty, Bold, Royall, and Louing:
13 1684 Say, I loue Brutus, and I honour him;
13 1685 Say, I fear'd Caesar, honour'd him, and lou'd him.
13 1686 If Brutus will vouchsafe, that Antony
13 1687 May safely come to him, and be resolu'd
13 1688 How Caesar hath deseru'd to lye in death,
13 1689 Mark Antony, shall not loue Caesar dead
13 1690 So well as Brutus liuing; but will follow
13 1691 The Fortunes and Affayres of Noble Brutus,
13 1692 Thorough the hazards of this vntrod State,
13 1693 With all true Faith. So sayes my Master Antony
13 1694 
13 1695    Bru. Thy Master is a Wise and Valiant Romane,
13 1696 I neuer thought him worse:
13 1697 Tell him, so please him come vnto this place
13 1698 He shall be satisfied: and by my Honor
13 1699 Depart vntouch'd
13 1700 
13 1701    Ser. Ile fetch him presently.
13 1702 
13 1703 Exit Seruant.
13 1704 
13 1705   Bru. I know that we shall haue him well to Friend
13 1706 
13 1707    Cassi. I wish we may: But yet haue I a minde
13 1708 That feares him much: and my misgiuing still
13 1709 Falles shrewdly to the purpose.
13 1710 Enter Antony.
13 1711 
13 1712   Bru. But heere comes Antony:
13 1713 Welcome Mark Antony
13 1714 
13 1715    Ant. O mighty Caesar! Dost thou lye so lowe?
13 1716 Are all thy Conquests, Glories, Triumphes, Spoiles,
13 1717 Shrunke to this little Measure? Fare thee well.
13 1718 I know not Gentlemen what you intend,
13 1719 Who else must be let blood, who else is ranke:
13 1720 If I my selfe, there is no houre so fit
13 1721 As Caesars deaths houre; nor no Instrument
13 1722 Of halfe that worth, as those your Swords; made rich
13 1723 With the most Noble blood of all this World.
13 1724 I do beseech yee, if you beare me hard,
13 1725 Now, whil'st your purpled hands do reeke and smoake,
13 1726 Fulfill your pleasure. Liue a thousand yeeres,
13 1727 I shall not finde my selfe so apt to dye.
13 1728 No place will please me so, no meane of death,
13 1729 As heere by Caesar, and by you cut off,
13 1730 The Choice and Master Spirits of this Age
13 1731 
13 1732    Bru. O Antony! Begge not your death of vs:
13 1733 Though now we must appeare bloody and cruell,
13 1734 As by our hands, and this our present Acte
13 1735 You see we do: Yet see you but our hands,
13 1736 And this, the bleeding businesse they haue done:
13 1737 Our hearts you see not, they are pittifull:
13 1738 And pitty to the generall wrong of Rome,
13 1739 As fire driues out fire, so pitty, pitty
13 1740 Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,
13 1741 To you, our Swords haue leaden points Marke Antony:
13 1742 Our Armes in strength of malice, and our Hearts
13 1743 Of Brothers temper, do receiue you in,
13 1744 With all kinde loue, good thoughts, and reuerence
13 1745 
13 1746    Cassi. Your voyce shall be as strong as any mans,
13 1747 In the disposing of new Dignities
13 1748 
13 1749    Bru. Onely be patient, till we haue appeas'd
13 1750 The Multitude, beside themselues with feare,
13 1751 And then, we will deliuer you the cause,
13 1752 Why I, that did loue Caesar when I strooke him,
13 1753 Haue thus proceeded
13 1754 
13 1755    Ant. I doubt not of your Wisedome:
13 1756 Let each man render me his bloody hand.
13 1757 First Marcus Brutus will I shake with you;
13 1758 Next Caius Cassius do I take your hand;
13 1759 Now Decius Brutus yours; now yours Metellus;
13 1760 Yours Cinna; and my valiant Caska, yours;
13 1761 Though last, not least in loue, yours good Trebonius.
13 1762 Gentlemen all: Alas, what shall I say,
13 1763 My credit now stands on such slippery ground,
13 1764 That one of two bad wayes you must conceit me,
13 1765 Either a Coward, or a Flatterer.
13 1766 That I did loue thee Caesar, O 'tis true:
13 1767 If then thy Spirit looke vpon vs now,
13 1768 Shall it not greeue thee deerer then thy death,
13 1769 To see thy Antony making his peace,
13 1770 Shaking the bloody fingers of thy Foes?
13 1771 Most Noble, in the presence of thy Coarse,
13 1772 Had I as many eyes, as thou hast wounds,
13 1773 Weeping as fast as they streame forth thy blood,
13 1774 It would become me better, then to close
13 1775 In tearmes of Friendship with thine enemies.
13 1776 Pardon me Iulius, heere was't thou bay'd braue Hart,
13 1777 Heere did'st thou fall, and heere thy Hunters stand
13 1778 Sign'd in thy Spoyle, and Crimson'd in thy Lethee.
13 1779 O World! thou wast the Forrest to this Hart,
13 1780 And this indeed, O World, the Hart of thee.
13 1781 How like a Deere, stroken by many Princes,
13 1782 Dost thou heere lye?
13 1783   Cassi. Mark Antony
13 1784 
13 1785    Ant. Pardon me Caius Cassius:
13 1786 The Enemies of Caesar, shall say this:
13 1787 Then, in a Friend, it is cold Modestie
13 1788 
13 1789    Cassi. I blame you not for praising Caesar so.
13 1790 But what compact meane you to haue with vs?
13 1791 Will you be prick'd in number of our Friends,
13 1792 Or shall we on, and not depend on you?
13 1793   Ant. Therefore I tooke your hands, but was indeed
13 1794 Sway'd from the point, by looking downe on Caesar.
13 1795 Friends am I with you all, and loue you all,
13 1796 Vpon this hope, that you shall giue me Reasons,
13 1797 Why, and wherein, Caesar was dangerous
13 1798 
13 1799    Bru. Or else were this a sauage Spectacle:
13 1800 Our Reasons are so full of good regard,
13 1801 That were you Antony, the Sonne of Caesar,
13 1802 You should be satisfied
13 1803 
13 1804    Ant. That's all I seeke,
13 1805 And am moreouer sutor, that I may
13 1806 Produce his body to the Market-place,
13 1807 And in the Pulpit as becomes a Friend,
13 1808 Speake in the Order of his Funerall
13 1809 
13 1810    Bru. You shall Marke Antony
13 1811 
13 1812    Cassi. Brutus, a word with you:
13 1813 You know not what you do; Do not consent
13 1814 That Antony speake in his Funerall:
13 1815 Know you how much the people may be mou'd
13 1816 By that which he will vtter
13 1817 
13 1818    Bru. By your pardon:
13 1819 I will my selfe into the Pulpit first,
13 1820 And shew the reason of our Caesars death.
13 1821 What Antony shall speake, I will protest
13 1822 He speakes by leaue, and by permission:
13 1823 And that we are contented Caesar shall
13 1824 Haue all true Rites, and lawfull Ceremonies,
13 1825 It shall aduantage more, then do vs wrong
13 1826 
13 1827    Cassi. I know not what may fall, I like it not
13 1828 
13 1829    Bru. Mark Antony, heere take you Caesars body:
13 1830 You shall not in your Funerall speech blame vs,
13 1831 But speake all good you can deuise of Caesar,
13 1832 And say you doo't by our permission:
13 1833 Else shall you not haue any hand at all
13 1834 About his Funerall. And you shall speake
13 1835 In the same Pulpit whereto I am going,
13 1836 After my speech is ended
13 1837 
13 1838    Ant. Be it so:
13 1839 I do desire no more
13 1840 
13 1841    Bru. Prepare the body then, and follow vs.
13 1842 
13 1843 Exeunt.
13 1844 
13 1845 Manet Antony.
13 1846 
13 1847 O pardon me, thou bleeding peece of Earth:
13 1848 That I am meeke and gentle with these Butchers.
13 1849 Thou art the Ruines of the Noblest man
13 1850 That euer liued in the Tide of Times.
13 1851 Woe to the hand that shed this costly Blood.
13 1852 Ouer thy wounds, now do I Prophesie,
13 1853 (Which like dumbe mouthes do ope their Ruby lips,
13 1854 To begge the voyce and vtterance of my Tongue)
13 1855 A Curse shall light vpon the limbes of men;
13 1856 Domesticke Fury, and fierce Ciuill strife,
13 1857 Shall cumber all the parts of Italy:
13 1858 Blood and destruction shall be so in vse,
13 1859 And dreadfull Obiects so familiar,
13 1860 That Mothers shall but smile, when they behold
13 1861 Their Infants quartered with the hands of Warre:
13 1862 All pitty choak'd with custome of fell deeds,
13 1863 And Caesars Spirit ranging for Reuenge,
13 1864 With Ate by his side, come hot from Hell,
13 1865 Shall in these Confines, with a Monarkes voyce,
13 1866 Cry hauocke, and let slip the Dogges of Warre,
13 1867 That this foule deede, shall smell aboue the earth
13 1868 With Carrion men, groaning for Buriall.
13 1869 Enter Octauio's Seruant.
13 1870 
13 1871 You serue Octauius Caesar, do you not?
13 1872   Ser. I do Marke Antony
13 1873 
13 1874    Ant. Caesar did write for him to come to Rome
13 1875 
13 1876    Ser. He did receiue his Letters, and is comming,
13 1877 And bid me say to you by word of mouth-
13 1878 O Caesar!
13 1879   Ant. Thy heart is bigge: get thee a-part and weepe:
13 1880 Passion I see is catching from mine eyes,
13 1881 Seeing those Beads of sorrow stand in thine,
13 1882 Began to water. Is thy Master comming?
13 1883   Ser. He lies to night within seuen Leagues of Rome
13 1884 
13 1885    Ant. Post backe with speede,
13 1886 And tell him what hath chanc'd:
13 1887 Heere is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome,
13 1888 No Rome of safety for Octauius yet,
13 1889 Hie hence, and tell him so. Yet stay a-while,
13 1890 Thou shalt not backe, till I haue borne this course
13 1891 Into the Market place: There shall I try
13 1892 In my Oration, how the People take
13 1893 The cruell issue of these bloody men,
13 1894 According to the which, thou shalt discourse
13 1895 To yong Octauius, of the state of things.
13 1896 Lend me your hand.
13 1897 
13 1898 Exeunt.
13 1899 
13 1900 Enter Brutus and goes into the Pulpit, and Cassius, with the
13 1901 Plebeians.
13 1902 
13 1903   Ple. We will be satisfied: let vs be satisfied
13 1904 
13 1905    Bru. Then follow me, and giue me Audience friends.
13 1906 Cassius go you into the other streete,
13 1907 And part the Numbers:
13 1908 Those that will heare me speake, let 'em stay heere;
13 1909 Those that will follow Cassius, go with him,
13 1910 And publike Reasons shall be rendred
13 1911 Of Caesars death
13 1912 
13 1913    1.Ple. I will heare Brutus speake
13 1914 
13 1915    2. I will heare Cassius, and compare their Reasons,
13 1916 When seuerally we heare them rendred
13 1917 
13 1918    3. The Noble Brutus is ascended: Silence
13 1919 
13 1920    Bru. Be patient till the last.
13 1921 Romans, Countrey-men, and Louers, heare mee for my
13 1922 cause, and be silent, that you may heare. Beleeue me for
13 1923 mine Honor, and haue respect to mine Honor, that you
13 1924 may beleeue. Censure me in your Wisedom, and awake
13 1925 your Senses, that you may the better Iudge. If there bee
13 1926 any in this Assembly, any deere Friend of Caesars, to him
13 1927 I say, that Brutus loue to Caesar, was no lesse then his. If
13 1928 then, that Friend demand, why Brutus rose against Caesar,
13 1929 this is my answer: Not that I lou'd Caesar lesse, but
13 1930 that I lou'd Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were liuing,
13 1931 and dye all Slaues; then that Caesar were dead, to
13 1932 liue all Free-men? As Caesar lou'd mee, I weepe for him;
13 1933 as he was Fortunate, I reioyce at it; as he was Valiant, I
13 1934 honour him: But, as he was Ambitious, I slew him. There
13 1935 is Teares, for his Loue: Ioy, for his Fortune: Honor, for
13 1936 his Valour: and Death, for his Ambition. Who is heere
13 1937 so base, that would be a Bondman? If any, speak, for him
13 1938 haue I offended. Who is heere so rude, that would not
13 1939 be a Roman? If any, speak, for him haue I offended. Who
13 1940 is heere so vile, that will not loue his Countrey? If any,
13 1941 speake, for him haue I offended. I pause for a Reply
13 1942 
13 1943    All. None Brutus, none
13 1944 
13 1945    Brutus. Then none haue I offended. I haue done no
13 1946 more to Caesar, then you shall do to Brutus. The Question
13 1947 of his death, is inroll'd in the Capitoll: his Glory not
13 1948 extenuated, wherein he was worthy; nor his offences enforc'd,
13 1949 for which he suffered death.
13 1950 Enter Mark Antony, with Caesars body.
13 1951 
13 1952 Heere comes his Body, mourn'd by Marke Antony, who
13 1953 though he had no hand in his death, shall receiue the benefit
13 1954 of his dying, a place in the Co[m]monwealth, as which
13 1955 of you shall not. With this I depart, that as I slewe my
13 1956 best Louer for the good of Rome, I haue the same Dagger
13 1957 for my selfe, when it shall please my Country to need
13 1958 my death
13 1959 
13 1960    All. Liue Brutus, liue, liue
13 1961 
13 1962    1. Bring him with Triumph home vnto his house
13 1963 
13 1964    2. Giue him a Statue with his Ancestors
13 1965 
13 1966    3. Let him be Caesar
13 1967 
13 1968    4. Caesars better parts,
13 1969 Shall be Crown'd in Brutus
13 1970 
13 1971    1. Wee'l bring him to his House,
13 1972 With Showts and Clamors
13 1973 
13 1974    Bru. My Country-men
13 1975 
13 1976    2. Peace, silence, Brutus speakes
13 1977 
13 1978    1. Peace ho
13 1979 
13 1980    Bru. Good Countrymen, let me depart alone,
13 1981 And (for my sake) stay heere with Antony:
13 1982 Do grace to Caesars Corpes, and grace his Speech
13 1983 Tending to Caesars Glories, which Marke Antony
13 1984 (By our permission) is allow'd to make.
13 1985 I do intreat you, not a man depart,
13 1986 Saue I alone, till Antony haue spoke.
13 1987 
13 1988 Exit
13 1989 
13 1990   1 Stay ho, and let vs heare Mark Antony
13 1991 
13 1992    3 Let him go vp into the publike Chaire,
13 1993 Wee'l heare him: Noble Antony go vp
13 1994 
13 1995    Ant. For Brutus sake, I am beholding to you
13 1996 
13 1997    4 What does he say of Brutus?
13 1998   3 He sayes, for Brutus sake
13 1999 He findes himselfe beholding to vs all
13 2000 
13 2001    4 'Twere best he speake no harme of Brutus heere?
13 2002   1 This Caesar was a Tyrant
13 2003 
13 2004    3 Nay that's certaine:
13 2005 We are blest that Rome is rid of him
13 2006 
13 2007    2 Peace, let vs heare what Antony can say
13 2008 
13 2009    Ant. You gentle Romans
13 2010 
13 2011    All. Peace hoe, let vs heare him
13 2012 
13 2013    An. Friends, Romans, Countrymen, lend me your ears:
13 2014 I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him:
13 2015 The euill that men do, liues after them,
13 2016 The good is oft enterred with their bones,
13 2017 So let it be with Caesar. The Noble Brutus,
13 2018 Hath told you Caesar was Ambitious:
13 2019 If it were so, it was a greeuous Fault,
13 2020 And greeuously hath Caesar answer'd it.
13 2021 Heere, vnder leaue of Brutus, and the rest
13 2022 (For Brutus is an Honourable man,
13 2023 So are they all; all Honourable men)
13 2024 Come I to speake in Caesars Funerall.
13 2025 He was my Friend, faithfull, and iust to me;
13 2026 But Brutus sayes, he was Ambitious,
13 2027 And Brutus is an Honourable man.
13 2028 He hath brought many Captiues home to Rome,
13 2029 Whose Ransomes, did the generall Coffers fill:
13 2030 Did this in Caesar seeme Ambitious?
13 2031 When that the poore haue cry'de, Caesar hath wept:
13 2032 Ambition should be made of sterner stuffe,
13 2033 Yet Brutus sayes, he was Ambitious:
13 2034 And Brutus is an Honourable man.
13 2035 You all did see, that on the Lupercall,
13 2036 I thrice presented him a Kingly Crowne,
13 2037 Which he did thrice refuse. Was this Ambition?
13 2038 Yet Brutus sayes, he was Ambitious:
13 2039 And sure he is an Honourable man.
13 2040 I speake not to disprooue what Brutus spoke,
13 2041 But heere I am, to speake what I do know;
13 2042 You all did loue him once, not without cause,
13 2043 What cause with-holds you then, to mourne for him?
13 2044 O Iudgement! thou are fled to brutish Beasts,
13 2045 And Men haue lost their Reason. Beare with me,
13 2046 My heart is in the Coffin there with Caesar,
13 2047 And I must pawse, till it come backe to me
13 2048 
13 2049    1 Me thinkes there is much reason in his sayings
13 2050 
13 2051    2 If thou consider rightly of the matter,
13 2052 Caesar ha's had great wrong
13 2053 
13 2054    3 Ha's hee Masters? I feare there will a worse come in his place
13 2055 
13 2056    4. Mark'd ye his words? he would not take y Crown,
13 2057 Therefore 'tis certaine, he was not Ambitious
13 2058 
13 2059    1. If it be found so, some will deere abide it
13 2060 
13 2061    2. Poore soule, his eyes are red as fire with weeping
13 2062 
13 2063    3. There's not a Nobler man in Rome then Antony
13 2064 
13 2065    4. Now marke him, he begins againe to speake
13 2066 
13 2067    Ant. But yesterday, the word of Caesar might
13 2068 Haue stood against the World: Now lies he there,
13 2069 And none so poore to do him reuerence.
13 2070 O Maisters! If I were dispos'd to stirre
13 2071 Your hearts and mindes to Mutiny and Rage,
13 2072 I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong:
13 2073 Who (you all know) are Honourable men.
13 2074 I will not do them wrong: I rather choose
13 2075 To wrong the dead, to wrong my selfe and you,
13 2076 Then I will wrong such Honourable men.
13 2077 But heere's a Parchment, with the Seale of Caesar,
13 2078 I found it in his Closset, 'tis his Will:
13 2079 Let but the Commons heare this Testament:
13 2080 (Which pardon me) I do not meane to reade,
13 2081 And they would go and kisse dead Caesars wounds,
13 2082 And dip their Napkins in his Sacred Blood;
13 2083 Yea, begge a haire of him for Memory,
13 2084 And dying, mention it within their Willes,
13 2085 Bequeathing it as a rich Legacie
13 2086 Vnto their issue
13 2087 
13 2088    4 Wee'l heare the Will, reade it Marke Antony
13 2089 
13 2090    All. The Will, the Will; we will heare Caesars Will
13 2091 
13 2092    Ant. Haue patience gentle Friends, I must not read it.
13 2093 It is not meete you know how Caesar lou'd you:
13 2094 You are not Wood, you are not Stones, but men:
13 2095 And being men, hearing the Will of Caesar,
13 2096 It will inflame you, it will make you mad:
13 2097 'Tis good you know not that you are his Heires,
13 2098 For if you should, O what would come of it?
13 2099   4 Read the Will, wee'l heare it Antony:
13 2100 You shall reade vs the Will, Caesars Will
13 2101 
13 2102    Ant. Will you be Patient? Will you stay a-while?
13 2103 I haue o're-shot my selfe to tell you of it,
13 2104 I feare I wrong the Honourable men,
13 2105 Whose Daggers haue stabb'd Caesar: I do feare it
13 2106 
13 2107    4 They were Traitors: Honourable men?
13 2108   All. The Will, the Testament
13 2109 
13 2110    2 They were Villaines, Murderers: the Will, read the
13 2111 Will
13 2112 
13 2113    Ant. You will compell me then to read the Will:
13 2114 Then make a Ring about the Corpes of Caesar,
13 2115 And let me shew you him that made the Will:
13 2116 Shall I descend? And will you giue me leaue?
13 2117   All. Come downe
13 2118 
13 2119    2 Descend
13 2120 
13 2121    3 You shall haue leaue
13 2122 
13 2123    4 A Ring, stand round
13 2124 
13 2125    1 Stand from the Hearse, stand from the Body
13 2126 
13 2127    2 Roome for Antony, most Noble Antony
13 2128 
13 2129    Ant. Nay presse not so vpon me, stand farre off
13 2130 
13 2131    All. Stand backe: roome, beare backe
13 2132 
13 2133    Ant. If you haue teares, prepare to shed them now.
13 2134 You all do know this Mantle, I remember
13 2135 The first time euer Caesar put it on,
13 2136 'Twas on a Summers Euening in his Tent,
13 2137 That day he ouercame the Neruij.
13 2138 Looke, in this place ran Cassius Dagger through:
13 2139 See what a rent the enuious Caska made:
13 2140 Through this, the wel-beloued Brutus stabb'd,
13 2141 And as he pluck'd his cursed Steele away:
13 2142 Marke how the blood of Caesar followed it,
13 2143 As rushing out of doores, to be resolu'd
13 2144 If Brutus so vnkindely knock'd, or no:
13 2145 For Brutus, as you know, was Caesars Angel.
13 2146 Iudge, O you Gods, how deerely Caesar lou'd him:
13 2147 This was the most vnkindest cut of all.
13 2148 For when the Noble Caesar saw him stab,
13 2149 Ingratitude, more strong then Traitors armes,
13 2150 Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his Mighty heart,
13 2151 And in his Mantle, muffling vp his face,
13 2152 Euen at the Base of Pompeyes Statue
13 2153 (Which all the while ran blood) great Caesar fell.
13 2154 O what a fall was there, my Countrymen?
13 2155 Then I, and you, and all of vs fell downe,
13 2156 Whil'st bloody Treason flourish'd ouer vs.
13 2157 O now you weepe, and I perceiue you feele
13 2158 The dint of pitty: These are gracious droppes.
13 2159 Kinde Soules, what weepe you, when you but behold
13 2160 Our Caesars Vesture wounded? Looke you heere,
13 2161 Heere is Himselfe, marr'd as you see with Traitors
13 2162 
13 2163    1. O pitteous spectacle!
13 2164   2. O Noble Caesar!
13 2165   3. O wofull day!
13 2166   4. O Traitors, Villaines!
13 2167   1. O most bloody sight!
13 2168   2. We will be reueng'd: Reuenge
13 2169 About, seeke, burne, fire, kill, slay,
13 2170 Let not a Traitor liue
13 2171 
13 2172    Ant. Stay Country-men
13 2173 
13 2174    1. Peace there, heare the Noble Antony
13 2175 
13 2176    2. Wee'l heare him, wee'l follow him, wee'l dy with
13 2177 him
13 2178 
13 2179    Ant. Good Friends, sweet Friends, let me not stirre you vp
13 2180 To such a sodaine Flood of Mutiny:
13 2181 They that haue done this Deede, are honourable.
13 2182 What priuate greefes they haue, alas I know not,
13 2183 That made them do it: They are Wise, and Honourable,
13 2184 And will no doubt with Reasons answer you.
13 2185 I come not (Friends) to steale away your hearts,
13 2186 I am no Orator, as Brutus is:
13 2187 But (as you know me all) a plaine blunt man
13 2188 That loue my Friend, and that they know full well,
13 2189 That gaue me publike leaue to speake of him:
13 2190 For I haue neyther writ nor words, nor worth,
13 2191 Action, nor Vtterance, nor the power of Speech,
13 2192 To stirre mens Blood. I onely speake right on:
13 2193 I tell you that, which you your selues do know,
13 2194 Shew you sweet Caesars wounds, poor poor dum mouths
13 2195 And bid them speake for me: But were I Brutus,
13 2196 And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony
13 2197 Would ruffle vp your Spirits, and put a Tongue
13 2198 In euery Wound of Caesar, that should moue
13 2199 The stones of Rome, to rise and Mutiny
13 2200 
13 2201    All. Wee'l Mutiny
13 2202 
13 2203    1 Wee'l burne the house of Brutus
13 2204 
13 2205    3 Away then, come, seeke the Conspirators
13 2206 
13 2207    Ant. Yet heare me Countrymen, yet heare me speake
13 2208   All. Peace hoe, heare Antony, most Noble Antony
13 2209 
13 2210    Ant. Why Friends, you go to do you know not what:
13 2211 Wherein hath Caesar thus deseru'd your loues?
13 2212 Alas you know not, I must tell you then:
13 2213 You haue forgot the Will I told you of
13 2214 
13 2215    All. Most true, the Will, let's stay and heare the Wil
13 2216 
13 2217    Ant. Heere is the Will, and vnder Caesars Seale:
13 2218 To euery Roman Citizen he giues,
13 2219 To euery seuerall man, seuenty fiue Drachmaes
13 2220 
13 2221    2 Ple. Most Noble Caesar, wee'l reuenge his death
13 2222 
13 2223    3 Ple. O Royall Caesar
13 2224 
13 2225    Ant. Heare me with patience
13 2226 
13 2227    All. Peace hoe
13 2228   Ant. Moreouer, he hath left you all his Walkes,
13 2229 His priuate Arbors, and new-planted Orchards,
13 2230 On this side Tyber, he hath left them you,
13 2231 And to your heyres for euer: common pleasures
13 2232 To walke abroad, and recreate your selues.
13 2233 Heere was a Caesar: when comes such another?
13 2234   1.Ple. Neuer, neuer: come, away, away:
13 2235 Wee'l burne his body in the holy place,
13 2236 And with the Brands fire the Traitors houses.
13 2237 Take vp the body
13 2238 
13 2239    2.Ple. Go fetch fire
13 2240 
13 2241    3.Ple. Plucke downe Benches
13 2242 
13 2243    4.Ple. Plucke downe Formes, Windowes, any thing.
13 2244 
13 2245 Exit Plebeians.
13 2246 
13 2247   Ant. Now let it worke: Mischeefe thou art a-foot,
13 2248 Take thou what course thou wilt.
13 2249 How now Fellow?
13 2250 Enter Seruant.
13 2251 
13 2252   Ser. Sir, Octauius is already come to Rome
13 2253 
13 2254    Ant. Where is hee?
13 2255   Ser. He and Lepidus are at Caesars house
13 2256 
13 2257    Ant. And thither will I straight, to visit him:
13 2258 He comes vpon a wish. Fortune is merry,
13 2259 And in this mood will giue vs any thing
13 2260 
13 2261    Ser. I heard him say, Brutus and Cassius
13 2262 Are rid like Madmen through the Gates of Rome
13 2263 
13 2264    Ant. Belike they had some notice of the people
13 2265 How I had moued them. Bring me to Octauius.
13 2266 
13 2267 Exeunt.
13 2268 
13 2269 Enter Cinna the Poet, and after him the Plebeians.
13 2270 
13 2271   Cinna. I dreamt to night, that I did feast with Caesar,
13 2272 And things vnluckily charge my Fantasie:
13 2273 I haue no will to wander foorth of doores,
13 2274 Yet something leads me foorth
13 2275 
13 2276    1. What is your name?
13 2277   2. Whether are you going?
13 2278   3. Where do you dwell?
13 2279   4. Are you a married man, or a Batchellor?
13 2280   2. Answer euery man directly
13 2281 
13 2282    1. I, and breefely
13 2283 
13 2284    4. I, and wisely
13 2285 
13 2286    3. I, and truly, you were best
13 2287 
13 2288    Cin. What is my name? Whether am I going? Where
13 2289 do I dwell? Am I a married man, or a Batchellour? Then
13 2290 to answer euery man, directly and breefely, wisely and
13 2291 truly: wisely I say, I am a Batchellor
13 2292 
13 2293    2 That's as much as to say, they are fooles that marrie:
13 2294 you'l beare me a bang for that I feare: proceede directly
13 2295 
13 2296    Cinna. Directly I am going to Caesars Funerall
13 2297 
13 2298    1. As a Friend, or an Enemy?
13 2299   Cinna. As a friend
13 2300 
13 2301    2. That matter is answered directly
13 2302 
13 2303    4. For your dwelling: breefely
13 2304 
13 2305    Cinna. Breefely, I dwell by the Capitoll
13 2306 
13 2307    3. Your name sir, truly
13 2308 
13 2309    Cinna. Truly, my name is Cinna
13 2310 
13 2311    1. Teare him to peeces, hee's a Conspirator
13 2312 
13 2313    Cinna. I am Cinna the Poet, I am Cinna the Poet
13 2314 
13 2315    4. Teare him for his bad verses, teare him for his bad
13 2316 Verses
13 2317 
13 2318    Cin. I am not Cinna the Conspirator
13 2319 
13 2320    4. It is no matter, his name's Cinna, plucke but his
13 2321 name out of his heart, and turne him going
13 2322 
13 2323    3. Teare him, tear him; Come Brands hoe, Firebrands:
13 2324 to Brutus, to Cassius, burne all. Some to Decius House,
13 2325 and some to Caska's; some to Ligarius: Away, go.
13 2326 
13 2327 Exeunt. all the Plebeians.
13 2328 
13 2329 
13 2330 Actus Quartus.
13 2331 
13 2332 Enter Antony, Octauius, and Lepidus.
13 2333 
13 2334   Ant. These many then shall die, their names are prickt
13 2335   Octa. Your Brother too must dye: consent you Lepidus?
13 2336   Lep. I do consent
13 2337 
13 2338    Octa. Pricke him downe Antony
13 2339 
13 2340    Lep. Vpon condition Publius shall not liue,
13 2341 Who is your Sisters sonne, Marke Antony
13 2342 
13 2343    Ant. He shall not liue; looke, with a spot I dam him.
13 2344 But Lepidus, go you to Caesars house:
13 2345 Fetch the Will hither, and we shall determine
13 2346 How to cut off some charge in Legacies
13 2347 
13 2348    Lep. What? shall I finde you heere?
13 2349   Octa. Or heere, or at the Capitoll.
13 2350 
13 2351 Exit Lepidus
13 2352 
13 2353   Ant. This is a slight vnmeritable man,
13 2354 Meet to be sent on Errands: is it fit
13 2355 The three-fold World diuided, he should stand
13 2356 One of the three to share it?
13 2357   Octa. So you thought him,
13 2358 And tooke his voyce who should be prickt to dye
13 2359 In our blacke Sentence and Proscription
13 2360 
13 2361    Ant. Octauius, I haue seene more dayes then you,
13 2362 And though we lay these Honours on this man,
13 2363 To ease our selues of diuers sland'rous loads,
13 2364 He shall but beare them, as the Asse beares Gold,
13 2365 To groane and swet vnder the Businesse,
13 2366 Either led or driuen, as we point the way:
13 2367 And hauing brought our Treasure, where we will,
13 2368 Then take we downe his Load, and turne him off
13 2369 (Like to the empty Asse) to shake his eares,
13 2370 And graze in Commons
13 2371 
13 2372    Octa. You may do your will:
13 2373 But hee's a tried, and valiant Souldier
13 2374 
13 2375    Ant. So is my Horse Octauius, and for that
13 2376 I do appoint him store of Prouender.
13 2377 It is a Creature that I teach to fight,
13 2378 To winde, to stop, to run directly on:
13 2379 His corporall Motion, gouern'd by my Spirit,
13 2380 And in some taste, is Lepidus but so:
13 2381 He must be taught, and train'd, and bid go forth:
13 2382 A barren spirited Fellow; one that feeds
13 2383 On Obiects, Arts, and Imitations.
13 2384 Which out of vse, and stal'de by other men
13 2385 Begin his fashion. Do not talke of him,
13 2386 But as a property: and now Octauius,
13 2387 Listen great things. Brutus and Cassius
13 2388 Are leuying Powers; We must straight make head:
13 2389 Therefore let our Alliance be combin'd,
13 2390 Our best Friends made, our meanes stretcht,
13 2391 And let vs presently go sit in Councell,
13 2392 How couert matters may be best disclos'd,
13 2393 And open Perils surest answered
13 2394 
13 2395    Octa. Let vs do so: for we are at the stake,
13 2396 And bayed about with many Enemies,
13 2397 And some that smile haue in their hearts I feare
13 2398 Millions of Mischeefes.
13 2399 
13 2400 Exeunt.
13 2401 
13 2402 Drum. Enter Brutus, Lucillius, and the Army. Titinius and
13 2403 Pindarus meete
13 2404 them.
13 2405 
13 2406   Bru. Stand ho
13 2407 
13 2408    Lucil. Giue the word ho, and Stand
13 2409 
13 2410    Bru. What now Lucillius, is Cassius neere?
13 2411   Lucil. He is at hand, and Pindarus is come
13 2412 To do you salutation from his Master
13 2413 
13 2414    Bru. He greets me well. Your Master Pindarus
13 2415 In his owne change, or by ill Officers,
13 2416 Hath giuen me some worthy cause to wish
13 2417 Things done, vndone: But if he be at hand
13 2418 I shall be satisfied
13 2419 
13 2420    Pin. I do not doubt
13 2421 But that my Noble Master will appeare
13 2422 Such as he is, full of regard, and Honour
13 2423 
13 2424    Bru. He is not doubted. A word Lucillius
13 2425 How he receiu'd you: let me be resolu'd
13 2426 
13 2427    Lucil. With courtesie, and with respect enough,
13 2428 But not with such familiar instances,
13 2429 Nor with such free and friendly Conference
13 2430 As he hath vs'd of old
13 2431 
13 2432    Bru. Thou hast describ'd
13 2433 A hot Friend, cooling: Euer note Lucillius,
13 2434 When Loue begins to sicken and decay
13 2435 It vseth an enforced Ceremony.
13 2436 There are no trickes, in plaine and simple Faith:
13 2437 But hollow men, like Horses hot at hand,
13 2438 Make gallant shew, and promise of their Mettle:
13 2439 
13 2440 Low March within.
13 2441 
13 2442 But when they should endure the bloody Spurre,
13 2443 They fall their Crests, and like deceitfull Iades
13 2444 Sinke in the Triall. Comes his Army on?
13 2445   Lucil. They meane this night in Sardis to be quarter'd:
13 2446 The greater part, the Horse in generall
13 2447 Are come with Cassius.
13 2448 Enter Cassius and his Powers.
13 2449 
13 2450   Bru. Hearke, he is arriu'd:
13 2451 March gently on to meete him
13 2452 
13 2453    Cassi. Stand ho
13 2454 
13 2455    Bru. Stand ho, speake the word along.
13 2456 Stand.
13 2457 Stand.
13 2458 Stand
13 2459 
13 2460    Cassi. Most Noble Brother, you haue done me wrong
13 2461 
13 2462    Bru. Iudge me you Gods; wrong I mine Enemies?
13 2463 And if not so, how should I wrong a Brother
13 2464 
13 2465    Cassi. Brutus, this sober forme of yours, hides wrongs,
13 2466 And when you do them-
13 2467   Brut. Cassius, be content,
13 2468 Speake your greefes softly, I do know you well.
13 2469 Before the eyes of both our Armies heere
13 2470 (Which should perceiue nothing but Loue from vs)
13 2471 Let vs not wrangle. Bid them moue away:
13 2472 Then in my Tent Cassius enlarge your Greefes,
13 2473 And I will giue you Audience
13 2474 
13 2475    Cassi. Pindarus,
13 2476 Bid our Commanders leade their Charges off
13 2477 A little from this ground
13 2478 
13 2479    Bru. Lucillius, do you the like, and let no man
13 2480 Come to our Tent, till we haue done our Conference.
13 2481 Let Lucius and Titinius guard our doore.
13 2482 
13 2483 Exeunt.
13 2484 
13 2485 Manet Brutus and Cassius.
13 2486 
13 2487   Cassi. That you haue wrong'd me, doth appear in this:
13 2488 You haue condemn'd, and noted Lucius Pella
13 2489 For taking Bribes heere of the Sardians;
13 2490 Wherein my Letters, praying on his side,
13 2491 Because I knew the man was slighted off
13 2492 
13 2493    Bru. You wrong'd your selfe to write in such a case
13 2494 
13 2495    Cassi. In such a time as this, it is not meet
13 2496 That euery nice offence should beare his Comment
13 2497 
13 2498    Bru. Let me tell you Cassius, you your selfe
13 2499 Are much condemn'd to haue an itching Palme,
13 2500 To sell, and Mart your Offices for Gold
13 2501 To Vndeseruers
13 2502 
13 2503    Cassi. I, an itching Palme?
13 2504 You know that you are Brutus that speakes this,
13 2505 Or by the Gods, this speech were else your last
13 2506 
13 2507    Bru. The name of Cassius Honors this corruption,
13 2508 And Chasticement doth therefore hide his head
13 2509 
13 2510    Cassi. Chasticement?
13 2511   Bru. Remember March, the Ides of March reme[m]ber:
13 2512 Did not great Iulius bleede for Iustice sake?
13 2513 What Villaine touch'd his body, that did stab,
13 2514 And not for Iustice? What? Shall one of Vs,
13 2515 That strucke the Formost man of all this World,
13 2516 But for supporting Robbers: shall we now,
13 2517 Contaminate our fingers, with base Bribes?
13 2518 And sell the mighty space of our large Honors
13 2519 For so much trash, as may be grasped thus?
13 2520 I had rather be a Dogge, and bay the Moone,
13 2521 Then such a Roman
13 2522 
13 2523    Cassi. Brutus, baite not me,
13 2524 Ile not indure it: you forget your selfe
13 2525 To hedge me in. I am a Souldier, I,
13 2526 Older in practice, Abler then your selfe
13 2527 To make Conditions
13 2528 
13 2529    Bru. Go too: you are not Cassius
13 2530 
13 2531    Cassi. I am
13 2532 
13 2533    Bru. I say, you are not
13 2534 
13 2535    Cassi. Vrge me no more, I shall forget my selfe:
13 2536 Haue minde vpon your health: Tempt me no farther
13 2537 
13 2538    Bru. Away slight man
13 2539 
13 2540    Cassi. Is't possible?
13 2541   Bru. Heare me, for I will speake.
13 2542 Must I giue way, and roome to your rash Choller?
13 2543 Shall I be frighted, when a Madman stares?
13 2544   Cassi. O ye Gods, ye Gods, Must I endure all this?
13 2545   Bru. All this? I more: Fret till your proud hart break.
13 2546 Go shew your Slaues how Chollericke you are,
13 2547 And make your Bondmen tremble. Must I bouge?
13 2548 Must I obserue you? Must I stand and crouch
13 2549 Vnder your Testie Humour? By the Gods,
13 2550 You shall digest the Venom of your Spleene
13 2551 Though it do Split you. For, from this day forth,
13 2552 Ile vse you for my Mirth, yea for my Laughter
13 2553 When you are Waspish
13 2554 
13 2555    Cassi. Is it come to this?
13 2556   Bru. You say, you are a better Souldier:
13 2557 Let it appeare so; make your vaunting true,
13 2558 And it shall please me well. For mine owne part,
13 2559 I shall be glad to learne of Noble men
13 2560 
13 2561    Cass. You wrong me euery way:
13 2562 You wrong me Brutus:
13 2563 I saide, an Elder Souldier, not a Better.
13 2564 Did I say Better?
13 2565   Bru. If you did, I care not
13 2566 
13 2567    Cass. When Caesar liu'd, he durst not thus haue mou'd me
13 2568 
13 2569    Brut. Peace, peace, you durst not so haue tempted him
13 2570 
13 2571    Cassi. I durst not
13 2572 
13 2573    Bru. No
13 2574 
13 2575    Cassi. What? durst not tempt him?
13 2576   Bru. For your life you durst not
13 2577 
13 2578    Cassi. Do not presume too much vpon my Loue,
13 2579 I may do that I shall be sorry for
13 2580 
13 2581    Bru. You haue done that you should be sorry for.
13 2582 There is no terror Cassius in your threats:
13 2583 For I am Arm'd so strong in Honesty,
13 2584 That they passe by me, as the idle winde,
13 2585 Which I respect not. I did send to you
13 2586 For certaine summes of Gold, which you deny'd me,
13 2587 For I can raise no money by vile meanes:
13 2588 By Heauen, I had rather Coine my Heart,
13 2589 And drop my blood for Drachmaes, then to wring
13 2590 From the hard hands of Peazants, their vile trash
13 2591 By any indirection. I did send
13 2592 To you for Gold to pay my Legions,
13 2593 Which you deny'd me: was that done like Cassius?
13 2594 Should I haue answer'd Caius Cassius so?
13 2595 When Marcus Brutus growes so Couetous,
13 2596 To locke such Rascall Counters from his Friends,
13 2597 Be ready Gods with all your Thunder-bolts,
13 2598 Dash him to peeces
13 2599 
13 2600    Cassi. I deny'd you not
13 2601 
13 2602    Bru. You did
13 2603 
13 2604    Cassi. I did not. He was but a Foole
13 2605 That brought my answer back. Brutus hath riu'd my hart:
13 2606 A Friend should beare his Friends infirmities;
13 2607 But Brutus makes mine greater then they are
13 2608 
13 2609    Bru. I do not, till you practice them on me
13 2610 
13 2611    Cassi. You loue me not
13 2612 
13 2613    Bru. I do not like your faults
13 2614 
13 2615    Cassi. A friendly eye could neuer see such faults
13 2616 
13 2617    Bru. A Flatterers would not, though they do appeare
13 2618 As huge as high Olympus
13 2619 
13 2620    Cassi. Come Antony, and yong Octauius come,
13 2621 Reuenge your selues alone on Cassius,
13 2622 For Cassius is a-weary of the World:
13 2623 Hated by one he loues, brau'd by his Brother,
13 2624 Check'd like a bondman, all his faults obseru'd,
13 2625 Set in a Note-booke, learn'd, and con'd by roate
13 2626 To cast into my Teeth. O I could weepe
13 2627 My Spirit from mine eyes. There is my Dagger,
13 2628 And heere my naked Breast: Within, a Heart
13 2629 Deerer then Pluto's Mine, Richer then Gold:
13 2630 If that thou bee'st a Roman, take it foorth.
13 2631 I that deny'd thee Gold, will giue my Heart:
13 2632 Strike as thou did'st at Caesar: For I know,
13 2633 When thou did'st hate him worst, y loued'st him better
13 2634 Then euer thou loued'st Cassius
13 2635 
13 2636    Bru. Sheath your Dagger:
13 2637 Be angry when you will, it shall haue scope:
13 2638 Do what you will, Dishonor, shall be Humour.
13 2639 O Cassius, you are yoaked with a Lambe
13 2640 That carries Anger, as the Flint beares fire,
13 2641 Who much inforced, shewes a hastie Sparke,
13 2642 And straite is cold agen
13 2643 
13 2644    Cassi. Hath Cassius liu'd
13 2645 To be but Mirth and Laughter to his Brutus,
13 2646 When greefe and blood ill temper'd, vexeth him?
13 2647   Bru. When I spoke that, I was ill temper'd too
13 2648 
13 2649    Cassi. Do you confesse so much? Giue me your hand
13 2650 
13 2651    Bru. And my heart too
13 2652 
13 2653    Cassi. O Brutus!
13 2654   Bru. What's the matter?
13 2655   Cassi. Haue not you loue enough to beare with me,
13 2656 When that rash humour which my Mother gaue me
13 2657 Makes me forgetfull
13 2658 
13 2659    Bru. Yes Cassius, and from henceforth
13 2660 When you are ouer-earnest with your Brutus,
13 2661 Hee'l thinke your Mother chides, and leaue you so.
13 2662 Enter a Poet.
13 2663 
13 2664   Poet. Let me go in to see the Generals,
13 2665 There is some grudge betweene 'em, 'tis not meete
13 2666 They be alone
13 2667 
13 2668    Lucil. You shall not come to them
13 2669 
13 2670    Poet. Nothing but death shall stay me
13 2671 
13 2672    Cas. How now? What's the matter?
13 2673   Poet. For shame you Generals; what do you meane?
13 2674 Loue, and be Friends, as two such men should bee,
13 2675 For I haue seene more yeeres I'me sure then yee
13 2676 
13 2677    Cas. Ha, ha, how vildely doth this Cynicke rime?
13 2678   Bru. Get you hence sirra: Sawcy Fellow, hence
13 2679 
13 2680    Cas. Beare with him Brutus, 'tis his fashion
13 2681 
13 2682    Brut. Ile know his humor, when he knowes his time:
13 2683 What should the Warres do with these Iigging Fooles?
13 2684 Companion, hence
13 2685 
13 2686    Cas. Away, away be gone.
13 2687 
13 2688 Exit Poet
13 2689 
13 2690   Bru. Lucillius and Titinius bid the Commanders
13 2691 Prepare to lodge their Companies to night
13 2692 
13 2693    Cas. And come your selues, & bring Messala with you
13 2694 Immediately to vs
13 2695 
13 2696    Bru. Lucius, a bowle of Wine
13 2697 
13 2698    Cas. I did not thinke you could haue bin so angry
13 2699 
13 2700    Bru. O Cassius, I am sicke of many greefes
13 2701 
13 2702    Cas. Of your Philosophy you make no vse,
13 2703 If you giue place to accidentall euils
13 2704 
13 2705    Bru. No man beares sorrow better. Portia is dead
13 2706 
13 2707    Cas. Ha? Portia?
13 2708   Bru. She is dead
13 2709 
13 2710    Cas. How scap'd I killing, when I crost you so?
13 2711 O insupportable, and touching losse!
13 2712 Vpon what sicknesse?
13 2713   Bru. Impatient of my absence,
13 2714 And greefe, that yong Octauius with Mark Antony
13 2715 Haue made themselues so strong: For with her death
13 2716 That tydings came. With this she fell distract,
13 2717 And (her Attendants absent) swallow'd fire
13 2718 
13 2719    Cas. And dy'd so?
13 2720   Bru. Euen so
13 2721 
13 2722    Cas. O ye immortall Gods!
13 2723 Enter Boy with Wine, and Tapers.
13 2724 
13 2725   Bru. Speak no more of her: Giue me a bowl of wine,
13 2726 In this I bury all vnkindnesse Cassius.
13 2727 
13 2728 Drinkes
13 2729 
13 2730   Cas. My heart is thirsty for that Noble pledge.
13 2731 Fill Lucius, till the Wine ore-swell the Cup:
13 2732 I cannot drinke too much of Brutus loue.
13 2733 Enter Titinius and Messala.
13 2734 
13 2735   Brutus. Come in Titinius:
13 2736 Welcome good Messala:
13 2737 Now sit we close about this Taper heere,
13 2738 And call in question our necessities
13 2739 
13 2740    Cass. Portia, art thou gone?
13 2741   Bru. No more I pray you.
13 2742 Messala, I haue heere receiued Letters,
13 2743 That yong Octauius, and Marke Antony
13 2744 Come downe vpon vs with a mighty power,
13 2745 Bending their Expedition toward Philippi
13 2746 
13 2747    Mess. My selfe haue Letters of the selfe-same Tenure
13 2748 
13 2749    Bru. With what Addition
13 2750 
13 2751    Mess. That by proscription, and billes of Outlarie,
13 2752 Octauius, Antony, and Lepidus,
13 2753 Haue put to death, an hundred Senators
13 2754 
13 2755    Bru. Therein our Letters do not well agree:
13 2756 Mine speake of seuenty Senators, that dy'de
13 2757 By their proscriptions, Cicero being one
13 2758 
13 2759    Cassi. Cicero one?
13 2760   Messa. Cicero is dead, and by that order of proscription
13 2761 Had you your Letters from your wife, my Lord?
13 2762   Bru. No Messala
13 2763 
13 2764    Messa. Nor nothing in your Letters writ of her?
13 2765   Bru. Nothing Messala
13 2766 
13 2767    Messa. That me thinkes is strange
13 2768 
13 2769    Bru. Why aske you?
13 2770 Heare you ought of her, in yours?
13 2771   Messa. No my Lord
13 2772 
13 2773    Bru. Now as you are a Roman tell me true
13 2774 
13 2775    Messa. Then like a Roman, beare the truth I tell,
13 2776 For certaine she is dead, and by strange manner
13 2777 
13 2778    Bru. Why farewell Portia: We must die Messala:
13 2779 With meditating that she must dye once,
13 2780 I haue the patience to endure it now
13 2781 
13 2782    Messa. Euen so great men, great losses shold indure
13 2783 
13 2784    Cassi. I haue as much of this in Art as you,
13 2785 But yet my Nature could not beare it so
13 2786 
13 2787    Bru. Well, to our worke aliue. What do you thinke
13 2788 Of marching to Philippi presently
13 2789 
13 2790    Cassi. I do not thinke it good
13 2791 
13 2792    Bru. Your reason?
13 2793   Cassi. This it is:
13 2794 'Tis better that the Enemie seeke vs,
13 2795 So shall he waste his meanes, weary his Souldiers,
13 2796 Doing himselfe offence, whil'st we lying still,
13 2797 Are full of rest, defence, and nimblenesse
13 2798 
13 2799    Bru. Good reasons must of force giue place to better:
13 2800 The people 'twixt Philippi, and this ground
13 2801 Do stand but in a forc'd affection:
13 2802 For they haue grug'd vs Contribution.
13 2803 The Enemy, marching along by them,
13 2804 By them shall make a fuller number vp,
13 2805 Come on refresht, new added, and encourag'd:
13 2806 From which aduantage shall we cut him off.
13 2807 If at Philippi we do face him there,
13 2808 These people at our backe
13 2809 
13 2810    Cassi. Heare me good Brother
13 2811 
13 2812    Bru. Vnder your pardon. You must note beside,
13 2813 That we haue tride the vtmost of our Friends:
13 2814 Our Legions are brim full, our cause is ripe,
13 2815 The Enemy encreaseth euery day,
13 2816 We at the height, are readie to decline.
13 2817 There is a Tide in the affayres of men,
13 2818 Which taken at the Flood, leades on to Fortune:
13 2819 Omitted, all the voyage of their life,
13 2820 Is bound in Shallowes, and in Miseries.
13 2821 On such a full Sea are we now a-float,
13 2822 And we must take the current when it serues,
13 2823 Or loose our Ventures
13 2824 
13 2825    Cassi. Then with your will go on: wee'l along
13 2826 Our selues, and meet them at Philippi
13 2827 
13 2828    Bru. The deepe of night is crept vpon our talke,
13 2829 And Nature must obey Necessitie,
13 2830 Which we will niggard with a little rest:
13 2831 There is no more to say
13 2832 
13 2833    Cassi. No more, good night,
13 2834 Early to morrow will we rise, and hence.
13 2835 Enter Lucius.
13 2836 
13 2837   Bru. Lucius my Gowne: farewell good Messala,
13 2838 Good night Titinius: Noble, Noble Cassius,
13 2839 Good night, and good repose
13 2840 
13 2841    Cassi. O my deere Brother:
13 2842 This was an ill beginning of the night:
13 2843 Neuer come such diuision 'tweene our soules:
13 2844 Let it not Brutus.
13 2845 Enter Lucius with the Gowne.
13 2846 
13 2847   Bru. Euery thing is well
13 2848 
13 2849    Cassi. Good night my Lord
13 2850 
13 2851    Bru. Good night good Brother
13 2852 
13 2853    Tit. Messa. Good night Lord Brutus
13 2854 
13 2855    Bru. Farwell euery one.
13 2856 
13 2857 Exeunt.
13 2858 
13 2859 Giue me the Gowne. Where is thy Instrument?
13 2860   Luc. Heere in the Tent
13 2861 
13 2862    Bru. What, thou speak'st drowsily?
13 2863 Poore knaue I blame thee not, thou art ore-watch'd.
13 2864 Call Claudio, and some other of my men,
13 2865 Ile haue them sleepe on Cushions in my Tent
13 2866 
13 2867    Luc. Varrus, and Claudio.
13 2868 Enter Varrus and Claudio.
13 2869 
13 2870   Var. Cals my Lord?
13 2871   Bru. I pray you sirs, lye in my Tent and sleepe,
13 2872 It may be I shall raise you by and by
13 2873 On businesse to my Brother Cassius
13 2874 
13 2875    Var. So please you, we will stand,
13 2876 And watch your pleasure
13 2877 
13 2878    Bru. I will it not haue it so: Lye downe good sirs,
13 2879 It may be I shall otherwise bethinke me.
13 2880 Looke Lucius, heere's the booke I sought for so:
13 2881 I put it in the pocket of my Gowne
13 2882 
13 2883    Luc. I was sure your Lordship did not giue it me
13 2884 
13 2885    Bru. Beare with me good Boy, I am much forgetfull.
13 2886 Canst thou hold vp thy heauie eyes a-while,
13 2887 And touch thy Instrument a straine or two
13 2888 
13 2889    Luc. I my Lord, an't please you
13 2890 
13 2891    Bru. It does my Boy:
13 2892 I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing
13 2893 
13 2894    Luc. It is my duty Sir
13 2895 
13 2896    Brut. I should not vrge thy duty past thy might,
13 2897 I know yong bloods looke for a time of rest
13 2898 
13 2899    Luc. I haue slept my Lord already
13 2900 
13 2901    Bru. It was well done, and thou shalt sleepe againe:
13 2902 I will not hold thee long. If I do liue,
13 2903 I will be good to thee.
13 2904 
13 2905 Musicke, and a Song.
13 2906 
13 2907 This is a sleepy Tune: O Murd'rous slumber!
13 2908 Layest thou thy Leaden Mace vpon my Boy,
13 2909 That playes thee Musicke? Gentle knaue good night:
13 2910 I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee:
13 2911 If thou do'st nod, thou break'st thy Instrument,
13 2912 Ile take it from thee, and (good Boy) good night.
13 2913 Let me see, let me see; is not the Leafe turn'd downe
13 2914 Where I left reading? Heere it is I thinke.
13 2915 Enter the Ghost of Caesar.
13 2916 
13 2917 How ill this Taper burnes. Ha! Who comes heere?
13 2918 I thinke it is the weakenesse of mine eyes
13 2919 That shapes this monstrous Apparition.
13 2920 It comes vpon me: Art thou any thing?
13 2921 Art thou some God, some Angell, or some Diuell,
13 2922 That mak'st my blood cold, and my haire to stare?
13 2923 Speake to me, what thou art
13 2924 
13 2925    Ghost. Thy euill Spirit Brutus?
13 2926   Bru. Why com'st thou?
13 2927   Ghost. To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi
13 2928 
13 2929    Brut. Well: then I shall see thee againe?
13 2930   Ghost. I, at Philippi
13 2931 
13 2932    Brut. Why I will see thee at Philippi then:
13 2933 Now I haue taken heart, thou vanishest.
13 2934 Ill Spirit, I would hold more talke with thee.
13 2935 Boy, Lucius, Varrus, Claudio, Sirs: Awake:
13 2936 Claudio
13 2937 
13 2938    Luc. The strings my Lord, are false
13 2939 
13 2940    Bru. He thinkes he still is at his Instrument.
13 2941 Lucius, awake
13 2942 
13 2943    Luc. My Lord
13 2944 
13 2945    Bru. Did'st thou dreame Lucius, that thou so cryedst
13 2946 out?
13 2947   Luc. My Lord, I do not know that I did cry
13 2948 
13 2949    Bru. Yes that thou did'st: Did'st thou see any thing?
13 2950   Luc. Nothing my Lord
13 2951 
13 2952    Bru. Sleepe againe Lucius: Sirra Claudio, Fellow,
13 2953 Thou: Awake
13 2954 
13 2955    Var. My Lord
13 2956 
13 2957    Clau. My Lord
13 2958 
13 2959    Bru. Why did you so cry out sirs, in your sleepe?
13 2960   Both. Did we my Lord?
13 2961   Bru. I: saw you any thing?
13 2962   Var. No my Lord, I saw nothing
13 2963 
13 2964    Clau. Nor I my Lord
13 2965 
13 2966    Bru. Go, and commend me to my Brother Cassius:
13 2967 Bid him set on his Powres betimes before,
13 2968 And we will follow
13 2969 
13 2970    Both. It shall be done my Lord.
13 2971 
13 2972 Exeunt.
13 2973 
13 2974 Actus Quintus.
13 2975 
13 2976 Enter Octauius, Antony, and their Army.
13 2977 
13 2978   Octa. Now Antony, our hopes are answered,
13 2979 You said the Enemy would not come downe,
13 2980 But keepe the Hilles and vpper Regions:
13 2981 It proues not so: their battailes are at hand,
13 2982 They meane to warne vs at Philippi heere:
13 2983 Answering before we do demand of them
13 2984 
13 2985    Ant. Tut I am in their bosomes, and I know
13 2986 Wherefore they do it: They could be content
13 2987 To visit other places, and come downe
13 2988 With fearefull brauery: thinking by this face
13 2989 To fasten in our thoughts that they haue Courage;
13 2990 But 'tis not so.
13 2991 Enter a Messenger.
13 2992 
13 2993   Mes. Prepare you Generals,
13 2994 The Enemy comes on in gallant shew:
13 2995 Their bloody signe of Battell is hung out,
13 2996 And something to be done immediately
13 2997 
13 2998    Ant. Octauius, leade your Battaile softly on
13 2999 Vpon the left hand of the euen Field
13 3000 
13 3001    Octa. Vpon the right hand I, keepe thou the left
13 3002 
13 3003    Ant. Why do you crosse me in this exigent
13 3004 
13 3005    Octa. I do not crosse you: but I will do so.
13 3006 
13 3007 March.
13 3008 
13 3009 Drum. Enter Brutus, Cassius, & their Army.
13 3010 
13 3011   Bru. They stand, and would haue parley
13 3012 
13 3013    Cassi. Stand fast Titinius, we must out and talke
13 3014 
13 3015    Octa. Mark Antony, shall we giue signe of Battaile?
13 3016   Ant. No Caesar, we will answer on their Charge.
13 3017 Make forth, the Generals would haue some words
13 3018 
13 3019    Oct. Stirre not vntill the Signall
13 3020 
13 3021    Bru. Words before blowes: is it so Countrymen?
13 3022   Octa. Not that we loue words better, as you do
13 3023 
13 3024    Bru. Good words are better then bad strokes Octauius
13 3025 
13 3026    An. In your bad strokes Brutus, you giue good words
13 3027 Witnesse the hole you made in Caesars heart,
13 3028 Crying long liue, Haile Caesar
13 3029 
13 3030    Cassi. Antony,
13 3031 The posture of your blowes are yet vnknowne;
13 3032 But for your words, they rob the Hibla Bees,
13 3033 And leaue them Hony-lesse
13 3034 
13 3035    Ant. Not stinglesse too
13 3036 
13 3037    Bru. O yes, and soundlesse too:
13 3038 For you haue stolne their buzzing Antony,
13 3039 And very wisely threat before you sting
13 3040 
13 3041    Ant. Villains: you did not so, when your vile daggers
13 3042 Hackt one another in the sides of Caesar:
13 3043 You shew'd your teethes like Apes,
13 3044 And fawn'd like Hounds,
13 3045 And bow'd like Bondmen, kissing Caesars feete;
13 3046 Whil'st damned Caska, like a Curre, behinde
13 3047 Strooke Caesar on the necke. O you Flatterers
13 3048 
13 3049    Cassi. Flatterers? Now Brutus thanke your selfe,
13 3050 This tongue had not offended so to day.
13 3051 If Cassius might haue rul'd
13 3052 
13 3053    Octa. Come, come, the cause. If arguing make vs swet,
13 3054 The proofe of it will turne to redder drops:
13 3055 Looke, I draw a Sword against Conspirators,
13 3056 When thinke you that the Sword goes vp againe?
13 3057 Neuer till Caesars three and thirtie wounds
13 3058 Be well aueng'd; or till another Caesar
13 3059 Haue added slaughter to the Sword of Traitors
13 3060 
13 3061    Brut. Caesar, thou canst not dye by Traitors hands.
13 3062 Vnlesse thou bring'st them with thee
13 3063 
13 3064    Octa. So I hope:
13 3065 I was not borne to dye on Brutus Sword
13 3066 
13 3067    Bru. O if thou wer't the Noblest of thy Straine,
13 3068 Yong-man, thou could'st not dye more honourable
13 3069 
13 3070    Cassi. A peeuish School-boy, worthles of such Honor
13 3071 Ioyn'd with a Masker, and a Reueller
13 3072 
13 3073    Ant. Old Cassius still
13 3074 
13 3075    Octa. Come Antony: away:
13 3076 Defiance Traitors, hurle we in your teeth.
13 3077 If you dare fight to day, come to the Field;
13 3078 If not, when you haue stomackes.
13 3079 
13 3080 Exit Octauius, Antony, and Army
13 3081 
13 3082   Cassi. Why now blow winde, swell Billow,
13 3083 And swimme Barke:
13 3084 The Storme is vp, and all is on the hazard
13 3085 
13 3086    Bru. Ho Lucillius, hearke, a word with you.
13 3087 
13 3088 Lucillius and Messala stand forth.
13 3089 
13 3090   Luc. My Lord
13 3091 
13 3092    Cassi. Messala
13 3093 
13 3094    Messa. What sayes my Generall?
13 3095   Cassi. Messala, this is my Birth-day: at this very day
13 3096 Was Cassius borne. Giue me thy hand Messala:
13 3097 Be thou my witnesse, that against my will
13 3098 (As Pompey was) am I compell'd to set
13 3099 Vpon one Battell all our Liberties.
13 3100 You know, that I held Epicurus strong,
13 3101 And his Opinion: Now I change my minde,
13 3102 And partly credit things that do presage.
13 3103 Comming from Sardis, on our former Ensigne
13 3104 Two mighty Eagles fell, and there they pearch'd,
13 3105 Gorging and feeding from our Soldiers hands,
13 3106 Who to Philippi heere consorted vs:
13 3107 This Morning are they fled away, and gone,
13 3108 And in their steeds, do Rauens, Crowes, and Kites
13 3109 Fly ore our heads, and downward looke on vs
13 3110 As we were sickely prey; their shadowes seeme
13 3111 A Canopy most fatall, vnder which
13 3112 Our Army lies, ready to giue vp the Ghost
13 3113 
13 3114    Messa. Beleeue not so
13 3115 
13 3116    Cassi. I but beleeue it partly,
13 3117 For I am fresh of spirit, and resolu'd
13 3118 To meete all perils, very constantly
13 3119 
13 3120    Bru. Euen so Lucillius
13 3121 
13 3122    Cassi. Now most Noble Brutus,
13 3123 The Gods to day stand friendly, that we may
13 3124 Louers in peace, leade on our dayes to age.
13 3125 But since the affayres of men rests still incertaine,
13 3126 Let's reason with the worst that may befall.
13 3127 If we do lose this Battaile, then is this
13 3128 The very last time we shall speake together:
13 3129 What are you then determined to do?
13 3130   Bru. Euen by the rule of that Philosophy,
13 3131 By which I did blame Cato, for the death
13 3132 Which he did giue himselfe, I know not how:
13 3133 But I do finde it Cowardly, and vile,
13 3134 For feare of what might fall, so to preuent
13 3135 The time of life, arming my selfe with patience,
13 3136 To stay the prouidence of some high Powers,
13 3137 That gouerne vs below
13 3138 
13 3139    Cassi. Then, if we loose this Battaile,
13 3140 You are contented to be led in Triumph
13 3141 Thorow the streets of Rome
13 3142 
13 3143    Bru. No Cassius, no:
13 3144 Thinke not thou Noble Romane,
13 3145 That euer Brutus will go bound to Rome,
13 3146 He beares too great a minde. But this same day
13 3147 Must end that worke, the Ides of March begun.
13 3148 And whether we shall meete againe, I know not:
13 3149 Therefore our euerlasting farewell take:
13 3150 For euer, and for euer, farewell Cassius,
13 3151 If we do meete againe, why we shall smile;
13 3152 If not, why then this parting was well made
13 3153 
13 3154    Cassi. For euer, and for euer, farewell Brutus:
13 3155 If we do meete againe, wee'l smile indeede;
13 3156 If not, 'tis true, this parting was well made
13 3157 
13 3158    Bru. Why then leade on. O that a man might know
13 3159 The end of this dayes businesse, ere it come:
13 3160 But it sufficeth, that the day will end,
13 3161 And then the end is knowne. Come ho, away.
13 3162 
13 3163 Exeunt.
13 3164 
13 3165 Alarum. Enter Brutus and Messala.
13 3166 
13 3167   Bru. Ride, ride Messala, ride and giue these Billes
13 3168 Vnto the Legions, on the other side.
13 3169 
13 3170 Lowd Alarum.
13 3171 
13 3172 Let them set on at once: for I perceiue
13 3173 But cold demeanor in Octauio's wing:
13 3174 And sodaine push giues them the ouerthrow:
13 3175 Ride, ride Messala, let them all come downe.
13 3176 
13 3177 Exeunt.
13 3178 
13 3179 Alarums. Enter Cassius and Titinius.
13 3180 
13 3181   Cassi. O looke Titinius, looke, the Villaines flye:
13 3182 My selfe haue to mine owne turn'd Enemy:
13 3183 This Ensigne heere of mine was turning backe,
13 3184 I slew the Coward, and did take it from him
13 3185 
13 3186    Titin. O Cassius, Brutus gaue the word too early,
13 3187 Who hauing some aduantage on Octauius,
13 3188 Tooke it too eagerly: his Soldiers fell to spoyle,
13 3189 Whilst we by Antony are all inclos'd.
13 3190 Enter Pindarus.
13 3191 
13 3192   Pind. Fly further off my Lord: flye further off,
13 3193 Mark Antony is in your Tents my Lord:
13 3194 Flye therefore Noble Cassius, flye farre off
13 3195 
13 3196    Cassi. This Hill is farre enough. Looke, look Titinius
13 3197 Are those my Tents where I perceiue the fire?
13 3198   Tit. They are, my Lord
13 3199 
13 3200    Cassi. Titinius, if thou louest me,
13 3201 Mount thou my horse, and hide thy spurres in him,
13 3202 Till he haue brought thee vp to yonder Troopes
13 3203 And heere againe, that I may rest assur'd
13 3204 Whether yond Troopes, are Friend or Enemy
13 3205 
13 3206    Tit. I will be heere againe, euen with a thought.
13 3207 Enter.
13 3208 
13 3209   Cassi. Go Pindarus, get higher on that hill,
13 3210 My sight was euer thicke: regard Titinius,
13 3211 And tell me what thou not'st about the Field.
13 3212 This day I breathed first, Time is come round,
13 3213 And where I did begin, there shall I end,
13 3214 My life is run his compasse. Sirra, what newes?
13 3215   Pind. Aboue. O my Lord
13 3216 
13 3217    Cassi. What newes?
13 3218   Pind. Titinius is enclosed round about
13 3219 With Horsemen, that make to him on the Spurre,
13 3220 Yet he spurres on. Now they are almost on him:
13 3221 Now Titinius. Now some light: O he lights too.
13 3222 Hee's tane.
13 3223 
13 3224 Showt.
13 3225 
13 3226 And hearke, they shout for ioy
13 3227 
13 3228    Cassi. Come downe, behold no more:
13 3229 O Coward that I am, to liue so long,
13 3230 To see my best Friend tane before my face
13 3231 Enter Pindarus.
13 3232 
13 3233 Come hither sirrah: In Parthia did I take thee Prisoner,
13 3234 And then I swore thee, sauing of thy life,
13 3235 That whatsoeuer I did bid thee do,
13 3236 Thou should'st attempt it. Come now, keepe thine oath,
13 3237 Now be a Free-man, and with this good Sword
13 3238 That ran through Caesars bowels, search this bosome.
13 3239 Stand not to answer: Heere, take thou the Hilts,
13 3240 And when my face is couer'd, as 'tis now,
13 3241 Guide thou the Sword- Caesar, thou art reueng'd,
13 3242 Euen with the Sword that kill'd thee
13 3243 
13 3244    Pin. So, I am free,
13 3245 Yet would not so haue beene
13 3246 Durst I haue done my will. O Cassius,
13 3247 Farre from this Country Pindarus shall run,
13 3248 Where neuer Roman shall take note of him.
13 3249 Enter Titinius and Messala.
13 3250 
13 3251   Messa. It is but change, Titinius: for Octauius
13 3252 Is ouerthrowne by Noble Brutus power,
13 3253 As Cassius Legions are by Antony
13 3254 
13 3255    Titin. These tydings will well comfort Cassius
13 3256 
13 3257    Messa. Where did you leaue him
13 3258 
13 3259    Titin. All disconsolate,
13 3260 With Pindarus his Bondman, on this Hill
13 3261 
13 3262    Messa. Is not that he that lyes vpon the ground?
13 3263   Titin. He lies not like the Liuing. O my heart!
13 3264   Messa. Is not that hee?
13 3265   Titin. No, this was he Messala,
13 3266 But Cassius is no more. O setting Sunne:
13 3267 As in thy red Rayes thou doest sinke to night;
13 3268 So in his red blood Cassius day is set.
13 3269 The Sunne of Rome is set. Our day is gone,
13 3270 Clowds, Dewes, and Dangers come; our deeds are done:
13 3271 Mistrust of my successe hath done this deed
13 3272 
13 3273    Messa. Mistrust of good successe hath done this deed.
13 3274 O hatefull Error, Melancholies Childe:
13 3275 Why do'st thou shew to the apt thoughts of men
13 3276 The things that are not? O Error soone conceyu'd,
13 3277 Thou neuer com'st vnto a happy byrth,
13 3278 But kil'st the Mother that engendred thee
13 3279 
13 3280    Tit. What Pindarus? Where art thou Pindarus?
13 3281   Messa. Seeke him Titinius, whilst I go to meet
13 3282 The Noble Brutus, thrusting this report
13 3283 Into his eares; I may say thrusting it:
13 3284 For piercing Steele, and Darts inuenomed,
13 3285 Shall be as welcome to the eares of Brutus,
13 3286 As tydings of this sight
13 3287 
13 3288    Tit. Hye you Messala,
13 3289 And I will seeke for Pindarus the while:
13 3290 Why did'st thou send me forth braue Cassius?
13 3291 Did I not meet thy Friends, and did not they
13 3292 Put on my Browes this wreath of Victorie,
13 3293 And bid me giue it thee? Did'st thou not heare their showts?
13 3294 Alas, thou hast misconstrued euery thing.
13 3295 But hold thee, take this Garland on thy Brow,
13 3296 Thy Brutus bid me giue it thee, and I
13 3297 Will do his bidding. Brutus, come apace,
13 3298 And see how I regarded Caius Cassius:
13 3299 By your leaue Gods: This is a Romans part,
13 3300 Come Cassius Sword, and finde Titinius hart.
13 3301 
13 3302 Dies
13 3303 
13 3304 Alarum. Enter Brutus, Messala, yong Cato, Strato, Volumnius, and
13 3305 Lucillius.
13 3306 
13 3307   Bru. Where, where Messala, doth his body lye?
13 3308   Messa. Loe yonder, and Titinius mourning it
13 3309 
13 3310    Bru. Titinius face is vpward
13 3311 
13 3312    Cato. He is slaine
13 3313 
13 3314    Bru. O Iulius Caesar, thou art mighty yet,
13 3315 Thy Spirit walkes abroad, and turnes our Swords
13 3316 In our owne proper Entrailes. Low Alarums
13 3317 
13 3318    Cato. Braue Titinius,
13 3319 Looke where he haue not crown'd dead Cassius
13 3320 
13 3321    Bru. Are yet two Romans liuing such as these?
13 3322 The last of all the Romans, far thee well:
13 3323 It is impossible, that euer Rome
13 3324 Should breed thy fellow. Friends I owe mo teares
13 3325 To this dead man, then you shall see me pay.
13 3326 I shall finde time, Cassius: I shall finde time.
13 3327 Come therefore, and to Tharsus send his body,
13 3328 His Funerals shall not be in our Campe,
13 3329 Least it discomfort vs. Lucillius come,
13 3330 And come yong Cato, let vs to the Field,
13 3331 Labio and Flauio set our Battailes on:
13 3332 'Tis three a clocke, and Romans yet ere night,
13 3333 We shall try Fortune in a second fight.
13 3334 
13 3335 Exeunt.
13 3336 
13 3337 Alarum. Enter Brutus, Messala, Cato, Lucillius, and Flauius.
13 3338 
13 3339   Bru. Yet Country-men: O yet, hold vp your heads
13 3340 
13 3341    Cato. What Bastard doth not? Who will go with me?
13 3342 I will proclaime my name about the Field.
13 3343 I am the Sonne of Marcus Cato, hoe.
13 3344 A Foe to Tyrants, and my Countries Friend.
13 3345 I am the Sonne of Marcus Cato, hoe.
13 3346 Enter Souldiers, and fight.
13 3347 
13 3348 And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I,
13 3349 Brutus my Countries Friend: Know me for Brutus
13 3350 
13 3351    Luc. O yong and Noble Cato, art thou downe?
13 3352 Why now thou dyest, as brauely as Titinius,
13 3353 And may'st be honour'd, being Cato's Sonne
13 3354 
13 3355    Sold. Yeeld, or thou dyest
13 3356 
13 3357    Luc. Onely I yeeld to dye:
13 3358 There is so much, that thou wilt kill me straight:
13 3359 Kill Brutus, and be honour'd in his death
13 3360 
13 3361    Sold. We must not: a Noble Prisoner.
13 3362 Enter Antony.
13 3363 
13 3364   2.Sold. Roome hoe: tell Antony, Brutus is tane
13 3365 
13 3366    1.Sold. Ile tell thee newes. Heere comes the Generall,
13 3367 Brutus is tane, Brutus is tane my Lord
13 3368 
13 3369    Ant. Where is hee?
13 3370   Luc. Safe Antony, Brutus is safe enough:
13 3371 I dare assure thee, that no Enemy
13 3372 Shall euer take aliue the Noble Brutus:
13 3373 The Gods defend him from so great a shame,
13 3374 When you do finde him, or aliue, or dead,
13 3375 He will be found like Brutus, like himselfe
13 3376 
13 3377    Ant. This is not Brutus friend, but I assure you,
13 3378 A prize no lesse in worth; keepe this man safe,
13 3379 Giue him all kindnesse. I had rather haue
13 3380 Such men my Friends, then Enemies. Go on,
13 3381 And see where Brutus be aliue or dead,
13 3382 And bring vs word, vnto Octauius Tent:
13 3383 How euery thing is chanc'd.
13 3384 
13 3385 Exeunt.
13 3386 
13 3387 Enter Brutus, Dardanius, Clitus, Strato, and Volumnius.
13 3388 
13 3389   Brut. Come poore remaines of friends, rest on this
13 3390 Rocke
13 3391 
13 3392    Clit. Statillius shew'd the Torch-light, but my Lord
13 3393 He came not backe: he is or tane, or slaine
13 3394 
13 3395    Brut. Sit thee downe, Clitus: slaying is the word,
13 3396 It is a deed in fashion. Hearke thee, Clitus
13 3397 
13 3398    Clit. What I, my Lord? No, not for all the World
13 3399 
13 3400    Brut. Peace then, no words
13 3401 
13 3402    Clit. Ile rather kill my selfe
13 3403 
13 3404    Brut. Hearke thee, Dardanius
13 3405 
13 3406    Dard. Shall I doe such a deed?
13 3407   Clit. O Dardanius
13 3408 
13 3409    Dard. O Clitus
13 3410 
13 3411    Clit. What ill request did Brutus make to thee?
13 3412   Dard. To kill him, Clitus: looke he meditates
13 3413 
13 3414    Clit. Now is that Noble Vessell full of griefe,
13 3415 That it runnes ouer euen at his eyes
13 3416 
13 3417    Brut. Come hither, good Volumnius, list a word
13 3418 
13 3419    Volum. What sayes my Lord?
13 3420   Brut. Why this, Volumnius:
13 3421 The Ghost of Caesar hath appear'd to me
13 3422 Two seuerall times by Night: at Sardis, once;
13 3423 And this last Night, here in Philippi fields:
13 3424 I know my houre is come
13 3425 
13 3426    Volum. Not so, my Lord
13 3427 
13 3428    Brut. Nay, I am sure it is, Volumnius.
13 3429 Thou seest the World, Volumnius, how it goes,
13 3430 Our Enemies haue beat vs to the Pit:
13 3431 
13 3432 Low Alarums.
13 3433 
13 3434 It is more worthy, to leape in our selues,
13 3435 Then tarry till they push vs. Good Volumnius,
13 3436 Thou know'st, that we two went to Schoole together:
13 3437 Euen for that our loue of old, I prethee
13 3438 Hold thou my Sword Hilts, whilest I runne on it
13 3439 
13 3440    Vol. That's not an Office for a friend, my Lord.
13 3441 
13 3442 Alarum still.
13 3443

13 3501 All the Conspirators saue onely hee,
13 3502 Did that they did, in enuy of great Caesar:
13 3503 He, onely in a generall honest thought,
13 3504 And common good to all, made one of them.
13 3505 His life was gentle, and the Elements
13 3506 So mixt in him, that Nature might stand vp,
13 3507 And say to all the world; This was a man
13 3508 
13 3509    Octa. According to his Vertue, let vs vse him

13 3512 Most like a Souldier ordered Honourably:
13 3513 So call the Field to rest, and let's away,
13 3514 To part the glories of this happy day.
