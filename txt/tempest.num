3 52 ACT I.
3 53 
3 54 
3 55 SCENE I. _On a ship at sea: a tempestuous noise of thunder
3 56 and lightning heard._
3 57 
3 58   _Enter _a Ship-Master_ and _a Boatswain_._
3 59 
3 60 _Mast._ Boatswain!
3 61 
3 62 _Boats._ Here, master: what cheer?
3 63 
3 64 _Mast._ Good, speak to the mariners: fall to’t, yarely, or
3 65 we run ourselves aground: bestir, bestir.    [_Exit._
3 66 
3 67   _Enter _Mariners_._
3 68 
3 69 _Boats._ Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts!              5
3 70 yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to the master’s
3 71 whistle. Blow, till thou burst thy wind, if room enough!
3 72 
3 73   _Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, FERDINAND, GONZALO,
3 74   and others._
3 75 
3 76 _Alon._ Good boatswain, have care. Where’s the master?
3 77 Play the men.
3 78 
3 79 _Boats._ I pray now, keep below.                                    10
3 80 
3 81 _Ant._ Where is the master, boatswain?
3 82 
3 83 _Boats._ Do you not hear him? You mar our labour:
3 84 keep your cabins: you do assist the storm.
3 85 
3 86 _Gon._ Nay, good, be patient.
3 87 
3 88 _Boats._ When the sea is. Hence! What cares these                   15
3 89 roarers for the name of king? To cabin: silence! trouble
3 90 us not.
3 91 
3 92 _Gon._ Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.
3 93 
3 94 _Boats._ None that I more love than myself. You are a
3 95 Counsellor; if you can command these elements to silence,           20
3 96 and work the peace of the present, we will not hand a rope
3 97 more; use your authority: if you cannot, give thanks you
3 98 have lived so long, and make yourself ready in your cabin
3 99 for the mischance of the hour, if it so hap. Cheerly, good
3 100 hearts! Out of our way, I say.    [_Exit._                          25
3 101 
3 102 _Gon._ I have great comfort from this fellow: methinks
3 103 he hath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion is
3 104 perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his hanging:
3 105 make the rope of his destiny our cable, for our own doth
3 106 little advantage. If he be not born to be hanged, our case          30
3 107 is miserable.    [_Exeunt._
3 108 
3 109   _Re-enter Boatswain._
3 110 
3 111 _Boats._ Down with the topmast! yare! lower, lower!
3 112 Bring her to try with main-course. [_A cry within._] A
3 113 plague upon this howling! they are louder than the weather
3 114 or our office.                                                      35
3 115 
3 116   _Re-enter SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, and GONZALO._
3 117 
3 118 Yet again! what do you here? Shall we give o’er, and
3 119 drown? Have you a mind to sink?
3 120 
3 121 _Seb._ A pox o’ your throat, you bawling, blasphemous,
3 122 incharitable dog!
3 123 
3 124 _Boats._ Work you, then.                                            40
3 125 
3 126 _Ant._ Hang, cur! hang, you whoreson, insolent noise-maker.
3 127 We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art.
3 128 
3 129 _Gon._ I’ll warrant him for drowning; though the ship
3 130 were no stronger than a nutshell, and as leaky as an unstanched
3 131 wench.                                                              45
3 132 
3 133 _Boats._ Lay her a-hold, a-hold! set her two courses off
3 134 to sea again; lay her off.
3 135 
3 136   _Enter _Mariners_ wet._
3 137 
3 138 _Mariners._ All lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost!
3 139 
3 140 _Boats._ What, must our mouths be cold?
3 141 
3 142 _Gon._ The king and prince at prayers! let’s assist them,           50
3 143 For our case is as theirs.
3 144 
3 145 _Seb._                   I’m out of patience.
3 146 
3 147 _Ant._ We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards:
3 148 This wide-chapp’d rascal,--would thou mightst lie drowning
3 149 The washing of ten tides!
3 150 
3 151 _Gon._                  He’ll be hang’d yet,
3 152 Though every drop of water swear against it,                        55
3 153 And gape at widest to glut him.
3 154 
3 155   [_A confused noise within:_ “Mercy on us!”--
3 156   “We split, we split!”-- “Farewell my wife and children!”--
3 157   “Farewell, brother!”-- “We split, we split, we split!”]
3 158 
3 159 _Ant._ Let’s all sink with the king.                                60
3 160 
3 161 _Seb._ Let’s take leave of him. [_Exeunt Ant. and Seb._
3 162 
3 163 _Gon._ Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for
3 164 an acre of barren ground, long heath, brown furze, any
3 165 thing. The wills above be done! but I would fain die a
3 166 dry death.    [_Exeunt._                                            65

3 203 SCENE II. _The island. Before PROSPERO’S cell._
3 204 
3 205   _Enter PROSPERO and MIRANDA._
3 206 
3 207 _Mir._ If by your art, my dearest father, you have
3 208 Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.
3 209 The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,
3 210 But that the sea, mounting to the welkin’s cheek,
3 211 Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffer’d                              5
3 212 With those that I saw suffer! a brave vessel,
3 213 Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,
3 214 Dash’d all to pieces. O, the cry did knock
3 215 Against my very heart! Poor souls, they perish’d!
3 216 Had I been any god of power, I would                                10
3 217 Have sunk the sea within the earth, or ere
3 218 It should the good ship so have swallow’d and
3 219 The fraughting souls within her.
3 220 
3 221 _Pros._                        Be collected:
3 222 No more amazement: tell your piteous heart
3 223 There’s no harm done.
3 224 
3 225 _Mir._              O, woe the day!
3 226 
3 227 _Pros._                           No harm.                          15
3 228 I have done nothing but in care of thee,
3 229 Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who
3 230 Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing
3 231 Of whence I am, nor that I am more better
3 232 Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell,                          20
3 233 And thy no greater father.
3 234 
3 235 _Mir._                   More to know
3 236 Did never meddle with my thoughts.
3 237 
3 238 _Pros._                          ’Tis time
3 239 I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,
3 240 And pluck my magic garment from me. --So:
3 241                                 [_Lays down his mantle._
3 242 Lie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.              25
3 243 The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch’d
3 244 The very virtue of compassion in thee,
3 245 I have with such provision in mine art
3 246 So safely order’d, that there is no soul,
3 247 No, not so much perdition as an hair                                30
3 248 Betid to any creature in the vessel
3 249 Which thou heard’st cry, which thou saw’st sink. Sit down;
3 250 For thou must now know farther.
3 251 
3 252 _Mir._                        You have often
3 253 Begun to tell me what I am; but stopp’d,
3 254 And left me to a bootless inquisition,                              35
3 255 Concluding “Stay: not yet.”
3 256 
3 257 _Pros._                The hour’s now come;
3 258 The very minute bids thee ope thine ear;
3 259 Obey, and be attentive. Canst thou remember
3 260 A time before we came unto this cell?
3 261 I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not                   40
3 262 Out three years old.
3 263 
3 264 _Mir._             Certainly, sir, I can.
3 265 
3 266 _Pros._ By what? by any other house or person?
3 267 Of any thing the image tell me that
3 268 Hath kept with thy remembrance.
3 269 
3 270 _Mir._                        ’Tis far off,
3 271 And rather like a dream than an assurance                           45
3 272 That my remembrance warrants. Had I not
3 273 Four or five women once that tended me?
3 274 
3 275 _Pros._ Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it
3 276 That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else
3 277 In the dark backward and abysm of time?                             50
3 278 If thou remember’st ought ere thou camest here,
3 279 How thou camest here thou mayst.
3 280 
3 281 _Mir._                         But that I do not.
3 282 
3 283 _Pros._ Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,
3 284 Thy father was the Duke of Milan, and
3 285 A prince of power.
3 286 
3 287 _Mir._           Sir, are not you my father?                        55
3 288 
3 289 _Pros._ Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and
3 290 She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father
3 291 Was Duke of Milan; and his only heir
3 292 And princess, no worse issued.
3 293 
3 294 _Mir._                       O the heavens!
3 295 What foul play had we, that we came from thence?                    60
3 296 Or blessed was’t we did?
3 297 
3 298 _Pros._                Both, both, my girl:
3 299 By foul play, as thou say’st, were we heaved thence;
3 300 But blessedly holp hither.
3 301 
3 302 _Mir._                   O, my heart bleeds
3 303 To think o’ the teen that I have turn’d you to.
3 304 Which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther.                  65
3 305 
3 306 _Pros._ My brother, and thy uncle, call’d Antonio,--
3 307 I pray thee, mark me,--that a brother should
3 308 Be so perfidious!--he whom, next thyself,
3 309 Of all the world I loved, and to him put
3 310 The manage of my state; as, at that time,                           70
3 311 Through all the signories it was the first,
3 312 And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed
3 313 In dignity, and for the liberal arts
3 314 Without a parallel; those being all my study,
3 315 The government I cast upon my brother,                              75
3 316 And to my state grew stranger, being transported
3 317 And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle--
3 318 Dost thou attend me?
3 319 
3 320 _Mir._             Sir, most heedfully.
3 321 
3 322 _Pros._ Being once perfected how to grant suits,
3 323 How to deny them, whom to advance, and whom                         80
3 324 To trash for over-topping, new created
3 325 The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed ’em,
3 326 Or else new form’d ’em; having both the key
3 327 Of officer and office, set all hearts i’ the state
3 328 To what tune pleased his ear; that now he was                       85
3 329 The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,
3 330 And suck’d my verdure out on’t. Thou attend’st not.
3 331 
3 332 _Mir._ O, good sir, I do.
3 333 
3 334 _Pros._                 I pray thee, mark me.
3 335 I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated
3 336 To closeness and the bettering of my mind                           90
3 337 With that which, but by being so retired,
3 338 O’er-prized all popular rate, in my false brother
3 339 Awaked an evil nature; and my trust,
3 340 Like a good parent, did beget of him
3 341 A falsehood in its contrary, as great                               95
3 342 As my trust was; which had indeed no limit,
3 343 A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,
3 344 Not only with what my revenue yielded,
3 345 But what my power might else exact, like one
3 346 Who having into truth, by telling of it,                           100
3 347 Made such a sinner of his memory,
3 348 To credit his own lie, he did believe
3 349 He was indeed the duke; out o’ the substitution,
3 350 And executing the outward face of royalty,
3 351 With all prerogative:--hence his ambition growing,--               105
3 352 Dost thou hear?
3 353 
3 354 _Mir._        Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.
3 355 
3 356 _Pros._ To have no screen between this part he play’d
3 357 And him he play’d it for, he needs will be
3 358 Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library
3 359 Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties                    110
3 360 He thinks me now incapable; confederates,
3 361 So dry he was for sway, wi’ the King of Naples
3 362 To give him annual tribute, do him homage,
3 363 Subject his coronet to his crown, and bend
3 364 The dukedom, yet unbow’d,--alas, poor Milan!--                     115
3 365 To most ignoble stooping.
3 366 
3 367 _Mir._                  O the heavens!
3 368 
3 369 _Pros._ Mark his condition, and th’ event; then tell me
3 370 If this might be a brother.
3 371 
3 372 _Mir._                    I should sin
3 373 To think but nobly of my grandmother:
3 374 Good wombs have borne bad sons.
3 375 
3 376 _Pros._                       Now the condition.                   120
3 377 This King of Naples, being an enemy
3 378 To me inveterate, hearkens my brother’s suit;
3 379 Which was, that he, in lieu o’ the premises,
3 380 Of homage and I know not how much tribute,
3 381 Should presently extirpate me and mine                             125
3 382 Out of the dukedom, and confer fair Milan,
3 383 With all the honours, on my brother: whereon,
3 384 A treacherous army levied, one midnight
3 385 Fated to the purpose, did Antonio open
3 386 The gates of Milan; and, i’ the dead of darkness,                  130
3 387 The ministers for the purpose hurried thence
3 388 Me and thy crying self.
3 389 
3 390 _Mir._                Alack, for pity!
3 391 I, not remembering how I cried out then,
3 392 Will cry it o’er again: it is a hint
3 393 That wrings mine eyes to’t.
3 394 
3 395 _Pros._                   Hear a little further,                   135
3 396 And then I’ll bring thee to the present business
3 397 Which now’s upon ’s; without the which, this story
3 398 Were most impertinent.
3 399 
3 400 _Mir._               Wherefore did they not
3 401 That hour destroy us?
3 402 
3 403 _Pros._             Well demanded, wench:
3 404 My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,              140
3 405 So dear the love my people bore me; nor set
3 406 A mark so bloody on the business; but
3 407 With colours fairer painted their foul ends.
3 408 In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,
3 409 Bore us some leagues to sea; where they prepared                   145
3 410 A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg’d,
3 411 Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats
3 412 Instinctively have quit it: there they hoist us,
3 413 To cry to the sea that roar’d to us; to sigh
3 414 To the winds, whose pity, sighing back again,                      150
3 415 Did us but loving wrong.
3 416 
3 417 _Mir._                 Alack, what trouble
3 418 Was I then to you!
3 419 
3 420 _Pros._          O, a cherubin
3 421 Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile,
3 422 Infused with a fortitude from heaven,
3 423 When I have deck’d the sea with drops full salt,                   155
3 424 Under my burthen groan’d; which raised in me
3 425 An undergoing stomach, to bear up
3 426 Against what should ensue.
3 427 
3 428 _Mir._                   How came we ashore?
3 429 
3 430 _Pros._ By Providence divine.
3 431 Some food we had, and some fresh water, that                       160
3 432 A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,
3 433 Out of his charity, who being then appointed
3 434 Master of this design, did give us, with
3 435 Rich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries,
3 436 Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness,              165
3 437 Knowing I loved my books, he furnish’d me
3 438 From mine own library with volumes that
3 439 I prize above my dukedom.
3 440 
3 441 _Mir._                  Would I might
3 442 But ever see that man!
3 443 
3 444 _Pros._              Now I arise:  [_Resumes his mantle._
3 445 Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.                    170
3 446 Here in this island we arrived; and here
3 447 Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit
3 448 Than other princesses can, that have more time
3 449 For vainer hours, and tutors not so careful.
3 450 
3 451 _Mir._ Heavens thank you for’t! And now, I pray you, sir,          175
3 452 For still ’tis beating in my mind, your reason
3 453 For raising this sea-storm?
3 454 
3 455 _Pros._                   Know thus far forth.
3 456 By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune,
3 457 Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies
3 458 Brought to this shore; and by my prescience                        180
3 459 I find my zenith doth depend upon
3 460 A most auspicious star, whose influence
3 461 If now I court not, but omit, my fortunes
3 462 Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions:
3 463 Thou art inclined to sleep; ’tis a good dulness,                   185
3 464 And give it way: I know thou canst not choose.
3 465                                         [_Miranda sleeps._
3 466 Come away, servant, come. I am ready now.
3 467 Approach, my Ariel, come.
3 468 
3 469   _Enter _ARIEL_._
3 470 
3 471 _Ari._ All hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come
3 472 To answer thy best pleasure; be’t to fly,                          190
3 473 To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride
3 474 On the curl’d clouds, to thy strong bidding task
3 475 Ariel and all his quality.
3 476 
3 477 _Pros._                  Hast thou, spirit,
3 478 Perform’d to point the tempest that I bade thee?
3 479 
3 480 _Ari._ To every article.                                           195
3 481 I boarded the king’s ship; now on the beak,
3 482 Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,
3 483 I flamed amazement: sometime I’ld divide,
3 484 And burn in many places; on the topmast,
3 485 The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,                  200
3 486 Then meet and join. Jove’s lightnings, the precursors
3 487 O’ the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary
3 488 And sight-outrunning were not: the fire and cracks
3 489 Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune
3 490 Seem to besiege, and make his bold waves tremble,                  205
3 491 Yea, his dread trident shake.
3 492 
3 493 _Pros._                     My brave spirit!
3 494 Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil
3 495 Would not infect his reason?
3 496 
3 497 _Ari._                     Not a soul
3 498 But felt a fever of the mad, and play’d
3 499 Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners                       210
3 500 Plunged in the foaming brine, and quit the vessel,
3 501 Then all afire with me: the king’s son, Ferdinand,
3 502 With hair up-staring,--then like reeds, not hair,--
3 503 Was the first man that leap’d; cried, “Hell is empty,
3 504 And all the devils are here.”
3 505 
3 506 _Pros._                 Why, that’s my spirit!                     215
3 507 But was not this nigh shore?
3 508 
3 509 _Ari._                    Close by, my master.
3 510 
3 511 _Pros._ But are they, Ariel, safe?
3 512 
3 513 _Ari._                           Not a hair perish’d;
3 514 On their sustaining garments not a blemish,
3 515 But fresher than before: and, as thou badest me,
3 516 In troops I have dispersed them ’bout the isle.                    220
3 517 The king’s son have I landed by himself;
3 518 Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs
3 519 In an odd angle of the isle, and sitting,
3 520 His arms in this sad knot.
3 521 
3 522 _Pros._                  Of the king’s ship
3 523 The mariners, say how thou hast disposed,                          225
3 524 And all the rest o’ the fleet.
3 525 
3 526 _Ari._                       Safely in harbour
3 527 Is the king’s ship; in the deep nook, where once
3 528 Thou call’dst me up at midnight to fetch dew
3 529 From the still-vex’d Bermoothes, there she’s hid:
3 530 The mariners all under hatches stow’d;                             230
3 531 Who, with a charm join’d to their suffer’d labour,
3 532 I have left asleep: and for the rest o’ the fleet,
3 533 Which I dispersed, they all have met again,
3 534 And are upon the Mediterranean flote,
3 535 Bound sadly home for Naples;                                       235
3 536 Supposing that they saw the king’s ship wreck’d,
3 537 And his great person perish.
3 538 
3 539 _Pros._                    Ariel, thy charge
3 540 Exactly is perform’d: but there’s more work.
3 541 What is the time o’ the day?
3 542 
3 543 _Ari._                     Past the mid season.
3 544 
3 545 _Pros._ At least two glasses. The time ’twixt six and now          240
3 546 Must by us both be spent most preciously.
3 547 
3 548 _Ari._ Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,
3 549 Let me remember thee what thou hast promised,
3 550 Which is not yet perform’d me.
3 551 
3 552 _Pros._                      How now? moody?
3 553 What is’t thou canst demand?
3 554 
3 555 _Ari._                     My liberty.                             245
3 556 
3 557 _Pros._ Before the time be out? no more!
3 558 
3 559 _Ari._                                 I prithee,
3 560 Remember I have done thee worthy service;
3 561 Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, served
3 562 Without or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promise
3 563 To bate me a full year.
3 564 
3 565 _Pros._               Dost thou forget                             250
3 566 From what a torment I did free thee?
3 567 
3 568 _Ari._                             No.
3 569 
3 570 _Pros._ Thou dost; and think’st it much to tread the ooze
3 571 Of the salt deep,
3 572 To run upon the sharp wind of the north,
3 573 To do me business in the veins o’ the earth                        255
3 574 When it is baked with frost.
3 575 
3 576 _Ari._                     I do not, sir.
3 577 
3 578 _Pros._ Thou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgot
3 579 The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy
3 580 Was grown into a hoop? hast thou forgot her?
3 581 
3 582 _Ari._ No, sir.
3 583 
3 584 _Pros._       Thou hast. Where was she born? speak; tell me.       260
3 585 
3 586 _Ari._ Sir, in Argier.
3 587 
3 588 _Pros._              O, was she so? I must
3 589 Once in a month recount what thou hast been,
3 590 Which thou forget’st. This damn’d witch Sycorax,
3 591 For mischiefs manifold, and sorceries terrible
3 592 To enter human hearing, from Argier,                               265
3 593 Thou know’st, was banish’d: for one thing she did
3 594 They would not take her life. Is not this true?
3 595 
3 596 _Ari._ Ay, sir.
3 597 
3 598 _Pros._ This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child,
3 599 And here was left by the sailors. Thou, my slave,                  270
3 600 As thou report’st thyself, wast then her servant;
3 601 And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate
3 602 To act her earthy and abhorr’d commands,
3 603 Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,
3 604 By help of her more potent ministers,                              275
3 605 And in her most unmitigable rage,
3 606 Into a cloven pine; within which rift
3 607 Imprison’d thou didst painfully remain
3 608 A dozen years; within which space she died,
3 609 And left thee there; where thou didst vent thy groans              280
3 610 As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island--
3 611 Save for the son that she did litter here,
3 612 A freckled whelp hag-born--not honour’d with
3 613 A human shape.
3 614 
3 615 _Ari._       Yes, Caliban her son.
3 616 
3 617 _Pros._ Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban,                    285
3 618 Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know’st
3 619 What torment I did find thee in; thy groans
3 620 Did make wolves howl, and penetrate the breasts
3 621 Of ever-angry bears: it was a torment
3 622 To lay upon the damn’d, which Sycorax                              290
3 623 Could not again undo: it was mine art,
3 624 When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape
3 625 The pine, and let thee out.
3 626 
3 627 _Ari._                    I thank thee, master.
3 628 
3 629 _Pros._ If thou more murmur’st, I will rend an oak,
3 630 And peg thee in his knotty entrails, till                          295
3 631 Thou hast howl’d away twelve winters.
3 632 
3 633 _Ari._                              Pardon, master:
3 634 I will be correspondent to command,
3 635 And do my spiriting gently.
3 636 
3 637 _Pros._                   Do so; and after two days
3 638 I will discharge thee.
3 639 
3 640 _Ari._               That’s my noble master!
3 641 What shall I do? say what; what shall I do?                        300
3 642 
3 643 _Pros._ Go make thyself like a nymph o’ the sea:
3 644 Be subject to no sight but thine and mine; invisible
3 645 To every eyeball else. Go take this shape,
3 646 And hither come in’t: go, hence with diligence!
3 647 
3 648     [_Exit Ariel._
3 649 
3 650 Awake, dear heart, awake! thou hast slept well;                    305
3 651 Awake!
3 652 
3 653 _Mir._ The strangeness of your story put
3 654 Heaviness in me.
3 655 
3 656 _Pros._        Shake it off. Come on;
3 657 We’ll visit Caliban my slave, who never
3 658 Yields us kind answer.
3 659 
3 660 _Mir._               ’Tis a villain, sir,
3 661 I do not love to look on.
3 662 
3 663 _Pros._                 But, as ’tis,                              310
3 664 We cannot miss him: he does make our fire,
3 665 Fetch in our wood, and serves in offices
3 666 That profit us. What, ho! slave! Caliban!
3 667 Thou earth, thou! speak.
3 668 
3 669 _Cal._ [_within_] There’s wood enough within.
3 670 
3 671 _Pros._ Come forth, I say! there’s other business for thee:        315
3 672 Come, thou tortoise! when?
3 673 
3 674   _Re-enter ARIEL like a water-nymph._
3 675 
3 676 Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel,
3 677 Hark in thine ear.
3 678 
3 679 _Ari._           My lord, it shall be done.    [_Exit._
3 680 
3 681 _Pros._ Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself
3 682 Upon thy wicked dam, come forth!                                   320
3 683 
3 684   _Enter CALIBAN._
3 685 
3 686 _Cal._ As wicked dew as e’er my mother brush’d
3 687 With raven’s feather from unwholesome fen
3 688 Drop on you both! a south-west blow on ye
3 689 And blister you all o’er!
3 690 
3 691 _Pros._ For this, be sure, to-night thou shalt have cramps,        325
3 692 Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up; urchins
3 693 Shall, for that vast of night that they may work,
3 694 All exercise on thee; thou shalt be pinch’d
3 695 As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging
3 696 Than bees that made ’em.
3 697 
3 698 _Cal._                 I must eat my dinner.                       330
3 699 This island’s mine, by Sycorax my mother,
3 700 Which thou takest from me. When thou camest first,
3 701 Thou strokedst me, and madest much of me; wouldst give me
3 702 Water with berries in’t; and teach me how
3 703 To name the bigger light, and how the less,                        335
3 704 That burn by day and night: and then I loved thee,
3 705 And show’d thee all the qualities o’ th’ isle,
3 706 The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile:
3 707 Curs’d be I that did so! All the charms
3 708 Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!                    340
3 709 For I am all the subjects that you have,
3 710 Which first was mine own king: and here you sty me
3 711 In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me
3 712 The rest o’ th’ island.
3 713 
3 714 _Pros._               Thou most lying slave,
3 715 Whom stripes may move, not kindness! I have used thee,             345
3 716 Filth as thou art, with human care; and lodged thee
3 717 In mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate
3 718 The honour of my child.
3 719 
3 720 _Cal._ O ho, O ho! would ’t had been done!
3 721 Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled else                          350
3 722 This isle with Calibans.
3 723 
3 724 _Pros._                Abhorred slave,
3 725 Which any print of goodness wilt not take,
3 726 Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee,
3 727 Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour
3 728 One thing or other: when thou didst not, savage,                   355
3 729 Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like
3 730 A thing most brutish, I endow’d thy purposes
3 731 With words that made them known. But thy vile race,
3 732 Though thou didst learn, had that in’t which good natures
3 733 Could not abide to be with; therefore wast thou                    360
3 734 Deservedly confined into this rock,
3 735 Who hadst deserved more than a prison.
3 736 
3 737 _Cal._ You taught me language; and my profit on’t
3 738 Is, I know how to curse. The red plague rid you
3 739 For learning me your language!
3 740 
3 741 _Pros._                      Hag-seed, hence!                      365
3 742 Fetch us in fuel; and be quick, thou’rt best,
3 743 To answer other business. Shrug’st thou, malice?
3 744 If thou neglect’st, or dost unwillingly
3 745 What I command, I’ll rack thee with old cramps,
3 746 Fill all thy bones with aches, make thee roar,                     370
3 747 That beasts shall tremble at thy din.
3 748 
3 749 _Cal._                              No, pray thee.
3 750 [_Aside_] I must obey: his art is of such power,
3 751 It would control my dam’s god, Setebos,
3 752 And make a vassal of him.
3 753 
3 754 _Pros._                 So, slave; hence!    [_Exit Caliban._
3 755 
3 756   _Re-enter ARIEL, invisible, playing and singing; FERDINAND
3 757   following._
3 758 
3 759 _ARIEL’S song._
3 760 
3 761     Come unto these yellow sands,                                  375
3 762         And then take hands:
3 763     Courtsied when you have and kiss’d
3 764         The wild waves whist:
3 765     Foot it featly here and there;
3 766     And, sweet sprites, the burthen bear.                          380
3 767 
3 768  _Burthen_ [_dispersedly_]. Hark, hark!
3 769                            Bow-wow.
3 770         The watch-dogs bark:
3 771                             Bow-wow.
3 772 
3 773 _Ari._  Hark, hark! I hear
3 774         The strain of strutting chanticleer                        385
3 775         Cry, Cock-a-diddle-dow.
3 776 
3 777 _Fer._ Where should this music be? i’ th’ air or th’ earth?
3 778 It sounds no more: and, sure, it waits upon
3 779 Some god o’ th’ island. Sitting on a bank,
3 780 Weeping again the king my father’s wreck,                          390
3 781 This music crept by me upon the waters,
3 782 Allaying both their fury and my passion
3 783 With its sweet air: thence I have follow’d it.
3 784 Or it hath drawn me rather. But ’tis gone.
3 785 No, it begins again.                                               395
3 786 
3 787 _ARIEL sings._
3 788 
3 789     Full fathom five thy father lies;
3 790         Of his bones are coral made;
3 791     Those are pearls that were his eyes:
3 792         Nothing of him that doth fade,
3 793     But doth suffer a sea-change                                   400
3 794     Into something rich and strange.
3 795     Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell:
3 796 
3 797                     _Burthen:_ Ding-dong.
3 798 
3 799 _Ari._ Hark! now I hear them,--Ding-dong, bell.
3 800 
3 801 _Fer._ The ditty does remember my drown’d father.                  405
3 802 This is no mortal business, nor no sound
3 803 That the earth owes:--I hear it now above me.
3 804 
3 805 _Pros._ The fringed curtains of thine eye advance,
3 806 And say what thou seest yond.
3 807 
3 808 _Mir._                      What is’t? a spirit?
3 809 Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,                         410
3 810 It carries a brave form. But ’tis a spirit.
3 811 
3 812 _Pros._ No, wench; it eats and sleeps and hath such senses
3 813 As we have, such. This gallant which thou seest
3 814 Was in the wreck; and, but he’s something stain’d
3 815 With grief, that’s beauty’s canker, thou mightst call him          415
3 816 A goodly person: he hath lost his fellows,
3 817 And strays about to find ’em.
3 818 
3 819 _Mir._                      I might call him
3 820 A thing divine; for nothing natural
3 821 I ever saw so noble.
3 822 
3 823 _Pros._ [_Aside_] It goes on, I see,
3 824 As my soul prompts it. Spirit, fine spirit! I’ll free thee         420
3 825 Within two days for this.
3 826 
3 827 _Fer._                  Most sure, the goddess
3 828 On whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe my prayer
3 829 May know if you remain upon this island;
3 830 And that you will some good instruction give
3 831 How I may bear me here: my prime request,                          425
3 832 Which I do last pronounce, is, O you wonder!
3 833 If you be maid or no?
3 834 
3 835 _Mir._              No wonder, sir;
3 836 But certainly a maid.
3 837 
3 838 _Fer._              My language! heavens!
3 839 I am the best of them that speak this speech,
3 840 Were I but where ’tis spoken.
3 841 
3 842 _Pros._                     How? the best?                         430
3 843 What wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee?
3 844 
3 845 _Fer._ A single thing, as I am now, that wonders
3 846 To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me;
3 847 And that he does I weep: myself am Naples,
3 848 Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld                     435
3 849 The king my father wreck’d.
3 850 
3 851 _Mir._                    Alack, for mercy!
3 852 
3 853 _Fer._ Yes, faith, and all his lords; the Duke of Milan
3 854 And his brave son being twain.
3 855 
3 856 _Pros._                      [_Aside_] The Duke of Milan
3 857 And his more braver daughter could control thee,
3 858 If now ’twere fit to do’t. At the first sight                      440
3 859 They have changed eyes. Delicate Ariel,
3 860 I’ll set thee free for this. [_To Fer._] A word, good sir;
3 861 I fear you have done yourself some wrong: a word.
3 862 
3 863 _Mir._ Why speaks my father so ungently? This
3 864 Is the third man that e’er I saw; the first                        445
3 865 That e’er I sigh’d for: pity move my father
3 866 To be inclined my way!
3 867 
3 868 _Fer._               O, if a virgin,
3 869 And your affection not gone forth, I’ll make you
3 870 The queen of Naples.
3 871 
3 872 _Pros._            Soft, sir! one word more.
3 873 [_Aside_] They are both in either’s powers:
3 874         but this swift business                                    450
3 875 I must uneasy make, lest too light winning
3 876 Make the prize light. [_To Fer._] One word more; I charge thee
3 877 That thou attend me: thou dost here usurp
3 878 The name thou owest not; and hast put thyself
3 879 Upon this island as a spy, to win it                               455
3 880 From me, the lord on’t.
3 881 
3 882 _Fer._                No, as I am a man.
3 883 
3 884 _Mir._ There’s nothing ill can dwell in such a temple:
3 885 If the ill spirit have so fair a house,
3 886 Good things will strive to dwell with’t.
3 887 
3 888 _Pros._                                Follow me.
3 889 Speak not you for him; he’s a traitor. Come;                       460
3 890 I’ll manacle thy neck and feet together:
3 891 Sea-water shalt thou drink; thy food shall be
3 892 The fresh-brook muscles, wither’d roots, and husks
3 893 Wherein the acorn cradled. Follow.
3 894 
3 895 _Fer._                           No;
3 896 I will resist such entertainment till                              465
3 897 Mine enemy has more power.
3 898             [_Draws, and is charmed from moving._
3 899 
3 900 _Mir._                O dear father,
3 901 Make not too rash a trial of him, for
3 902 He’s gentle, and not fearful.
3 903 
3 904 _Pros._                     What! I say,
3 905 My foot my tutor? Put thy sword up, traitor;
3 906 Who makest a show, but darest not strike, thy conscience           470
3 907 Is so possess’d with guilt: come from thy ward;
3 908 For I can here disarm thee with this stick
3 909 And make thy weapon drop.
3 910 
3 911 _Mir._                  Beseech you, father.
3 912 
3 913 _Pros._ Hence! hang not on my garments.
3 914 
3 915 _Mir._                                Sir, have pity;
3 916 I’ll be his surety.
3 917 
3 918 _Pros._           Silence! one word more                           475
3 919 Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What!
3 920 An advocate for an impostor! hush!
3 921 Thou think’st there is no more such shapes as he,
3 922 Having seen but him and Caliban: foolish wench!
3 923 To the most of men this is a Caliban,                              480
3 924 And they to him are angels.
3 925 
3 926 _Mir._                    My affections
3 927 Are, then, most humble; I have no ambition
3 928 To see a goodlier man.
3 929 
3 930 _Pros._              Come on; obey:
3 931 Thy nerves are in their infancy again,
3 932 And have no vigour in them.
3 933 
3 934 _Fer._             So they are:                                    485
3 935 My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.
3 936 My father’s loss, the weakness which I feel,
3 937 The wreck of all my friends, nor this man’s threats,
3 938 To whom I am subdued, are but light to me,
3 939 Might I but through my prison once a day                           490
3 940 Behold this maid: all corners else o’ th’ earth
3 941 Let liberty make use of; space enough
3 942 Have I in such a prison.
3 943 
3 944 _Pros._ [_Aside_]      It works. [_To Fer._] Come on.
3 945 Thou hast done well, fine Ariel! [_To Fer._] Follow me.
3 946 [_To Ari._] Hark what thou else shalt do me.
3 947 
3 948 _Mir._                                     Be of comfort;          495
3 949 My father’s of a better nature, sir,
3 950 Than he appears by speech: this is unwonted
3 951 Which now came from him.
3 952 
3 953 _Pros._                Thou shalt be as free
3 954 As mountain winds: but then exactly do
3 955 All points of my command.
3 956 
3 957 _Ari._                  To the syllable.                           500
3 958 
3 959 _Pros._ Come, follow. Speak not for him.    [_Exeunt._

3 1135 ACT II.
3 1136 
3 1137 
3 1138 SCENE I. _Another part of the island._
3 1139 
3 1140   _Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO, ADRIAN, FRANCISCO,
3 1141   and others._
3 1142 
3 1143 _Gon._ Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause,
3 1144 So have we all, of joy; for our escape
3 1145 Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe
3 1146 Is common; every day, some sailor’s wife,
3 1147 The masters of some merchant, and the merchant,                      5
3 1148 Have just our theme of woe; but for the miracle,
3 1149 I mean our preservation, few in millions
3 1150 Can speak like us: then wisely, good sir, weigh
3 1151 Our sorrow with our comfort.
3 1152 
3 1153 _Alon._                    Prithee, peace.
3 1154 
3 1155 _Seb._ He receives comfort like cold porridge.                      10
3 1156 
3 1157 _Ant._ The visitor will not give him o’er so.
3 1158 
3 1159 _Seb._ Look, he’s winding up the watch of his wit; by
3 1160 and by it will strike.
3 1161 
3 1162 _Gon._ Sir,--
3 1163 
3 1164 _Seb._ One: tell.                                                   15
3 1165 
3 1166 _Gon._ When every grief is entertain’d that’s offer’d,
3 1167 Comes to the entertainer--
3 1168 
3 1169 _Seb._ A dollar.
3 1170 
3 1171 _Gon._ Dolour comes to him, indeed: you have spoken
3 1172 truer than you purposed.                                            20
3 1173 
3 1174 _Seb._ You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should.
3 1175 
3 1176 _Gon._ Therefore, my lord,--
3 1177 
3 1178 _Ant._ Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!
3 1179 
3 1180 _Alon._ I prithee, spare.
3 1181 
3 1182 _Gon._ Well, I have done: but yet,--                                25
3 1183 
3 1184 _Seb._ He will be talking.
3 1185 
3 1186 _Ant._ Which, of he or Adrian, for a good wager, first
3 1187 begins to crow?
3 1188 
3 1189 _Seb._ The old cock.
3 1190 
3 1191 _Ant._ The cockerel.                                                30
3 1192 
3 1193 _Seb._ Done. The wager?
3 1194 
3 1195 _Ant._ A laughter.
3 1196 
3 1197 _Seb._ A match!
3 1198 
3 1199 _Adr._ Though this island seem to be desert,--
3 1200 
3 1201 _Seb._ Ha, ha, ha!--So, you’re paid.                                35
3 1202 
3 1203 _Adr._ Uninhabitable, and almost inaccessible,--
3 1204 
3 1205 _Seb._ Yet,--
3 1206 
3 1207 _Adr._ Yet,--
3 1208 
3 1209 _Ant._ He could not miss’t.
3 1210 
3 1211 _Adr._ It must needs be of subtle, tender and delicate              40
3 1212 temperance.
3 1213 
3 1214 _Ant._ Temperance was a delicate wench.
3 1215 
3 1216 _Seb._ Ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly delivered.
3 1217 
3 1218 _Adr._ The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.
3 1219 
3 1220 _Seb._ As if it had lungs, and rotten ones.                         45
3 1221 
3 1222 _Ant._ Or as ’twere perfumed by a fen.
3 1223 
3 1224 _Gon._ Here is every thing advantageous to life.
3 1225 
3 1226 _Ant._ True; save means to live.
3 1227 
3 1228 _Seb._ Of that there’s none, or little.
3 1229 
3 1230 _Gon._ How lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!               50
3 1231 
3 1232 _Ant._ The ground, indeed, is tawny.
3 1233 
3 1234 _Seb._ With an eye of green in’t.
3 1235 
3 1236 _Ant._ He misses not much.
3 1237 
3 1238 _Seb._ No; he doth but mistake the truth totally.
3 1239 
3 1240 _Gon._ But the rarity of it is,--which is indeed almost             55
3 1241 beyond credit,--
3 1242 
3 1243 _Seb._ As many vouched rarities are.
3 1244 
3 1245 _Gon._ That our garments, being, as they were, drenched
3 1246 in the sea, hold, notwithstanding, their freshness and glosses,
3 1247 being rather new-dyed than stained with salt water.                 60
3 1248 
3 1249 _Ant._ If but one of his pockets could speak, would it
3 1250 not say he lies?
3 1251 
3 1252 _Seb._ Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report.
3 1253 
3 1254 _Gon._ Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when
3 1255 we put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of the king’s        65
3 1256 fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.
3 1257 
3 1258 _Seb._ ’Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in
3 1259 our return.
3 1260 
3 1261 _Adr._ Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon
3 1262 to their queen.                                                     70
3 1263 
3 1264 _Gon._ Not since widow Dido’s time.
3 1265 
3 1266 _Ant._ Widow! a pox o’ that! How came that widow
3 1267 in? widow Dido!
3 1268 
3 1269 _Seb._ What if he had said ‘widower Æneas’ too? Good
3 1270 Lord, how you take it!                                              75
3 1271 
3 1272 _Adr._ ‘Widow Dido’ said you? you make me study of
3 1273 that: she was of Carthage, not of Tunis.
3 1274 
3 1275 _Gon._ This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.
3 1276 
3 1277 _Adr._ Carthage?
3 1278 
3 1279 _Gon._ I assure you, Carthage.                                      80
3 1280 
3 1281 _Seb._ His word is more than the miraculous harp; he
3 1282 hath raised the wall, and houses too.
3 1283 
3 1284 _Ant._ What impossible matter will he make easy next?
3 1285 
3 1286 _Seb._ I think he will carry this island home in his
3 1287 pocket, and give it his son for an apple.                           85
3 1288 
3 1289 _Ant._ And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring
3 1290 forth more islands.
3 1291 
3 1292 _Gon._ Ay.
3 1293 
3 1294 _Ant._ Why, in good time.
3 1295 
3 1296 _Gon._ Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now              90
3 1297 as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage of your
3 1298 daughter, who is now queen.
3 1299 
3 1300 _Ant._ And the rarest that e’er came there.
3 1301 
3 1302 _Seb._ Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.
3 1303 
3 1304 _Ant._ O, widow Dido! ay, widow Dido.                               95
3 1305 
3 1306 _Gon._ Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I
3 1307 wore it? I mean, in a sort.
3 1308 
3 1309 _Ant._ That sort was well fished for.
3 1310 
3 1311 _Gon._ When I wore it at your daughter’s marriage?
3 1312 
3 1313 _Alon._ You cram these words into mine ears against                100
3 1314 The stomach of my sense. Would I had never
3 1315 Married my daughter there! for, coming thence,
3 1316 My son is lost, and, in my rate, she too.
3 1317 Who is so far from Italy removed
3 1318 I ne’er again shall see her. O thou mine heir                      105
3 1319 Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish
3 1320 Hath made his meal on thee?
3 1321 
3 1322 _Fran._                   Sir, he may live:
3 1323 I saw him beat the surges under him,
3 1324 And ride upon their backs; he trod the water.
3 1325 Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted                          110
3 1326 The surge most swoln that met him; his bold head
3 1327 ’Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar’d
3 1328 Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke
3 1329 To the shore, that o’er his wave-worn basis bow’d,
3 1330 As stooping to relieve him: I not doubt                            115
3 1331 He came alive to land.
3 1332 
3 1333 _Alon._              No, no, he’s gone.
3 1334 
3 1335 _Seb._ Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,
3 1336 That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,
3 1337 But rather lose her to an African;
3 1338 Where she, at least, is banish’d from your eye,                    120
3 1339 Who hath cause to wet the grief on’t.
3 1340 
3 1341 _Alon._                             Prithee, peace.
3 1342 
3 1343 _Seb._ You were kneel’d to, and importuned otherwise,
3 1344 By all of us; and the fair soul herself
3 1345 Weigh’d between loathness and obedience, at
3 1346 Which end o’ the beam should bow. We have lost your son,           125
3 1347 I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have
3 1348 More widows in them of this business’ making
3 1349 Than we bring men to comfort them:
3 1350 The fault’s your own.
3 1351 
3 1352 _Alon._             So is the dear’st o’ the loss.
3 1353 
3 1354 _Gon._ My lord Sebastian,                                          130
3 1355 The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness,
3 1356 And time to speak it in: you rub the sore,
3 1357 When you should bring the plaster.
3 1358 
3 1359 _Seb._                           Very well.
3 1360 
3 1361 _Ant._ And most chirurgeonly.
3 1362 
3 1363 _Gon._ It is foul weather in us all, good sir,                     135
3 1364 When you are cloudy.
3 1365 
3 1366 _Seb._             Foul weather?
3 1367 
3 1368 _Ant._                         Very foul.
3 1369 
3 1370 _Gon._ Had I plantation of this isle, my lord,--
3 1371 
3 1372 _Ant._ He’ld sow’t with nettle-seed.
3 1373 
3 1374 _Seb._                             Or docks, or mallows.
3 1375 
3 1376 _Gon._ And were the king on’t, what would I do?
3 1377 
3 1378 _Seb._ ’Scape being drunk for want of wine.                        140
3 1379 
3 1380 _Gon._ I’ the commonwealth I would by contraries
3 1381 Execute all things; for no kind of traffic
3 1382 Would I admit; no name of magistrate;
3 1383 Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,
3 1384 And use of service, none; contract, succession,                    145
3 1385 Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;
3 1386 No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;
3 1387 No occupation; all men idle, all;
3 1388 And women too, but innocent and pure;
3 1389 No sovereignty;--                                                  150
3 1390 
3 1391 _Seb._      Yet he would be king on’t.
3 1392 
3 1393 _Ant._ The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the
3 1394 beginning.
3 1395 
3 1396 _Gon._ All things in common nature should produce
3 1397 Without sweat or endeavour: treason, felony,
3 1398 Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,                    155
3 1399 Would I not have; but nature should bring forth,
3 1400 Of its own kind, all foison, all abundance,
3 1401 To feed my innocent people.
3 1402 
3 1403 _Seb._ No marrying ’mong his subjects?
3 1404 
3 1405 _Ant._ None, man; all idle; whores and knaves.                     160
3 1406 
3 1407 _Gon._ I would with such perfection govern, sir,
3 1408 To excel the golden age.
3 1409 
3 1410 _Seb._                 ’Save his majesty!
3 1411 
3 1412 _Ant._ Long live Gonzalo!
3 1413 
3 1414 _Gon._                  And,--do you mark me, sir?
3 1415 
3 1416 _Alon._ Prithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me.
3 1417 
3 1418 _Gon._ I do well believe your highness; and did it to minister     165
3 1419 occasion to these gentlemen, who are of such sensible
3 1420 and nimble lungs that they always use to laugh at nothing.
3 1421 
3 1422 _Ant._ ’Twas you we laughed at.
3 1423 
3 1424 _Gon._ Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing to
3 1425 you: so you may continue, and laugh at nothing still.              170
3 1426 
3 1427 _Ant._ What a blow was there given!
3 1428 
3 1429 _Seb._ An it had not fallen flat-long.
3 1430 
3 1431 _Gon._ You are gentlemen of brave mettle; you would
3 1432 lift the moon out of her sphere, if she would continue in it
3 1433 five weeks without changing.                                       175
3 1434 
3 1435 
3 1436   _Enter ARIEL (invisible) playing solemn music._
3 1437 
3 1438 _Seb._ We would so, and then go a bat-fowling.
3 1439 
3 1440 _Ant._ Nay, good my lord, be not angry.
3 1441 
3 1442 _Gon._ No, I warrant you; I will not adventure my discretion
3 1443 so weakly. Will you laugh me asleep, for I am very
3 1444 heavy?                                                             180
3 1445 
3 1446 _Ant._ Go sleep, and hear us.
3 1447             [_All sleep except Alon., Seb., and Ant._
3 1448 
3 1449 _Alon._ What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes
3 1450 Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find
3 1451 They are inclined to do so.
3 1452 
3 1453 _Seb._                    Please you, sir,
3 1454 Do not omit the heavy offer of it:                                 185
3 1455 It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,
3 1456 It is a comforter.
3 1457 
3 1458 _Ant._           We two, my lord,
3 1459 Will guard your person while you take your rest,
3 1460 And watch your safety.
3 1461 
3 1462 _Alon._              Thank you.--Wondrous heavy.
3 1463                                 [_Alonso sleeps. Exit Ariel._
3 1464 
3 1465 _Seb._ What a strange drowsiness possesses them!                   190
3 1466 
3 1467 _Ant._ It is the quality o’ the climate.
3 1468 
3 1469 _Seb._                                 Why
3 1470 Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not
3 1471 Myself disposed to sleep.
3 1472 
3 1473 _Ant._                  Nor I; my spirits are nimble.
3 1474 They fell together all, as by consent;
3 1475 They dropp’d, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,                  195
3 1476 Worthy Sebastian?--O, what might?--No more:--
3 1477 And yet methinks I see it in thy face,
3 1478 What thou shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee; and
3 1479 My strong imagination sees a crown
3 1480 Dropping upon thy head.
3 1481 
3 1482 _Seb._                What, art thou waking?                       200
3 1483 
3 1484 _Ant._ Do you not hear me speak?
3 1485 
3 1486 _Seb._                         I do; and surely
3 1487 It is a sleepy language, and thou speak’st
3 1488 Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?
3 1489 This is a strange repose, to be asleep
3 1490 With eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving,                   205
3 1491 And yet so fast asleep.
3 1492 
3 1493 _Ant._                Noble Sebastian,
3 1494 Thou let’st thy fortune sleep--die, rather; wink’st
3 1495 Whiles thou art waking.
3 1496 
3 1497 _Seb._                Thou dost snore distinctly;
3 1498 There’s meaning in thy snores.
3 1499 
3 1500 _Ant._ I am more serious than my custom: you                       210
3 1501 Must be so too, if heed me; which to do
3 1502 Trebles thee o’er.
3 1503 
3 1504 _Seb._           Well, I am standing water.
3 1505 
3 1506 _Ant._ I’ll teach you how to flow.
3 1507 
3 1508 _Seb._                           Do so: to ebb
3 1509 Hereditary sloth instructs me.
3 1510 
3 1511 _Ant._                       O,
3 1512 If you but knew how you the purpose cherish                        215
3 1513 Whiles thus you mock it! how, in stripping it,
3 1514 You more invest it! Ebbing men, indeed,
3 1515 Most often do so near the bottom run
3 1516 By their own fear or sloth.
3 1517 
3 1518 _Seb._                    Prithee, say on:
3 1519 The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim                        220
3 1520 A matter from thee; and a birth, indeed,
3 1521 Which throes thee much to yield.
3 1522 
3 1523 _Ant._                         Thus, sir:
3 1524 Although this lord of weak remembrance, this,
3 1525 Who shall be of as little memory
3 1526 When he is earth’d, hath here almost persuaded,--                  225
3 1527 For he’s a spirit of persuasion, only
3 1528 Professes to persuade,--the king his son’s alive,
3 1529 ’Tis as impossible that he’s undrown’d
3 1530 As he that sleeps here swims.
3 1531 
3 1532 _Seb._                      I have no hope
3 1533 That he’s undrown’d.
3 1534 
3 1535 _Ant._             O, out of that ‘no hope’                        230
3 1536 What great hope have you! no hope that way is
3 1537 Another way so high a hope that even
3 1538 Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond,
3 1539 But doubt discovery there. Will you grant with me
3 1540 That Ferdinand is drown’d?
3 1541 
3 1542 _Seb._                   He’s gone.
3 1543 
3 1544 _Ant._                            Then, tell me,                   235
3 1545 Who’s the next heir of Naples?
3 1546 
3 1547 _Seb._                       Claribel.
3 1548 
3 1549 _Ant._ She that is queen of Tunis; she that dwells
3 1550 Ten leagues beyond man’s life; she that from Naples
3 1551 Can have no note, unless the sun were post,--
3 1552 The man i’ the moon’s too slow,--till new-born chins               240
3 1553 Be rough and razorable; she that from whom
3 1554 We all were sea-swallow’d, though some cast again,
3 1555 And by that destiny, to perform an act
3 1556 Whereof what’s past is prologue; what to come,
3 1557 In yours and my discharge.
3 1558 
3 1559 _Seb._                   What stuff is this! How say you?          245
3 1560 ’Tis true, my brother’s daughter’s queen of Tunis;
3 1561 So is she heir of Naples; ’twixt which regions
3 1562 There is some space.
3 1563 
3 1564 _Ant._             A space whose every cubit
3 1565 Seems to cry out, “How shall that Claribel
3 1566 Measure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis,                          250
3 1567 And let Sebastian wake.” Say, this were death
3 1568 That now hath seized them; why, they were no worse
3 1569 Than now they are. There be that can rule Naples
3 1570 As well as he that sleeps; lords that can prate
3 1571 As amply and unnecessarily                                         255
3 1572 As this Gonzalo; I myself could make
3 1573 A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore
3 1574 The mind that I do! what a sleep were this
3 1575 For your advancement! Do you understand me?
3 1576 
3 1577 _Seb._ Methinks I do.
3 1578 
3 1579 _Ant._              And how does your content                      260
3 1580 Tender your own good fortune?
3 1581 
3 1582 _Seb._                      I remember
3 1583 You did supplant your brother Prospero.
3 1584 
3 1585 _Ant._                                True:
3 1586 And look how well my garments sit upon me;
3 1587 Much feater than before: my brother’s servants
3 1588 Were then my fellows; now they are my men.                         265
3 1589 
3 1590 _Seb._ But for your conscience.
3 1591 
3 1592 _Ant._ Ay, sir; where lies that? if ’twere a kibe,
3 1593 ’Twould put me to my slipper: but I feel not
3 1594 This deity in my bosom: twenty consciences,
3 1595 That stand ’twixt me and Milan, candied be they,                   270
3 1596 And melt, ere they molest! Here lies your brother,
3 1597 No better than the earth he lies upon,
3 1598 If he were that which now he’s like, that’s dead;
3 1599 Whom I, with this obedient steel, three inches of it,
3 1600 Can lay to bed for ever; whiles you, doing thus,                   275
3 1601 To the perpetual wink for aye might put
3 1602 This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who
3 1603 Should not upbraid our course. For all the rest,
3 1604 They’ll take suggestion as a cat laps milk;
3 1605 They’ll tell the clock to any business that                        280
3 1606 We say befits the hour.
3 1607 
3 1608 _Seb._                Thy case, dear friend,
3 1609 Shall be my precedent; as thou got’st Milan,
3 1610 I’ll come by Naples. Draw thy sword: one stroke
3 1611 Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest;
3 1612 And I the king shall love thee.
3 1613 
3 1614 _Ant._                        Draw together;                       285
3 1615 And when I rear my hand, do you the like,
3 1616 To fall it on Gonzalo.
3 1617 
3 1618 _Seb._               O, but one word.      [_They talk apart._
3 1619 
3 1620   _Re-enter ARIEL invisible._
3 1621 
3 1622 _Ari._ My master through his art foresees the danger
3 1623 That you, his friend, are in; and sends me forth,--
3 1624 For else his project dies,--to keep them living.                   290
3 1625                             [_Sings in Gonzalo’s ear._
3 1626 
3 1627 While you here do snoring lie,
3 1628 Open-eyed conspiracy
3 1629     His time doth take.
3 1630 If of life you keep a care,
3 1631 Shake off slumber, and beware:                                     295
3 1632     Awake, awake!
3 1633 
3 1634 _Ant._ Then let us both be sudden.
3 1635 
3 1636 _Gon._                           Now, good angels
3 1637 Preserve the king!                          [_They wake._
3 1638 
3 1639 _Alon._ Why, how now? ho, awake!--Why are you drawn?
3 1640 Wherefore this ghastly looking?
3 1641 
3 1642 _Gon._                        What’s the matter?                   300
3 1643 
3 1644 _Seb._ Whiles we stood here securing your repose,
3 1645 Even now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing
3 1646 Like bulls, or rather lions: did’t not wake you?
3 1647 It struck mine ear most terribly.
3 1648 
3 1649 _Alon._                         I heard nothing.
3 1650 
3 1651 _Ant._ O, ’twas a din to fright a monster’s ear,                   305
3 1652 To make an earthquake! sure, it was the roar
3 1653 Of a whole herd of lions.
3 1654 
3 1655 _Alon._                 Heard you this, Gonzalo?
3 1656 
3 1657 _Gon._ Upon mine honour, sir, I heard a humming,
3 1658 And that a strange one too, which did awake me:
3 1659 I shaked you, sir, and cried: as mine eyes open’d,                 310
3 1660 I saw their weapons drawn:--there was a noise,
3 1661 That’s verily. ’Tis best we stand upon our guard,
3 1662 Or that we quit this place: let’s draw our weapons.
3 1663 
3 1664 _Alon._ Lead off this ground; and let’s make further search
3 1665 For my poor son.
3 1666 
3 1667 _Gon._         Heavens keep him from these beasts!                 315
3 1668 For he is, sure, i’ th’ island.
3 1669 
3 1670 _Alon._                       Lead away.
3 1671 
3 1672 _Ari._ Prospero my lord shall know what I have done:
3 1673 So, king, go safely on to seek thy son.    [_Exeunt._

3 1771 SCENE II. _Another part of the island._
3 1772 
3 1773   _Enter CALIBAN with a burden of wood. A noise of thunder heard._
3 1774 
3 1775 _Cal._ All the infections that the sun sucks up
3 1776 From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall, and make him
3 1777 By inch-meal a disease! His spirits hear me,
3 1778 And yet I needs must curse. But they’ll nor pinch,
3 1779 Fright me with urchin-shows, pitch me i’ the mire,                   5
3 1780 Nor lead me, like a firebrand, in the dark
3 1781 Out of my way, unless he bid ’em: but
3 1782 For every trifle are they set upon me;
3 1783 Sometime like apes, that mow and chatter at me,
3 1784 And after bite me; then like hedgehogs, which                       10
3 1785 Lie tumbling in my barefoot way, and mount
3 1786 Their pricks at my footfall; sometime am I
3 1787 All wound with adders, who with cloven tongues
3 1788 Do hiss me into madness.
3 1789 
3 1790   _Enter TRINCULO._
3 1791 
3 1792                         Lo, now, lo!
3 1793 Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment me                       15
3 1794 For bringing wood in slowly. I’ll fall flat;
3 1795 Perchance he will not mind me.
3 1796 
3 1797 _Trin._ Here’s neither bush nor shrub, to bear off any
3 1798 weather at all, and another storm brewing; I hear it sing i’
3 1799 the wind: yond same black cloud, yond huge one, looks               20
3 1800 like a foul bombard that would shed his liquor. If it should
3 1801 thunder as it did before, I know not where to hide my head:
3 1802 yond same cloud cannot choose but fall by pailfuls. What
3 1803 have we here? a man or a fish? dead or alive? A fish: he
3 1804 smells like a fish; a very ancient and fish-like smell; a kind      25
3 1805 of not of the newest Poor-John. A strange fish! Were I
3 1806 in England now, as once I was, and had but this fish
3 1807 painted, not a holiday fool there but would give a piece of
3 1808 silver: there would this monster make a man; any strange
3 1809 beast there makes a man: when they will not give a doit to          30
3 1810 relieve a lame beggar, they will lay out ten to see a dead
3 1811 Indian. Legged like a man! and his fins like arms! Warm
3 1812 o’ my troth! I do now let loose my opinion; hold it no
3 1813 longer: this is no fish, but an islander, that hath lately
3 1814 suffered by a thunderbolt. [_Thunder._] Alas, the storm is come     35
3 1815 again! my best way is to creep under his gaberdine; there
3 1816 is no other shelter hereabout: misery acquaints a man with
3 1817 strange bed-fellows. I will here shroud till the dregs of the
3 1818 storm be past.
3 1819 
3 1820   _Enter STEPHANO, singing: a bottle in his hand._
3 1821 
3 1822 _Ste._ I shall no more to sea, to sea,                              40
3 1823                 Here shall I die a-shore,--
3 1824 
3 1825 This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man’s funeral: well,
3 1826 here’s my comfort.                                  [_Drinks._
3 1827 
3 1828 
3 1829 [_Sings._ The master, the swabber, the boatswain, and I,
3 1830                        The gunner, and his mate,                    45
3 1831                Loved Mall, Meg, and Marian, and Margery,
3 1832                    But none of us cared for Kate;
3 1833                    For she had a tongue with a tang,
3 1834                    Would cry to a sailor, Go hang!
3 1835                She loved not the savour of tar nor of pitch;        50
3 1836                Yet a tailor might scratch her where’er she did itch.
3 1837                    Then, to sea, boys, and let her go hang!
3 1838 
3 1839 This is a scurvy tune too: but here’s my comfort. [_Drinks._
3 1840 
3 1841 _Cal._ Do not torment me:--O!
3 1842 
3 1843 _Ste._ What’s the matter? Have we devils here? Do                   55
3 1844 you put tricks upon ’s with savages and men of Ind, ha? I
3 1845 have not scaped drowning, to be afeard now of your four
3 1846 legs; for it hath been said, As proper a man as ever went
3 1847 on four legs cannot make him give ground; and it shall be
3 1848 said so again, while Stephano breathes at’s nostrils.               60
3 1849 
3 1850 _Cal._ The spirit torments me:--O!
3 1851 
3 1852 _Ste._ This is some monster of the isle with four legs, who
3 1853 hath got, as I take it, an ague. Where the devil should he
3 1854 learn our language? I will give him some relief, if it be
3 1855 but for that. If I can recover him, and keep him tame, and          65
3 1856 get to Naples with him, he’s a present for any emperor that
3 1857 ever trod on neat’s-leather.
3 1858 
3 1859 _Cal._ Do not torment me, prithee; I’ll bring my wood
3 1860 home faster.
3 1861 
3 1862 _Ste._ He’s in his fit now, and does not talk after the             70
3 1863 wisest. He shall taste of my bottle: if he have never drunk
3 1864 wine afore, it will go near to remove his fit. If I can recover
3 1865 him, and keep him tame, I will not take too much for
3 1866 him; he shall pay for him that hath him, and that soundly.
3 1867 
3 1868 _Cal._ Thou dost me yet but little hurt; thou wilt anon, I          75
3 1869 know it by thy trembling: now Prosper works upon thee.
3 1870 
3 1871 _Ste._ Come on your ways; open your mouth; here is that
3 1872 which will give language to you, cat: open your mouth; this
3 1873 will shake your shaking, I can tell you, and that soundly:
3 1874 you cannot tell who’s your friend: open your chaps again.           80
3 1875 
3 1876 _Trin._ I should know that voice: it should be--but he
3 1877 is drowned; and these are devils:--O defend me!
3 1878 
3 1879 _Ste._ Four legs and two voices,--a most delicate monster!
3 1880 His forward voice, now, is to speak well of his friend;
3 1881 his backward voice is to utter foul speeches and to detract.        85
3 1882 If all the wine in my bottle will recover him, I will help
3 1883 his ague. Come:--Amen! I will pour some in thy other
3 1884 mouth.
3 1885 
3 1886 _Trin._ Stephano!
3 1887 
3 1888 _Ste._ Doth thy other mouth call me? Mercy, mercy!                  90
3 1889 This is a devil, and no monster: I will leave him; I have
3 1890 no long spoon.
3 1891 
3 1892 _Trin._ Stephano! If thou beest Stephano, touch me,
3 1893 and speak to me; for I am Trinculo,--be not afeard,--thy
3 1894 good friend Trinculo.                                               95
3 1895 
3 1896 _Ste._ If thou beest Trinculo, come forth: I’ll pull thee
3 1897 by the lesser legs: if any be Trinculo’s legs, these are they.
3 1898 Thou art very Trinculo indeed! How earnest thou to be
3 1899 the siege of this moon-calf? can he vent Trinculos?
3 1900 
3 1901 _Trin._ I took him to be killed with a thunder-stroke.             100
3 1902 But art thou not drowned, Stephano? I hope, now, thou
3 1903 art not drowned. Is the storm overblown? I hid me
3 1904 under the dead moon-calf’s gaberdine for fear of the storm.
3 1905 And art thou living, Stephano? O Stephano, two Neapolitans
3 1906 scaped!                                                            105
3 1907 
3 1908 _Ste._ Prithee, do not turn me about; my stomach is not
3 1909 constant.
3 1910 
3 1911 _Cal._ [_aside_] These be fine things, an if they be not sprites.
3 1912 That’s a brave god, and bears celestial liquor:
3 1913 I will kneel to him.                                               110
3 1914 
3 1915 _Ste._ How didst thou ’scape? How camest thou hither?
3 1916 swear, by this bottle, how thou camest hither. I escaped
3 1917 upon a butt of sack, which the sailors heaved o’erboard, by
3 1918 this bottle! which I made of the bark of a tree with mine
3 1919 own hands, since I was cast ashore.                                115
3 1920 
3 1921 _Cal._ I’ll swear, upon that bottle, to be thy true subject;
3 1922 for the liquor is not earthly.
3 1923 
3 1924 _Ste._ Here; swear, then, how thou escapedst.
3 1925 
3 1926 _Trin._ Swum ashore, man, like a duck: I can swim
3 1927 like a duck, I’ll be sworn.                                        120
3 1928 
3 1929 _Ste._ Here, kiss the book. Though thou canst swim
3 1930 like a duck, thou art made like a goose.
3 1931 
3 1932 _Trin._ O Stephano, hast any more of this?
3 1933 
3 1934 _Ste._ The whole butt, man: my cellar is in a rock by
3 1935 the sea-side, where my wine is hid. How now, moon-calf!            125
3 1936 how does thine ague?
3 1937 
3 1938 _Cal._ Hast thou not dropp’d from heaven?
3 1939 
3 1940 _Ste._ Out o’ the moon, I do assure thee: I was the man
3 1941 i’ the moon when time was.
3 1942 
3 1943 _Cal._ I have seen thee in her, and I do adore thee:               130
3 1944 My mistress show’d me thee, and thy dog, and thy bush.
3 1945 
3 1946 _Ste._ Come, swear to that; kiss the book: I will furnish
3 1947 it anon with new contents: swear.
3 1948 
3 1949 _Trin._ By this good light, this is a very shallow monster!
3 1950 I afeard of him! A very weak monster! The                          135
3 1951 man i’ the moon! A most poor credulous monster! Well
3 1952 drawn, monster, in good sooth!
3 1953 
3 1954 _Cal._ I’ll show thee every fertile inch o’ th’ island;
3 1955 And I will kiss thy foot: I prithee, be my god.
3 1956 
3 1957 _Trin._ By this light, a most perfidious and drunken               140
3 1958 monster! when’s god’s asleep, he’ll rob his bottle.
3 1959 
3 1960 _Cal._ I’ll kiss thy foot; I’ll swear myself thy subject.
3 1961 
3 1962 _Ste._ Come on, then; down, and swear.
3 1963 
3 1964 _Trin._ I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed
3 1965 monster. A most scurvy monster! I could find in                    145
3 1966 my heart to beat him,--
3 1967 
3 1968 _Ste._ Come, kiss.
3 1969 
3 1970 _Trin._ But that the poor monster’s in drink: an abominable
3 1971 monster!
3 1972 
3 1973 _Cal._ I’ll show thee the best springs; I’ll pluck thee berries;   150
3 1974 I’ll fish for thee, and get thee wood enough.
3 1975 A plague upon the tyrant that I serve!
3 1976 I’ll bear him no more sticks, but follow thee,
3 1977 Thou wondrous man.
3 1978 
3 1979 _Trin._ A most ridiculous monster, to make a wonder                155
3 1980 of a poor drunkard!
3 1981 
3 1982 _Cal._ I prithee, let me bring thee where crabs grow;
3 1983 And I with my long nails will dig thee pig-nuts;
3 1984 Show thee a jay’s nest, and instruct thee how
3 1985 To snare the nimble marmoset; I’ll bring thee                      160
3 1986 To clustering filberts, and sometimes I’ll get thee
3 1987 Young scamels from the rock. Wilt thou go with me?
3 1988 
3 1989 _Ste._ I prithee now, lead the way, without any more
3 1990 talking. Trinculo, the king and all our company else being
3 1991 drowned, we will inherit here: here; bear my bottle: fellow        165
3 1992 Trinculo, we’ll fill him by and by again.
3 1993 
3 1994 _Cal. sings drunkenly._] Farewell, master; farewell, farewell!
3 1995 
3 1996 _Trin._ A howling monster; a drunken monster!
3 1997 
3 1998 _Cal._ No more dams I’ll make for fish;
3 1999                 Nor fetch in firing                                170
3 2000                 At requiring;
3 2001              Nor scrape trencher, nor wash dish:
3 2002                 ’Ban, ’Ban, Cacaliban
3 2003                 Has a new master:--get a new man.
3 2004 
3 2005 Freedom, hey-day! hey-day, freedom! freedom, hey-day,              175
3 2006 freedom!
3 2007 
3 2008 _Ste._ O brave monster! Lead the way.    [_Exeunt._

3 2047 
3 2048 SCENE I. _Before PROSPERO’S cell._
3 2049 
3 2050   _Enter FERDINAND, bearing a log._
3 2051 
3 2052 _Fer._ There be some sports are painful, and their labour
3 2053 Delight in them sets off: some kinds of baseness
3 2054 Are nobly undergone, and most poor matters
3 2055 Point to rich ends. This my mean task
3 2056 Would be as heavy to me as odious, but                               5
3 2057 The mistress which I serve quickens what’s dead,
3 2058 And makes my labours pleasures: O, she is
3 2059 Ten times more gentle than her father’s crabbed.
3 2060 And he’s composed of harshness. I must remove
3 2061 Some thousands of these logs, and pile them up,                     10
3 2062 Upon a sore injunction: my sweet mistress
3 2063 Weeps when she sees me work, and says, such baseness
3 2064 Had never like executor. I forget:
3 2065 But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours,
3 2066 Most busy lest, when I do it.
3 2067 
3 2068   _Enter MIRANDA; and PROSPERO at a distance, unseen._
3 2069 
3 2070 _Mir._                  Alas, now, pray you,                        15
3 2071 Work not so hard: I would the lightning had
3 2072 Burnt up those logs that you are enjoin’d to pile!
3 2073 Pray, set it down, and rest you: when this burns,
3 2074 ’Twill weep for having wearied you. My father
3 2075 Is hard at study; pray, now, rest yourself;                         20
3 2076 He’s safe for these three hours.
3 2077 
3 2078 _Fer._                         O most dear mistress,
3 2079 The sun will set before I shall discharge
3 2080 What I must strive to do.
3 2081 
3 2082 _Mir._                  If you’ll sit down,
3 2083 I’ll bear your logs the while: pray, give me that;
3 2084 I’ll carry it to the pile.
3 2085 
3 2086 _Fer._                   No, precious creature;                     25
3 2087 I had rather crack my sinews, break my back,
3 2088 Than you should such dishonour undergo,
3 2089 While I sit lazy by.
3 2090 
3 2091 _Mir._             It would become me
3 2092 As well as it does you: and I should do it
3 2093 With much more ease; for my good will is to it,                     30
3 2094 And yours it is against.
3 2095 
3 2096 _Pros._                Poor worm, thou art infected!
3 2097 This visitation shows it.
3 2098 
3 2099 _Mir._                  You look wearily.
3 2100 
3 2101 _Fer._ No, noble mistress; ’tis fresh morning with me
3 2102 When you are by at night. I do beseech you,--
3 2103 Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers,--                        35
3 2104 What is your name?
3 2105 
3 2106 _Mir._           Miranda. --O my father,
3 2107 I have broke your hest to say so!
3 2108 
3 2109 _Fer._                          Admired Miranda!
3 2110 Indeed the top of admiration! worth
3 2111 What’s dearest to the world! Full many a lady
3 2112 I have eyed with best regard, and many a time                       40
3 2113 The harmony of their tongues hath into bondage
3 2114 Brought my too diligent ear: for several virtues
3 2115 Have I liked several women; never any
3 2116 With so full soul, but some defect in her
3 2117 Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed,                        45
3 2118 And put it to the foil: but you, O you,
3 2119 So perfect and so peerless, are created
3 2120 Of every creature’s best!
3 2121 
3 2122 _Mir._             I do not know
3 2123 One of my sex; no woman’s face remember,
3 2124 Save, from my glass, mine own; nor have I seen                      50
3 2125 More that I may call men than you, good friend,
3 2126 And my dear father: how features are abroad,
3 2127 I am skilless of; but, by my modesty,
3 2128 The jewel in my dower, I would not wish
3 2129 Any companion in the world but you;                                 55
3 2130 Nor can imagination form a shape,
3 2131 Besides yourself, to like of. But I prattle
3 2132 Something too wildly, and my father’s precepts
3 2133 I therein do forget.
3 2134 
3 2135 _Fer._             I am, in my condition,
3 2136 A prince, Miranda; I do think, a king;                              60
3 2137 I would, not so!--and would no more endure
3 2138 This wooden slavery than to suffer
3 2139 The flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak:
3 2140 The very instant that I saw you, did
3 2141 My heart fly to your service; there resides,                        65
3 2142 To make me slave to it; and for your sake
3 2143 Am I this patient log-man.
3 2144 
3 2145 _Mir._                   Do you love me?
3 2146 
3 2147 _Fer._ O heaven, O earth, bear witness to this sound,
3 2148 And crown what I profess with kind event,
3 2149 If I speak true! if hollowly, invert                                70
3 2150 What best is boded me to mischief! I,
3 2151 Beyond all limit of what else i’ the world,
3 2152 Do love, prize, honour you.
3 2153 
3 2154 _Mir._                    I am a fool
3 2155 To weep at what I am glad of.
3 2156 
3 2157 _Pros._                     Fair encounter
3 2158 Of two most rare affections! Heavens rain grace                     75
3 2159 On that which breeds between ’em!
3 2160 
3 2161 _Fer._                          Wherefore weep you?
3 2162 
3 2163 _Mir._ At mine unworthiness, that dare not offer
3 2164 What I desire to give; and much less take
3 2165 What I shall die to want. But this is trifling;
3 2166 And all the more it seeks to hide itself,                           80
3 2167 The bigger bulk it shows. Hence, bashful cunning!
3 2168 And prompt me, plain and holy innocence!
3 2169 I am your wife, if you will marry me;
3 2170 If not, I’ll die your maid: to be your fellow
3 2171 You may deny me; but I’ll be your servant,                          85
3 2172 Whether you will or no.
3 2173 
3 2174 _Fer._                My mistress, dearest;
3 2175 And I thus humble ever.
3 2176 
3 2177 _Mir._                My husband, then?
3 2178 
3 2179 _Fer._ Ay, with a heart as willing
3 2180 As bondage e’er of freedom: here’s my hand.
3 2181 
3 2182 _Mir._ And mine, with my heart in’t: and now farewell               90
3 2183 Till half an hour hence.
3 2184 
3 2185 _Fer._                 A thousand thousand!
3 2186 
3 2187     [_Exeunt Fer. and Mir. severally._
3 2188 
3 2189 _Pros._ So glad of this as they I cannot be,
3 2190 Who are surprised withal; but my rejoicing
3 2191 At nothing can be more. I’ll to my book;
3 2192 For yet, ere supper-time, must I perform                            95
3 2193 Much business appertaining.    [_Exit._

3 2226 SCENE II. _Another part of the island._
3 2227 
3 2228   _Enter CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO._
3 2229 
3 2230 _Ste._ Tell not me;--when the butt is out, we will drink
3 2231 water; not a drop before: therefore bear up, and board ’em.
3 2232 Servant-monster, drink to me.
3 2233 
3 2234 _Trin._ Servant-monster! the folly of this island! They
3 2235 say there’s but five upon this isle: we are three of them; if        5
3 2236 th’ other two be brained like us, the state totters.
3 2237 
3 2238 _Ste._ Drink, servant-monster, when I bid thee: thy eyes
3 2239 are almost set in thy head.
3 2240 
3 2241 _Trin._ Where should they be set else? he were a brave
3 2242 monster indeed, if they were set in his tail.                       10
3 2243 
3 2244 _Ste._ My man-monster hath drowned his tongue in sack:
3 2245 for my part, the sea cannot drown me; I swam, ere I could
3 2246 recover the shore, five-and-thirty leagues off and on. By
3 2247 this light, thou shalt be my lieutenant, monster, or my
3 2248 standard.                                                           15
3 2249 
3 2250 _Trin._ Your lieutenant, if you list; he’s no standard.
3 2251 
3 2252 _Ste._ We’ll not run, Monsieur Monster.
3 2253 
3 2254 _Trin._ Nor go neither; but you’ll lie, like dogs, and
3 2255 yet say nothing neither.
3 2256 
3 2257 _Ste._ Moon-calf, speak once in thy life, if thou beest a           20
3 2258 good moon-calf.
3 2259 
3 2260 _Cal._ How does thy honour? Let me lick thy shoe.
3 2261 I’ll not serve him, he is not valiant.
3 2262 
3 2263 _Trin._ Thou liest, most ignorant monster: I am in case
3 2264 to justle a constable. Why, thou debauched fish, thou, was          25
3 2265 there ever man a coward that hath drunk so much sack as
3 2266 I to-day? Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie, being but half a
3 2267 fish and half a monster?
3 2268 
3 2269 _Cal._ Lo, how he mocks me! wilt thou let him, my lord?
3 2270 
3 2271 _Trin._ ‘Lord,’ quoth he! That a monster should be                  30
3 2272 such a natural!
3 2273 
3 2274 _Cal._ Lo, lo, again! bite him to death, I prithee.
3 2275 
3 2276 _Ste._ Trinculo, keep a good tongue in your head: if you
3 2277 prove a mutineer,--the next tree! The poor monster’s my
3 2278 subject, and he shall not suffer indignity.                         35
3 2279 
3 2280 _Cal._ I thank my noble lord. Wilt thou be pleased to
3 2281 hearken once again to the suit I made to thee?
3 2282 
3 2283 _Ste._ Marry, will I: kneel and repeat it; I will stand,
3 2284 and so shall Trinculo.
3 2285 
3 2286   _Enter ARIEL, invisible._
3 2287 
3 2288 _Cal._ As I told thee before, I am subject to a tyrant, a           40
3 2289 sorcerer, that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island.
3 2290 
3 2291 _Ari._ Thou liest.
3 2292 
3 2293 _Cal._           Thou liest, thou jesting monkey, thou:
3 2294 I would my valiant master would destroy thee!
3 2295 I do not lie.
3 2296 
3 2297 _Ste._ Trinculo, if you trouble him any more in’s tale, by          45
3 2298 this hand, I will supplant some of your teeth.
3 2299 
3 2300 _Trin._ Why, I said nothing.
3 2301 
3 2302 _Ste._ Mum, then, and no more. Proceed.
3 2303 
3 2304 _Cal._ I say, by sorcery he got this isle;
3 2305 From me he got it. If thy greatness will                            50
3 2306 Revenge it on him,--for I know thou darest,
3 2307 But this thing dare not,--
3 2308 
3 2309 _Ste._ That’s most certain.
3 2310 
3 2311 _Cal._ Thou shalt be lord of it, and I’ll serve thee.
3 2312 
3 2313 _Ste._ How now shall this be compassed? Canst thou                  55
3 2314 bring me to the party?
3 2315 
3 2316 _Cal._ Yea, yea, my lord: I’ll yield him thee asleep,
3 2317 Where thou mayst knock a nail into his head.
3 2318 
3 2319 _Ari._ Thou liest; thou canst not.
3 2320 
3 2321 _Cal._ What a pied ninny’s this! Thou scurvy patch!                 60
3 2322 I do beseech thy Greatness, give him blows,
3 2323 And take his bottle from him: when that’s gone,
3 2324 He shall drink nought but brine; for I’ll not show him
3 2325 Where the quick freshes are.
3 2326 
3 2327 _Ste._ Trinculo, run into no further danger: interrupt the          65
3 2328 monster one word further, and, by this hand, I’ll turn my
3 2329 mercy out o’ doors, and make a stock-fish of thee.
3 2330 
3 2331 _Trin._ Why, what did I? I did nothing. I’ll go farther
3 2332 off.
3 2333 
3 2334 _Ste._ Didst thou not say he lied?                                  70
3 2335 
3 2336 _Ari._ Thou liest.
3 2337 
3 2338 _Ste._ Do I so? take thou that. [_Beats him._] As you
3 2339 like this, give me the lie another time.
3 2340 
3 2341 _Trin._ I did not give the lie. Out o’ your wits, and
3 2342 hearing too? A pox o’ your bottle! this can sack and                75
3 2343 drinking do. A murrain on your monster, and the devil
3 2344 take your fingers!
3 2345 
3 2346 _Cal._ Ha, ha, ha!
3 2347 
3 2348 _Ste._ Now, forward with your tale. --Prithee, stand farther
3 2349 off.                                                                80
3 2350 
3 2351 _Cal._ Beat him enough: after a little time,
3 2352 I’ll beat him too.
3 2353 
3 2354 _Ste._ Stand farther. Come, proceed.
3 2355 
3 2356 _Cal._ Why, as I told thee, ’tis a custom with him
3 2357 I’ th’ afternoon to sleep: there thou mayst brain him,
3 2358 Having first seized his books; or with a log                        85
3 2359 Batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,
3 2360 Or cut his wezand with thy knife. Remember
3 2361 First to possess his books; for without them
3 2362 He’s but a sot, as I am, nor hath not
3 2363 One spirit to command: they all do hate him                         90
3 2364 As rootedly as I. Burn but his books.
3 2365 He has brave utensils,--for so he calls them,--
3 2366 Which, when he has a house, he’ll deck withal.
3 2367 And that most deeply to consider is
3 2368 The beauty of his daughter; he himself                              95
3 2369 Calls her a nonpareil: I never saw a woman,
3 2370 But only Sycorax my dam and she;
3 2371 But she as far surpasseth Sycorax
3 2372 As great’st does least.
3 2373 
3 2374 _Ste._                Is it so brave a lass?
3 2375 
3 2376 _Cal._ Ay, lord; she will become thy bed, I warrant,               100
3 2377 And bring thee forth brave brood.
3 2378 
3 2379 _Ste._ Monster, I will kill this man: his daughter and I
3 2380 will be king and queen,--save our Graces!--and Trinculo
3 2381 and thyself shall be viceroys. Dost thou like the plot,
3 2382 Trinculo?                                                          105
3 2383 
3 2384 _Trin._ Excellent.
3 2385 
3 2386 _Ste._ Give me thy hand: I am sorry I beat thee; but,
3 2387 while thou livest, keep a good tongue in thy head.
3 2388 
3 2389 _Cal._ Within this half hour will he be asleep:
3 2390 Wilt thou destroy him then?
3 2391 
3 2392 _Ste._                    Ay, on mine honour.                      110
3 2393 
3 2394 _Ari._ This will I tell my master.
3 2395 
3 2396 _Cal._ Thou makest me merry; I am full of pleasure:
3 2397 Let us be jocund: will you troll the catch
3 2398 You taught me but while-ere?
3 2399 
3 2400 _Ste._ At thy request, monster, I will do reason, any              115
3 2401 reason. --Come on. Trinculo, let us sing.      [_Sings._
3 2402 
3 2403   Flout ’em and scout ’em, and scout ’em and flout ’em;
3 2404   Thought is free.
3 2405 
3 2406 _Cal._ That’s not the tune.
3 2407 
3 2408   [_Ariel plays the tune on a tabor and pipe._
3 2409 
3 2410 _Ste._ What is this same?                                          120
3 2411 
3 2412 _Trin._ This is the tune of our catch, played by the picture
3 2413 of Nobody.
3 2414 
3 2415 _Ste._ If thou beest a man, show thyself in thy likeness:
3 2416 if thou beest a devil, take’t as thou list.
3 2417 
3 2418 _Trin._ O, forgive me my sins!                                     125
3 2419 
3 2420 _Ste._ He that dies pays all debts: I defy thee. Mercy
3 2421 upon us!
3 2422 
3 2423 _Cal._ Art thou afeard?
3 2424 
3 2425 _Ste._ No, monster, not I.
3 2426 
3 2427 _Cal._ Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises,                  130
3 2428 Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight, and hurt not.
3 2429 Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments
3 2430 Will hum about mine ears; and sometime voices,
3 2431 That, if I then had waked after long sleep,
3 2432 Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming,                   135
3 2433 The clouds methought would open, and show riches
3 2434 Ready to drop upon me; that, when I waked,
3 2435 I cried to dream again.
3 2436 
3 2437 _Ste._ This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I
3 2438 shall have my music for nothing.                                   140
3 2439 
3 2440 _Cal._ When Prospero is destroyed.
3 2441 
3 2442 _Ste._ That shall be by and by: I remember the story.
3 2443 
3 2444 _Trin._ The sound is going away; let’s follow it, and
3 2445 after do our work.
3 2446 
3 2447 _Ste._ Lead, monster; we’ll follow. I would I could see            145
3 2448 this taborer; he lays it on.
3 2449 
3 2450 _Trin._ Wilt come? I’ll follow, Stephano.    [_Exeunt._

3 2486   _Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO, ADRIAN, FRANCISCO,
3 2487   and others._
3 2488 
3 2489 _Gon._ By’r lakin, I can go no further, sir;
3 2490 My old bones ache: here’s a maze trod, indeed,
3 2491 Through forth-rights and meanders! By your patience,
3 2492 I needs must rest me.
3 2493 
3 2494 _Alon._             Old lord, I cannot blame thee,
3 2495 Who am myself attach’d with weariness,                               5
3 2496 To the dulling of my spirits: sit down, and rest.
3 2497 Even here I will put off my hope, and keep it
3 2498 No longer for my flatterer: he is drown’d
3 2499 Whom thus we stray to find; and the sea mocks
3 2500 Our frustrate search on land. Well, let him go.                     10
3 2501 
3 2502 _Ant._ [_Aside to Seb._] I am right glad that he’s so out of hope.
3 2503 Do not, for one repulse, forego the purpose
3 2504 That you resolved to effect.
3 2505 
3 2506 _Seb._ [_Aside to Ant._] The next advantage
3 2507 Will we take throughly.
3 2508 
3 2509 _Ant._ [_Aside to Seb._] Let it be to-night;
3 2510 For, now they are oppress’d with travel, they                       15
3 2511 Will not, nor cannot, use such vigilance
3 2512 As when they are fresh.

3 2528 _Seb._ A living drollery. Now I will believe
3 2529 That there are unicorns; that in Arabia
3 2530 There is one tree, the phœnix’ throne; one phœnix
3 2531 At this hour reigning there.
3 2532 
3 2533 _Ant._                     I’ll believe both;
3 2534 And what does else want credit, come to me,                         25
3 2535 And I’ll be sworn ’tis true: travellers ne’er did lie,
3 2536 Though fools at home condemn ’em.
3 2537 
3 2538 _Gon._                          If in Naples
3 2539 I should report this now, would they believe me?
3 2540 If I should say, I saw such islanders,--
3 2541 For, certes, these are people of the island,--                      30
3 2542 Who, though they are of monstrous shape, yet, note,
3 2543 Their manners are more gentle-kind than of
3 2544 Our human generation you shall find
3 2545 Many, nay, almost any.
3 2546 
3 2547 _Pros._              [_Aside_] Honest lord,
3 2548 Thou hast said well; for some of you there present                  35
3 2549 Are worse than devils.
3 2550 
3 2551 _Alon._              I cannot too much muse
3 2552 Such shapes, such gesture, and such sound, expressing--
3 2553 Although they want the use of tongue--a kind
3 2554 Of excellent dumb discourse.
3 2555 
3 2556 _Pros._                    [_Aside_] Praise in departing.
3 2557 
3 2558 _Fran._ They vanish’d strangely.
3 2559 
3 2560 _Seb._                         No matter, since                     40
3 2561 They have left their viands behind; for we have stomachs.--
3 2562 Will’t please you taste of what is here?
3 2563 
3 2564 _Alon._                                Not I.
3 2565 
3 2566 _Gon._ Faith, sir, you need not fear. When we were boys,
3 2567 Who would believe that there were mountaineers
3 2568 Dew-lapp’d like bulls, whose throats had hanging at ’em             45
3 2569 Wallets of flesh? or that there were such men
3 2570 Whose heads stood in their breasts? which now we find
3 2571 Each putter-out of five for one will bring us
3 2572 Good warrant of.
3 2573 
3 2574 _Alon._        I will stand to, and feed,
3 2575 Although my last: no matter, since I feel                           50
3 2576 The best is past. Brother, my lord the duke,
3 2577 Stand to, and do as we.
3 2578 
3 2579   _Thunder and lightning. Enter ARIEL, like a harpy; claps his
3 2580   wings upon the table; and, with a quaint device, the banquet
3 2581   vanishes._
3 2582 
3 2583 _Ari._ You are three men of sin, whom Destiny,--
3 2584 That hath to instrument this lower world
3 2585 And what is in’t,--the never-surfeited sea                          55
3 2586 Hath caused to belch up you; and on this island,
3 2587 Where man doth not inhabit,--you ’mongst men
3 2588 Being most unfit to live. I have made you mad;
3 2589 And even with such-like valour men hang and drown
3 2590 Their proper selves.    [_Alon., Seb. &c. draw their swords._
3 2591                    You fools! I and my fellows                      60
3 2592 Are ministers of Fate: the elements,
3 2593 Of whom your swords are temper’d, may as well
3 2594 Wound the loud winds, or with bemock’d-at stabs
3 2595 Kill the still-closing waters, as diminish
3 2596 One dowle that’s in my plume: my fellow-ministers                   65
3 2597 Are like invulnerable. If you could hurt,
3 2598 Your swords are now too massy for your strengths,
3 2599 And will not be uplifted. But remember,--
3 2600 For that’s my business to you,--that you three
3 2601 From Milan did supplant good Prospero;                              70
3 2602 Exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it,
3 2603 Him and his innocent child: for which foul deed
3 2604 The powers, delaying, not forgetting, have
3 2605 Incensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures,
3 2606 Against your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso,                        75
3 2607 They have bereft; and do pronounce by me:
3 2608 Lingering perdition--worse than any death
3 2609 Can be at once--shall step by step attend
3 2610 You and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from,--
3 2611 Which here, in this most desolate isle, else falls                  80
3 2612 Upon your heads,--is nothing but heart-sorrow
3 2613 And a clear life ensuing.
3 2614 
3 2615   _He vanishes in thunder; then, to soft music, enter the Shapes
3 2616   again, and dance, with mocks and mows, and carrying out the
3 2617   table._
3 2618 
3 2619 _Pros._ Bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou
3 2620 Perform’d, my Ariel; a grace it had, devouring:
3 2621 Of my instruction hast thou nothing bated                           85
3 2622 In what thou hadst to say: so, with good life
3 2623 And observation strange, my meaner ministers
3 2624 Their several kinds have done. My high charms work,
3 2625 And these mine enemies are all knit up
3 2626 In their distractions: they now are in my power;                    90
3 2627 And in these fits I leave them, while I visit
3 2628 Young Ferdinand,--whom they suppose is drown’d,--
3 2629 And his and mine loved darling.    [_Exit above._
3 2630 
3 2631 _Gon._ I’ the name of something holy, sir, why stand you
3 2632 In this strange stare?
3 2633 
3 2634 _Alon._              O, it is monstrous, monstrous!                 95
3 2635 Methought the billows spoke, and told me of it;
3 2636 The winds did sing it to me; and the thunder,
3 2637 That deep and dreadful organ-pipe, pronounced
3 2638 The name of Prosper: it did bass my trespass.
3 2639 Therefore my son i’ th’ ooze is bedded; and                        100
3 2640 I’ll seek him deeper than e’er plummet sounded,
3 2641 And with him there lie mudded.    [_Exit._
3 2642 
3 2643 _Seb._                       But one fiend at a time,
3 2644 I’ll fight their legions o’er.
3 2645 
3 2646 _Ant._                       I’ll be thy second.
3 2647 
3 2648     [_Exeunt Seb. and Ant._
3 2649 
3 2650 _Gon._ All three of them are desperate: their great guilt,
3 2651 Like poison given to work a great time after,                      105
3 2652 Now ’gins to bite the spirits. I do beseech you,
3 2653 That are of suppler joints, follow them swiftly,
3 2654 And hinder them from what this ecstasy
3 2655 May now provoke them to.
3 2656 
3 2657 _Adr._                 Follow, I pray you.    [_Exeunt._

3 2700 
3 2701 
3 2702 SCENE I. _Before PROSPERO’S cell._
3 2703 
3 2704   _Enter PROSPERO, FERDINAND, and MIRANDA._
3 2705 
3 2706 _Pros._ If I have too austerely punish’d you,
3 2707 Your compensation makes amends; for I
3 2708 Have given you here a third of mine own life,
3 2709 Or that for which I live; who once again
3 2710 I tender to thy hand: all thy vexations                              5
3 2711 Were but my trials of thy love, and thou
3 2712 Hast strangely stood the test: here, afore Heaven,
3 2713 I ratify this my rich gift. O Ferdinand,
3 2714 Do not smile at me that I boast her off,
3 2715 For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise,                   10
3 2716 And make it halt behind her.
3 2717 
3 2718 _Fer._                     I do believe it
3 2719 Against an oracle.
3 2720 
3 2721 _Pros._          Then, as my gift, and thine own acquisition
3 2722 Worthily purchased, take my daughter: but
3 2723 If thou dost break her virgin-knot before                           15
3 2724 All sanctimonious ceremonies may
3 2725 With full and holy rite be minister’d,
3 2726 No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall
3 2727 To make this contract grow; but barren hate,
3 2728 Sour-eyed disdain and discord shall bestrew                         20
3 2729 The union of your bed with weeds so loathly
3 2730 That you shall hate it both: therefore take heed,
3 2731 As Hymen’s lamps shall light you.
3 2732 
3 2733 _Fer._                          As I hope
3 2734 For quiet days, fair issue and long life,
3 2735 With such love as ’tis now, the murkiest den,                       25
3 2736 The most opportune place, the strong’st suggestion
3 2737 Our worser Genius can, shall never melt
3 2738 Mine honour into lust, to take away
3 2739 The edge of that day’s celebration
3 2740 When I shall think, or Phœbus’ steeds are founder’d,                30
3 2741 Or Night kept chain’d below.
3 2742 
3 2743 _Pros._                    Fairly spoke.
3 2744 Sit, then, and talk with her; she is thine own.
3 2745 What, Ariel! my industrious servant, Ariel!
3 2746 
3 2747   _Enter ARIEL._
3 2748 
3 2749 _Ari._ What would my potent master? here I am.
3 2750 
3 2751 _Pros._ Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service               35
3 2752 Did worthily perform; and I must use you
3 2753 In such another trick. Go bring the rabble,
3 2754 O’er whom I give thee power, here to this place:
3 2755 Incite them to quick motion; for I must
3 2756 Bestow upon the eyes of this young couple                           40
3 2757 Some vanity of mine art: it is my promise,
3 2758 And they expect it from me.
3 2759 
3 2760 _Ari._                    Presently?
3 2761 
3 2762 _Pros._ Ay, with a twink.
3 2763 
3 2764 _Ari._ Before you can say, ‘come,’ and ‘go,’
3 2765             And breathe twice, and cry, ‘so, so,’                   45
3 2766             Each one, tripping on his toe,
3 2767             Will be here with mop and mow.
3 2768             Do you love me, master? no?
3 2769 
3 2770 _Pros._ Dearly, my delicate Ariel. Do not approach
3 2771 Till thou dost hear me call.
3 2772 
3 2773 _Ari._                     Well, I conceive.    [_Exit._            50
3 2774 
3 2775 _Pros._ Look thou be true; do not give dalliance
3 2776 Too much the rein: the strongest oaths are straw
3 2777 To the fire i’ the blood: be more abstemious,
3 2778 Or else, good night your vow!
3 2779 
3 2780 _Fer._                      I warrant you, sir;
3 2781 The white cold virgin snow upon my heart                            55
3 2782 Abates the ardour of my liver.
3 2783 
3 2784 _Pros._                      Well.
3 2785 Now come, my Ariel! bring a corollary,
3 2786 Rather than want a spirit: appear, and pertly!
3 2787 No tongue! all eyes! be silent.                  [_Soft music._
3 2788 
3 2789     _Enter IRIS._
3 2790 
3 2791   _Iris._ Ceres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas                 60
3 2792     Of wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats, and pease;
3 2793     Thy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep,
3 2794     And flat meads thatch’d with stover, them to keep;
3 2795     Thy banks with pioned and twilled brims,
3 2796     Which spongy April at thy best betrims,                         65
3 2797     To make cold nymphs chaste crowns; and thy broom-groves,
3 2798     Whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves,
3 2799     Being lass-lorn; thy pole-clipt vineyard;
3 2800     And thy sea-marge, sterile and rocky-hard,
3 2801     Where thou thyself dost air;--the queen o’ the sky,             70
3 2802     Whose watery arch and messenger am I,
3 2803     Bids thee leave these; and with her sovereign grace,
3 2804     Here on this grass-plot, in this very place,
3 2805     To come and sport:--her peacocks fly amain:
3 2806     Approach, rich Ceres, her to entertain.                         75
3 2807 
3 2808     _Enter CERES._
3 2809 
3 2810   _Cer._ Hail, many-colour’d messenger, that ne’er
3 2811     Dost disobey the wife of Jupiter;
3 2812     Who, with thy saffron wings, upon my flowers
3 2813     Diffusest honey-drops, refreshing showers;
3 2814     And with each end of thy blue bow dost crown                    80
3 2815     My bosky acres and my unshrubb’d down,
3 2816     Rich scarf to my proud earth;--why hath thy queen
3 2817     Summon’d me hither, to this short-grass’d green?
3 2818 
3 2819   _Iris._ A contract of true love to celebrate;
3 2820     And some donation freely to estate                              85
3 2821     On the blest lovers.
3 2822 
3 2823   _Cer._             Tell me, heavenly bow,
3 2824     If Venus or her son, as thou dost know,
3 2825     Do now attend the queen? Since they did plot
3 2826     The means that dusky Dis my daughter got,
3 2827     Her and her blind boy’s scandal’d company                       90
3 2828     I have forsworn.
3 2829 
3 2830   _Iris._        Of her society
3 2831     Be not afraid: I met her Deity
3 2832     Cutting the clouds towards Paphos, and her son
3 2833     Dove-drawn with her. Here thought they to have done
3 2834     Some wanton charm upon this man and maid,                       95
3 2835     Whose vows are, that no bed-right shall be paid
3 2836     Till Hymen’s torch be lighted: but in vain;
3 2837     Mars’s hot minion is returned again;
3 2838     Her waspish-headed son has broke his arrows,
3 2839     Swears he will shoot no more, but play with sparrows,          100
3 2840     And be a boy right out.
3 2841 
3 2842   _Cer._                High’st queen of state,
3 2843     Great Juno, comes; I know her by her gait.
3 2844 
3 2845     _Enter JUNO._
3 2846 
3 2847   _Juno._ How does my bounteous sister? Go with me
3 2848     To bless this twain, that they may prosperous be,
3 2849     And honour’d in their issue.         [_They sing:_             105
3 2850 
3 2851   _Juno._ Honour, riches, marriage-blessing,
3 2852             Long continuance, and increasing,
3 2853             Hourly joys be still upon you!
3 2854             Juno sings her blessings on you.
3 2855 
3 2856   _Cer._  Earth’s increase, foison plenty,                         110
3 2857             Barns and garners never empty;
3 2858             Vines with clustering bunches growing;
3 2859             Plants with goodly burthen bowing;
3 2860             Spring come to you at the farthest
3 2861             In the very end of harvest!                            115
3 2862             Scarcity and want shall shun you;
3 2863             Ceres’ blessing so is on you.
3 2864 
3 2865 _Fer._ This is a most majestic vision, and
3 2866 Harmonious charmingly. May I be bold
3 2867 To think these spirits?
3 2868 
3 2869 _Pros._               Spirits, which by mine art                   120
3 2870 I have from their confines call’d to enact
3 2871 My present fancies.
3 2872 
3 2873 _Fer._            Let me live here ever;
3 2874 So rare a wonder’d father and a wife
3 2875 Makes this place Paradise.
3 2876 
3 2877     [_Juno and Ceres whisper, and send Iris on employment._
3 2878 
3 2879 _Pros._                  Sweet, now, silence!
3 2880 Juno and Ceres whisper seriously;                                  125
3 2881 There’s something else to do: hush, and be mute,
3 2882 Or else our spell is marr’d.
3 2883 
3 2884   _Iris._ You nymphs, call’d Naiads, of the windring brooks,
3 2885             With your sedged crowns and ever-harmless looks,
3 2886             Leave your crisp channels, and on this green land      130
3 2887             Answer your summons; Juno does command:
3 2888             Come, temperate nymphs, and help to celebrate
3 2889             A contract of true love; be not too late.
3 2890 
3 2891     _Enter certain Nymphs._
3 2892 
3 2893             You sunburnt sicklemen, of August weary,
3 2894             Come hither from the furrow, and be merry:             135
3 2895             Make holiday; your rye-straw hats put on,
3 2896             And these fresh nymphs encounter every one
3 2897             In country footing.
3 2898 
3 2899     _Enter certain Reapers, properly habited: they join with the
3 2900     Nymphs in a graceful dance; towards the end whereof PROSPERO
3 2901     starts suddenly, and speaks; after which, to a strange, hollow,
3 2902     and confused noise, they heavily vanish._
3 2903 
3 2904 _Pros._ [_Aside_] I had forgot that foul conspiracy
3 2905 Of the beast Caliban and his confederates                          140
3 2906 Against my life: the minute of their plot
3 2907 Is almost come. [_To the Spirits._] Well done! avoid; no more!
3 2908 
3 2909 _Fer._ This is strange: your father’s in some passion
3 2910 That works him strongly.
3 2911 
3 2912 _Mir._                 Never till this day
3 2913 Saw I him touch’d with anger so distemper’d.                       145
3 2914 
3 2915 _Pros._ You do look, my son, in a moved sort,
3 2916 As if you were dismay’d: be cheerful, sir.
3 2917 Our revels now are ended. These our actors,
3 2918 As I foretold you, were all spirits, and
3 2919 Are melted into air, into thin air:                                150
3 2920 And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,
3 2921 The cloud-capp’d towers, the gorgeous palaces,
3 2922 The solemn temples, the great globe itself,
3 2923 Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve,
3 2924 And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,                        155
3 2925 Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff
3 2926 As dreams are made on; and our little life
3 2927 Is rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vex’d;
3 2928 Bear with my weakness; my old brain is troubled:
3 2929 Be not disturb’d with my infirmity:                                160
3 2930 If you be pleased, retire into my cell,
3 2931 And there repose: a turn or two I’ll walk,
3 2932 To still my beating mind.
3 2933 
3 2934 _Fer._ _Mir._           We wish your peace.    [_Exeunt._
3 2935 
3 2936 _Pros._ Come with a thought. I thank thee, Ariel: come.
3 2937 
3 2938   _Enter ARIEL._
3 2939 
3 2940 _Ari._ Thy thoughts I cleave to. What’s thy pleasure?              165
3 2941 
3 2942 _Pros._                                             Spirit,
3 2943 We must prepare to meet with Caliban.
3 2944 
3 2945 _Ari._ Ay, my commander: when I presented Ceres,
3 2946 I thought to have told thee of it; but I fear’d
3 2947 Lest I might anger thee.
3 2948 
3 2949 _Pros._ Say again, where didst thou leave these varlets?           170
3 2950 
3 2951 _Ari._ I told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking;
3 2952 So full of valour that they smote the air
3 2953 For breathing in their faces; beat the ground
3 2954 For kissing of their feet; yet always bending
3 2955 Towards their project. Then I beat my tabor;                       175
3 2956 At which, like unback’d colts, they prick’d their ears,
3 2957 Advanced their eyelids, lifted up their noses
3 2958 As they smelt music: so I charm’d their ears,
3 2959 That, calf-like, they my lowing follow’d through
3 2960 Tooth’d briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss, and thorns,           180
3 2961 Which enter’d their frail shins: at last I left them
3 2962 I’ the filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell,
3 2963 There dancing up to the chins, that the foul lake
3 2964 O’erstunk their feet.
3 2965 
3 2966 _Pros._             This was well done, my bird.
3 2967 Thy shape invisible retain thou still:                             185
3 2968 The trumpery in my house, go bring it hither,
3 2969 For stale to catch these thieves.
3 2970 
3 2971 _Ari._                          I go, I go.    [_Exit._
3 2972 
3 2973 _Pros._ A devil, a born devil, on whose nature
3 2974 Nurture can never stick; on whom my pains,
3 2975 Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost;                         190
3 2976 And as with age his body uglier grows,
3 2977 So his mind cankers. I will plague them all,
3 2978 Even to roaring.
3 2979 
3 2980   _Re-enter ARIEL, loaden with glistering apparel, &c._
3 2981 
3 2982 Come, hang them on this line.
3 2983 
3 2984   _PROSPERO and ARIEL remain, invisible. Enter CALIBAN, STEPHANO,
3 2985   and TRINCULO, all wet._
3 2986 
3 2987 _Cal._ Pray you, tread softly, that the blind mole may not
3 2988 Hear a foot fall: we now are near his cell.                        195
3 2989 
3 2990 _Ste._ Monster, your fairy, which you say is a harmless
3 2991 fairy, has done little better than played the Jack with us.
3 2992 
3 2993 _Trin._ Monster, I do smell all horse-piss; at which my
3 2994 nose is in great indignation.
3 2995 
3 2996 _Ste._ So is mine. Do you hear, monster? If I should               200
3 2997 take a displeasure against you, look you,--
3 2998 
3 2999 _Trin._ Thou wert but a lost monster.
3 3000 
3 3001 _Cal._ Good my lord, give me thy favour still.
3 3002 Be patient, for the prize I’ll bring thee to
3 3003 Shall hoodwink this mischance: therefore speak softly.             205
3 3004 All’s hush’d as midnight yet.
3 3005 
3 3006 _Trin._ Ay, but to lose our bottles in the pool,--
3 3007 
3 3008 _Ste._ There is not only disgrace and dishonour in that,
3 3009 monster, but an infinite loss.
3 3010 
3 3011 _Trin._ That’s more to me than my wetting: yet this is             210
3 3012 your harmless fairy, monster.
3 3013 
3 3014 _Ste._ I will fetch off my bottle, though I be o’er ears for
3 3015 my labour.
3 3016 
3 3017 _Cal._ Prithee, my king, be quiet. See’st thou here,
3 3018 This is the mouth o’ the cell: no noise, and enter.                215
3 3019 Do that good mischief which may make this island
3 3020 Thine own for ever, and I, thy Caliban,
3 3021 For aye thy foot-licker.
3 3022 
3 3023 _Ste._ Give me thy hand. I do begin to have bloody
3 3024 thoughts.                                                          220
3 3025 
3 3026 _Trin._ O King Stephano! O peer! O worthy Stephano!
3 3027 look what a wardrobe here is for thee!
3 3028 
3 3029 _Cal._ Let it alone, thou fool; it is but trash.
3 3030 
3 3031 _Trin._ O, ho, monster! we know what belongs to a frippery.
3 3032 O King Stephano!                                                   225
3 3033 
3 3034 _Ste._ Put off that gown, Trinculo; by this hand, I’ll
3 3035 have that gown.
3 3036 
3 3037 _Trin._ Thy Grace shall have it.
3 3038 
3 3039 _Cal._ The dropsy drown this fool! what do you mean
3 3040 To dote thus on such luggage? Let’s alone,                         230
3 3041 And do the murder first: if he awake,
3 3042 From toe to crown he’ll fill our skins with pinches,
3 3043 Make us strange stuff.
3 3044 
3 3045 _Ste._ Be you quiet, monster. Mistress line, is not this
3 3046 my jerkin? Now is the jerkin under the line: now, jerkin,          235
3 3047 you are like to lose your hair, and prove a bald jerkin.
3 3048 
3 3049 _Trin._ Do, do: we steal by line and level, an’t like your
3 3050 Grace.
3 3051 
3 3052 _Ste._ I thank thee for that jest; here’s a garment for’t:
3 3053 wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king of this country.       240
3 3054 ‘Steal by line and level’ is an excellent pass of pate;
3 3055 there’s another garment for’t.
3 3056 
3 3057 _Trin._ Monster, come, put some lime upon your fingers,
3 3058 and away with the rest.
3 3059 
3 3060 _Cal._ I will have none on’t: we shall lose our time,              245
3 3061 And all be turn’d to barnacles, or to apes
3 3062 With foreheads villanous low.
3 3063 
3 3064 _Ste._ Monster, lay-to your fingers: help to bear this
3 3065 away where my hogshead of wine is, or I’ll turn you out
3 3066 of my kingdom: go to, carry this.                                  250
3 3067 
3 3068 _Trin._ And this.
3 3069 
3 3070 _Ste._ Ay, and this.
3 3071 
3 3072   _A noise of hunters heard. Enter divers Spirits, in shape of
3 3073   dogs and hounds, and hunt them about, PROSPERO and ARIEL setting
3 3074   them on._
3 3075 
3 3076 _Pros._ Hey, Mountain, hey!
3 3077 
3 3078 _Ari._ Silver! there it goes, Silver!
3 3079 
3 3080 _Pros._ Fury, fury! there, Tyrant, there! hark, hark!              255
3 3081                         [_Cal., Ste., and Trin. are driven out._
3 3082 
3 3083 Go charge my goblins that they grind their joints
3 3084 With dry convulsions; shorten up their sinews
3 3085 With aged cramps; and more pinch-spotted make them
3 3086 Then pard or cat o’ mountain.
3 3087 
3 3088 _Ari._                      Hark, they roar!
3 3089 
3 3090 _Pros._ Let them be hunted soundly. At this hour                   260
3 3091 Lie at my mercy all mine enemies:
3 3092 Shortly shall all my labours end, and thou
3 3093 Shalt have the air at freedom: for a little
3 3094 Follow, and do me service.    [_Exeunt._

3 3173 
3 3174 SCENE I. _Before the cell of Prospero._
3 3175 
3 3176   _Enter PROSPERO in his magic robes, and ARIEL._
3 3177 
3 3178 _Pros._ Now does my project gather to a head:
3 3179 My charms crack not; my spirits obey; and time
3 3180 Goes upright with his carriage. How’s the day?
3 3181 
3 3182 _Ari._ On the sixth hour; at which time, my lord,
3 3183 You said our work should cease.
3 3184 
3 3185 _Pros._                       I did say so,                          5
3 3186 When first I raised the tempest. Say, my spirit,
3 3187 How fares the king and’s followers?
3 3188 
3 3189 _Ari._                            Confined together
3 3190 In the same fashion as you gave in charge,
3 3191 Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir,
3 3192 In the line-grove which weather-fends your cell;                    10
3 3193 They cannot budge till your release. The king,
3 3194 His brother, and yours, abide all three distracted,
3 3195 And the remainder mourning over them,
3 3196 Brimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly
3 3197 Him that you term’d, sir, “The good old lord, Gonzalo;”             15
3 3198 His tears run down his beard, like winter’s drops
3 3199 From eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works ’em,
3 3200 That if you now beheld them, your affections
3 3201 Would become tender.
3 3202 
3 3203 _Pros._            Dost thou think so, spirit?
3 3204 
3 3205 _Ari._ Mine would, sir, were I human.
3 3206 
3 3207 _Pros._                             And mine shall.                 20
3 3208 Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling
3 3209 Of their afflictions, and shall not myself,
3 3210 One of their kind, that relish all as sharply,
3 3211 Passion as they, be kindlier moved than thou art?
3 3212 Though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick,             25
3 3213 Yet with my nobler reason ’gainst my fury
3 3214 Do I take part: the rarer action is
3 3215 In virtue than in vengeance: they being penitent,
3 3216 The sole drift of my purpose doth extend
3 3217 Not a frown further. Go release them, Ariel:                        30
3 3218 My charms I’ll break, their senses I’ll restore,
3 3219 And they shall be themselves.
3 3220 
3 3221 _Ari._                      I’ll fetch them, sir.    [_Exit._
3 3222 
3 3223 _Pros._ Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes, and groves;
3 3224 And ye that on the sands with printless foot
3 3225 Do chase the ebbing Neptune, and do fly him                         35
3 3226 When he comes back; you demi-puppets that
3 3227 By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,
3 3228 Whereof the ewe not bites; and you whose pastime
3 3229 Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice
3 3230 To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid--                           40
3 3231 Weak masters though ye be--I have bedimm’d
3 3232 The noontide sun, call’d forth the mutinous winds.
3 3233 And ’twixt the green sea and the azured vault
3 3234 Set roaring war: to the dread rattling thunder
3 3235 Have I given fire, and rifted Jove’s stout oak                      45
3 3236 With his own bolt; the strong-based promontory
3 3237 Have I made shake, and by the spurs pluck’d up
3 3238 The pine and cedar: graves at my command
3 3239 Have waked their sleepers, oped, and let ’em forth
3 3240 By my so potent art. But this rough magic                           50
3 3241 I here abjure; and, when I have required
3 3242 Some heavenly music,--which even now I do,--
3 3243 To work mine end upon their senses, that
3 3244 This airy charm is for, I’ll break my staff,
3 3245 Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,                               55
3 3246 And deeper than did ever plummet sound
3 3247 I’ll drown my book.                    [_Solemn music._
3 3248 
3 3249   _Re-enter ARIEL before: then ALONSO, with a frantic gesture,
3 3250   attended by GONZALO; SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO in like manner,
3 3251   attended by ADRIAN and FRANCISCO: they all enter the circle
3 3252   which PROSPERO had made, and there stand charmed; which PROSPERO
3 3253   observing, speaks:_
3 3254 
3 3255 A solemn air, and the best comforter
3 3256 To an unsettled fancy, cure thy brains,
3 3257 Now useless, boil’d within thy skull! There stand,                  60
3 3258 For you are spell-stopp’d.
3 3259 Holy Gonzalo, honourable man,
3 3260 Mine eyes, even sociable to the show of thine,
3 3261 Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace;
3 3262 And as the morning steals upon the night,                           65
3 3263 Melting the darkness, so their rising senses
3 3264 Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle
3 3265 Their clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,
3 3266 My true preserver, and a loyal sir
3 3267 To him thou follow’st! I will pay thy graces                        70
3 3268 Home both in word and deed. Most cruelly
3 3269 Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter:
3 3270 Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.
3 3271 Thou art pinch’d for’t now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood,
3 3272 You, brother mine, that entertain’d ambition,                       75
3 3273 Expell’d remorse and nature; who, with Sebastian,--
3 3274 Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong,--
3 3275 Would here have kill’d your king; I do forgive thee,
3 3276 Unnatural though thou art. Their understanding
3 3277 Begins to swell; and the approaching tide                           80
3 3278 Will shortly fill the reasonable shore,
3 3279 That now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them
3 3280 That yet looks on me, or would know me: Ariel,
3 3281 Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell:
3 3282 I will discase me, and myself present                               85
3 3283 As I was sometime Milan: quickly, spirit;
3 3284 Thou shalt ere long be free.
3 3285 
3 3286 _ARIEL sings and helps to attire him._
3 3287 
3 3288     Where the bee sucks, there suck I:
3 3289     In a cowslip’s bell I lie;
3 3290     There I couch when owls do cry.                                 90
3 3291     On the bat’s back I do fly
3 3292     After summer merrily.
3 3293 Merrily, merrily shall I live now
3 3294 Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.
3 3295 
3 3296 _Pros._ Why, that’s my dainty Ariel! I shall miss thee;             95
3 3297 But yet thou shalt have freedom: so, so, so.
3 3298 To the king’s ship, invisible as thou art:
3 3299 There shalt thou find the mariners asleep
3 3300 Under the hatches; the master and the boatswain
3 3301 Being awake, enforce them to this place,                           100
3 3302 And presently, I prithee.
3 3303 
3 3304 _Ari._ I drink the air before me, and return
3 3305 Or ere your pulse twice beat.    [_Exit._
3 3306 
3 3307 _Gon._ All torment, trouble, wonder and amazement
3 3308 Inhabits here: some heavenly power guide us                        105
3 3309 Out of this fearful country!
3 3310 
3 3311 _Pros._                    Behold, sir king,
3 3312 The wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero:
3 3313 For more assurance that a living prince
3 3314 Does now speak to thee, I embrace thy body;
3 3315 And to thee and thy company I bid                                  110
3 3316 A hearty welcome.
3 3317 
3 3318 _Alon._         Whether thou be’st he or no,
3 3319 Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me,
3 3320 As late I have been, I not know: thy pulse
3 3321 Beats, as of flesh and blood; and, since I saw thee,
3 3322 The affliction of my mind amends, with which,                      115
3 3323 I fear, a madness held me: this must crave--
3 3324 An if this be at all--a most strange story.
3 3325 Thy dukedom I resign, and do entreat
3 3326 Thou pardon me my wrongs. --But how should Prospero
3 3327 Be living and be here?
3 3328 
3 3329 _Pros._              First, noble friend,                          120
3 3330 Let me embrace thine age, whose honour cannot
3 3331 Be measured or confined.
3 3332 
3 3333 _Gon._                 Whether this be
3 3334 Or be not, I’ll not swear.
3 3335 
3 3336 _Pros._                  You do yet taste
3 3337 Some subtilties o’ the isle, that will not let you
3 3338 Believe things certain. Welcome, my friends all!                   125
3 3339 [_Aside to Seb. and Ant._]
3 3340     But you, my brace of lords, were I so minded,
3 3341 I here could pluck his Highness’ frown upon you,
3 3342 And justify you traitors: at this time
3 3343 I will tell no tales.
3 3344 
3 3345 _Seb._ [_Aside_]    The devil speaks in him.
3 3346 
3 3347 _Pros._                                    No.
3 3348 For you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother                     130
3 3349 Would even infect my mouth, I do forgive
3 3350 Thy rankest fault,--all of them; and require
3 3351 My dukedom of thee, which perforce, I know,
3 3352 Thou must restore.
3 3353 
3 3354 _Alon._          If thou be’st Prospero,
3 3355 Give us particulars of thy preservation;                           135
3 3356 How thou hast met us here, who three hours since
3 3357 Were wreck’d upon this shore; where I have lost--
3 3358 How sharp the point of this remembrance is!--
3 3359 My dear son Ferdinand.
3 3360 
3 3361 _Pros._              I am woe for’t, sir.
3 3362 
3 3363 _Alon._ Irreparable is the loss; and patience                      140
3 3364 Says it is past her cure.
3 3365 
3 3366 _Pros._                 I rather think
3 3367 You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace
3 3368 For the like loss I have her sovereign aid,
3 3369 And rest myself content.
3 3370 
3 3371 _Alon._                You the like loss!
3 3372 
3 3373 _Pros._ As great to me as late; and, supportable                   145
3 3374 To make the dear loss, have I means much weaker
3 3375 Than you may call to comfort you, for I
3 3376 Have lost my daughter.
3 3377 
3 3378 _Alon._              A daughter?
3 3379 O heavens, that they were living both in Naples,
3 3380 The king and queen there! that they were, I wish                   150
3 3381 Myself were mudded in that oozy bed
3 3382 Where my son lies. When did you lose you daughter?
3 3383 
3 3384 _Pros._ In this last tempest. I perceive, these lords
3 3385 At this encounter do so much admire,
3 3386 That they devour their reason, and scarce think                    155
3 3387 Their eyes do offices of truth, their words
3 3388 Are natural breath: but, howsoe’er you have
3 3389 Been justled from your senses, know for certain
3 3390 That I am Prospero, and that very duke
3 3391 Which was thrust forth of Milan; who most strangely                160
3 3392 Upon this shore, where you were wreck’d, was landed,
3 3393 To be the Lord on’t. No more yet of this;
3 3394 For ’tis a chronicle of day by day,
3 3395 Not a relation for a breakfast, nor
3 3396 Befitting this first meeting. Welcome, sir;                        165
3 3397 This cell’s my court: here have I few attendants,
3 3398 And subjects none abroad: pray you, look in.
3 3399 My dukedom since you have given me again,
3 3400 I will requite you with as good a thing;
3 3401 At least bring forth a wonder, to content ye                       170
3 3402 As much as me my dukedom.
3 3403 
3 3404   _Here Prospero discovers FERDINAND and MIRANDA playing at chess._
3 3405 
3 3406 _Mir._ Sweet lord, you play me false.
3 3407 
3 3408 _Fer._                              No, my dear’st love,
3 3409 I would not for the world.
3 3410 
3 3411 _Mir._ Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle,
3 3412 And I would call it fair play.
3 3413 
3 3414 _Alon._                      If this prove                         175
3 3415 A vision of the island, one dear son
3 3416 Shall I twice lose.
3 3417 
3 3418 _Seb._            A most high miracle!
3 3419 
3 3420 _Fer._ Though the seas threaten, they are merciful;
3 3421 I have cursed them without cause.               [_Kneels._
3 3422 
3 3423 _Alon._                          Now all the blessings
3 3424 Of a glad father compass thee about!                               180
3 3425 Arise, and say how thou camest here.
3 3426 
3 3427 _Mir._                             O, wonder!
3 3428 How many goodly creatures are there here!
3 3429 How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world,
3 3430 That has such people in’t!
3 3431 
3 3432 _Pros._                  ’Tis new to thee.
3 3433 
3 3434 _Alon._ What is this maid with whom thou wast at play?             185
3 3435 Your eld’st acquaintance cannot be three hours:
3 3436 Is she the goddess that hath sever’d us,
3 3437 And brought us thus together?
3 3438 
3 3439 _Fer._                      Sir, she is mortal;
3 3440 But by immortal Providence she’s mine:
3 3441 I chose her when I could not ask my father                         190
3 3442 For his advice, nor thought I had one. She
3 3443 Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan,
3 3444 Of whom so often I have heard renown,
3 3445 But never saw before; of whom I have
3 3446 Received a second life; and second father                          195
3 3447 This lady makes him to me.
3 3448 
3 3449 _Alon._                  I am hers:
3 3450 But, O, how oddly will it sound that I
3 3451 Must ask my child forgiveness!
3 3452 
3 3453 _Pros._                      There, sir, stop:
3 3454 Let us not burthen our remembrances with
3 3455 A heaviness that’s gone.
3 3456 
3 3457 _Gon._                 I have inly wept,                           200
3 3458 Or should have spoke ere this. Look down, you gods,
3 3459 And on this couple drop a blessed crown!
3 3460 For it is you that have chalk’d forth the way
3 3461 Which brought us hither.
3 3462 
3 3463 _Alon._                I say, Amen, Gonzalo!
3 3464 
3 3465 _Gon._ Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue                 205
3 3466 Should become kings of Naples? O, rejoice
3 3467 Beyond a common joy! and set it down
3 3468 With gold on lasting pillars: In one voyage
3 3469 Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis,
3 3470 And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife                           210
3 3471 Where he himself was lost, Prospero his dukedom
3 3472 In a poor isle, and all of us ourselves
3 3473 When no man was his own.
3 3474 
3 3475 _Alon._ [_to Fer. and Mir._] Give me your hands:
3 3476 Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart
3 3477 That doth not wish you joy!
3 3478 
3 3479 _Gon._                    Be it so! Amen!                          215
3 3480 
3 3481   _Re-enter ARIEL, with the _Master_ and _Boatswain_ amazedly
3 3482   following._
3 3483 
3 3484 O, look, sir, look, sir! here is more of us:
3 3485 I prophesied, if a gallows were on land,
3 3486 This fellow could not drown. Now, blasphemy,
3 3487 That swear’st grace o’erboard, not an oath on shore?
3 3488 Hast thou no mouth by land? What is the news?                      220
3 3489 
3 3490 _Boats._ The best news is, that we have safely found
3 3491 Our king and company; the next, our ship--
3 3492 Which, but three glasses since, we gave out split--
3 3493 Is tight and yare and bravely rigg’d, as when
3 3494 We first put out to sea.
3 3495 
3 3496 _Ari._ [_Aside to Pros._] Sir, all this service                    225
3 3497 Have I done since I went.
3 3498 
3 3499 _Pros._ [_Aside to Ari._] My tricksy spirit!
3 3500 
3 3501 _Alon._ These are not natural events; they strengthen
3 3502 From strange to stranger. Say, how came you hither?
3 3503 
3 3504 _Boats._ If I did think, sir, I were well awake,
3 3505 I’ld strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep,                    230
3 3506 And--how we know not--all clapp’d under hatches;
3 3507 Where, but even now, with strange and several noises
3 3508 Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,
3 3509 And more diversity of sounds, all horrible,
3 3510 We were awaked; straightway, at liberty;                           235
3 3511 Where we, in all her trim, freshly beheld
3 3512 Our royal, good, and gallant ship; our master
3 3513 Capering to eye her:--on a trice, so please you,
3 3514 Even in a dream, were we divided from them,
3 3515 And were brought moping hither.
3 3516 
3 3517 _Ari._ [_Aside to Pros._] Was’t well done?                         240
3 3518 
3 3519 _Pros._ [_Aside to Ari._] Bravely, my diligence. Thou shalt be free.
3 3520 
3 3521 _Alon._ This is as strange a maze as e’er men trod;
3 3522 And there is in this business more than nature
3 3523 Was ever conduct of: some oracle
3 3524 Must rectify our knowledge.
3 3525 
3 3526 _Pros._                   Sir, my liege,                           245
3 3527 Do not infest your mind with beating on
3 3528 The strangeness of this business; at pick’d leisure
3 3529 Which shall be shortly, single I’ll resolve you,
3 3530 Which to you shall seem probable, of every
3 3531 These happen’d accidents; till when, be cheerful,                  250
3 3532 And think of each thing well.
3 3533     [_Aside to Ari._] Come hither, spirit:
3 3534 Set Caliban and his companions free;
3 3535 Untie the spell. [_Exit Ariel._] How fares my gracious sir?
3 3536 There are yet missing of your company
3 3537 Some few odd lads that you remember not.                           255
3 3538 
3 3539   _Re-enter ARIEL, driving in CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO,
3 3540   in their stolen apparel._
3 3541 
3 3542 _Ste._ Every man shift for all the rest, and let no man
3 3543 take care for himself; for all is but fortune. --Coragio,
3 3544 bully-monster, coragio!
3 3545 
3 3546 _Trin._ If these be true spies which I wear in my head,
3 3547 here’s a goodly sight.                                             260
3 3548 
3 3549 _Cal._ O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed!
3 3550 How fine my master is! I am afraid
3 3551 He will chastise me.
3 3552 
3 3553 _Seb._             Ha, ha!
3 3554 What things are these, my lord Antonio?
3 3555 Will money buy ’em?
3 3556 
3 3557 _Ant._            Very like; one of them                           265
3 3558 Is a plain fish, and, no doubt, marketable.
3 3559 
3 3560 _Pros._ Mark but the badges of these men, my lords,
3 3561 Then say if they be true. This mis-shapen knave,
3 3562 His mother was a witch; and one so strong
3 3563 That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs,                  270
3 3564 And deal in her command, without her power.
3 3565 These three have robb’d me; and this demi-devil--
3 3566 For he’s a bastard one--had plotted with them
3 3567 To take my life. Two of these fellows you
3 3568 Must know and own; this thing of darkness I                        275
3 3569 Acknowledge mine.
3 3570 
3 3571 _Cal._          I shall be pinch’d to death.
3 3572 
3 3573 _Alon._ Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?
3 3574 
3 3575 _Seb._ He is drunk now: where had he wine?
3 3576 
3 3577 _Alon._ And Trinculo is reeling ripe: where should they
3 3578 Find this grand liquor that hath gilded ’em?--                     280
3 3579 How camest thou in this pickle?
3 3580 
3 3581 _Trin._ I have been in such a pickle, since I saw you
3 3582 last, that, I fear me, will never out of my bones: I shall not
3 3583 fear fly-blowing.
3 3584 
3 3585 _Seb._ Why, how now, Stephano!                                     285
3 3586 
3 3587 _Ste._ O, touch me not;--I am not Stephano, but a cramp.
3 3588 
3 3589 _Pros._ You’ld be king o’ the isle, sirrah?
3 3590 
3 3591 _Ste._ I should have been a sore one, then.
3 3592 
3 3593 _Alon._ This is a strange thing as e’er I look’d on.
3 3594                                 [_Pointing to Caliban._
3 3595 
3 3596 _Pros._ He is as disproportion’d in his manners                    290
3 3597 As in his shape. Go, sirrah, to my cell;
3 3598 Take with you your companions; as you look
3 3599 To have my pardon, trim it handsomely.
3 3600 
3 3601 _Cal._ Ay, that I will; and I’ll be wise hereafter,
3 3602 And seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass                       295
3 3603 Was I, to take this drunkard for a god,
3 3604 And worship this dull fool!
3 3605 
3 3606 _Pros._                Go to; away!
3 3607 
3 3608 _Alon._ Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it.
3 3609 
3 3610 _Seb._ Or stole it, rather.    [_Exeunt Cal., Ste., and Trin._
3 3611 
3 3612 _Pros._ Sir, I invite your Highness and your train                 300
3 3613 To my poor cell, where you shall take your rest
3 3614 For this one night; which, part of it, I’ll waste
3 3615 With such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make it
3 3616 Go quick away: the story of my life,
3 3617 And the particular accidents gone by                               305
3 3618 Since I came to this isle: and in the morn
3 3619 I’ll bring you to your ship, and so to Naples,
3 3620 Where I have hope to see the nuptial
3 3621 Of these our dear-beloved solemnized;
3 3622 And thence retire me to my Milan, where                            310
3 3623 Every third thought shall be my grave.
3 3624 
3 3625 _Alon._                              I long
3 3626 To hear the story of your life, which must
3 3627 Take the ear strangely.
3 3628 
3 3629 _Pros._               I’ll deliver all;
3 3630 And promise you calm seas, auspicious gales,
3 3631 And sail so expeditious, that shall catch
3 3632 Your royal fleet far off. [_Aside to Ari._] My Ariel, chick,       315
3 3633 That is thy charge: then to the elements
3 3634 Be free, and fare thou well! Please you, draw near.

3 3732 Now my charms are all o’erthrown,
3 3733 And what strength I have’s mine own,
3 3734 Which is most faint: now, ’tis true,
3 3735 I must be here confined by you,
3 3736 Or sent to Naples. Let me not,                                       5
3 3737 Since I have my dukedom got,
3 3738 And pardon’d the deceiver, dwell
3 3739 In this bare island by your spell;
3 3740 But release me from my bands
3 3741 With the help of your good hands:                                   10
3 3742 Gentle breath of yours my sails
3 3743 Must fill, or else my project fails,
3 3744 Which was to please. Now I want
3 3745 Spirits to enforce, art to enchant;
3 3746 And my ending is despair,                                           15
3 3747 Unless I be relieved by prayer,
3 3748 Which pierces so, that it assaults
3 3749 Mercy itself, and frees all faults.
3 3750 As you from crimes would pardon’d be,
3 3751 Let your indulgence set me free.                                    20

3 3764 NOTES.
3 3765 
3 3766 
3 3767 NOTE I.
3 3768 
3 3769 I. 1. 15. _What cares these roarers._ This grammatical inaccuracy, which
3 3770 escaped correction in the later folios, probably came from Shakespeare’s
3 3771 pen. Similar cases occur frequently, especially when the verb precedes
3 3772 its nominative. For example, _Tempest_, IV. 1. 262, ‘Lies at my mercy
3 3773 all mine enemies,’ and _Measure for Measure_, II. 1. 22, ‘What knows the
3 3774 laws, &c.’ We correct it in those passages where the occurrence of a
3 3775 vulgarism would be likely to annoy the reader. In the mouth of a
3 3776 Boatswain it can offend no one. We therefore leave it.
3 3777 
3 3778 
3 3779 NOTE II.
3 3780 
3 3781 I. 1. 57-59. _Mercy on us!--we split, &c._ It may be doubtful whether
3 3782 the printer of the first folio intended these broken speeches to express
3 3783 ‘a confused noise within.’ Without question such was the author’s
3 3784 meaning. Rowe, however, and subsequent editors, printed them as part of
3 3785 Gonzalo’s speech. Capell was the first editor who gave the true
3 3786 arrangement.
3 3787 
3 3788 
3 3789 NOTE III.
3 3790 
3 3791 I. 2. 173. _princesses._ See Mr Sidney Walker’s _Shakespeare’s
3 3792 Versification_, p. 243 sqq. ’The plurals of substantives ending in _s_,
3 3793 in certain instances, in _se_, _ss_, _ce_, and sometimes _ge_, ... are
3 3794 found without the usual addition of _s_ or _es_, in pronunciation at
3 3795 least, although in many instances the plural affix is added in printing,
3 3796 where the metre shows that it is not to be pronounced.’
3 3797 
3 3798 In this and other instances, we have thought it better to trust to the
3 3799 ear of the reader for the rhythm than to introduce an innovation in
3 3800 orthography which might perplex him as to the sense. The form
3 3801 ‘princesses,’ the use of which in Shakespeare’s time was doubted by one
3 3802 of our correspondents, is found in the _History of King Leir_.
3 3803 
3 3804 Rowe’s reading ‘princes’ might be defended on the ground that the
3 3805 sentiment is general, and applicable to royal children of both sexes; or
3 3806 that Sir Philip Sidney, in the first book of the _Arcadia_, calls Pamela
3 3807 and Philoclea ‘princes.’
3 3808 
3 3809 
3 3810 NOTE IV.
3 3811 
3 3812 I. 2. 298. The metre of this line, as well as of lines 301, 302, is
3 3813 defective, but as no mode of correction can be regarded as completely
3 3814 satisfactory we have in accordance with our custom left the lines as
3 3815 they are printed in the Folio. The defect, indeed, in the metre of line
3 3816 298 has not been noticed except by Hanmer, who makes a line thus:
3 3817 
3 3818   ‘Do so, and after two days I’ll discharge thee.’
3 3819 
3 3820 Possibly it ought to be printed thus:
3 3821 
3 3822               ‘Do so; and
3 3823   After two days
3 3824   I will discharge thee.’
3 3825 
3 3826 There is a broken line, also of four syllables, 253 of the same scene,
3 3827 another of seven, 235.
3 3828 
3 3829 There is no reason to doubt that the _words_ are as Shakespeare wrote
3 3830 them, for, although the action of the play terminates in less than four
3 3831 hours (I. 2. 240 and V. 1. 186), yet Ariel’s ministry is not to end till
3 3832 the voyage to Naples shall be over. Prospero, too, repeats his promise,
3 3833 and marks his contentment by further shortening the time of servitude,
3 3834 ‘within two days,’ I. 2. 420. Possibly ‘Invisible’ (301) should have a
3 3835 line to itself. Words thus occupying a broken line acquire a marked
3 3836 emphasis.
3 3837 
3 3838 But the truth is that in dialogue Shakespeare’s language passes so
3 3839 rapidly from verse to prose and from prose to verse, sometimes even
3 3840 hovering, as it were, over the confines, being rhythmical rather than
3 3841 metrical, that all attempts to give regularity to the metre must be made
3 3842 with diffidence and received with doubt.
3 3843 
3 3844 
3 3845 NOTE V.
3 3846 
3 3847 I. 2. 377, 378:
3 3848 
3 3849   _Courtsied when you have and kiss’d_
3 3850   _The wild waves whist._
3 3851 
3 3852 This punctuation seems to be supported by what Ferdinand says (391,
3 3853 392):
3 3854 
3 3855   ‘The music crept by me upon the waters,
3 3856   Allaying both their fury and my passion, &c.’
3 3857 
3 3858 At the end of the stanza we have printed _Hark, hark! ... The watch-dogs
3 3859 bark_ as that part of the burthen which ‘sweet sprites bear.’ The other
3 3860 part is borne by distant watch-dogs.
3 3861 
3 3862 
3 3863 NOTE VI.
3 3864 
3 3865 I. 2. 443. _I fear you have done yourself some wrong._ See this phrase
3 3866 used in a similar sense, _Measure for Measure_, I. 11. 39.
3 3867 
3 3868 
3 3869 NOTE VII.
3 3870 
3 3871 II. 1. 27. _Which, of he or Adrian._ ‘Of’ is found in the same
3 3872 construction, _Midsummer Night’s Dream_, III. 2. 336,
3 3873 
3 3874   ‘Now follow if thou darest to try whose right,
3 3875   Of thine or mine, is most in Helena.’
3 3876 
3 3877 
3 3878 NOTE VIII.
3 3879 
3 3880 II. 1. 157. _Of its own kind._ There is no doubt, as Dr Guest has shewn,
3 3881 that ‘it,’ which is the reading of the 1st and 2nd folios, was commonly
3 3882 used as a genitive in Shakespeare’s time, as it is still in some
3 3883 provincial dialects. ‘Its,’ however, was coming into use. One instance
3 3884 occurs in this play, I. 11. 95, ‘in its contrary.’
3 3885 
3 3886 
3 3887 NOTE IX.
3 3888 
3 3889 II. 1. 241. _she that from whom._ Mr Spedding writes: ‘The received
3 3890 emendation is not satisfactory to me. I would rather read, “She
3 3891 that--From whom? All were sea-swallow’d &c., i.e. from whom should she
3 3892 have note? The report from Naples will be that all were drowned. We
3 3893 shall be the only survivors.” The break in the construction seems to me
3 3894 characteristic of the speaker. But you must read the whole speech to
3 3895 feel the effect.’
3 3896 
3 3897 
3 3898 NOTE X.
3 3899 
3 3900 II. 1. 249-251. All editors except Mr Staunton have printed in italics
3 3901 (or between inverted commas) only as far as ‘_Naples?_’, but as ‘_keep_’
3 3902 is printed with a small k in the folios, they seem to sanction the
3 3903 arrangement given in our text.
3 3904 
3 3905 
3 3906 NOTE XI.
3 3907 
3 3908 II. 1. 267. _Ay, sir; where lies that? if ’twere a kibe._ Mr Singer and
3 3909 Mr Dyce have changed ‘’twere’ to ‘it were’ for the sake of the metre.
3 3910 But then the first part of the line must be read with a wrong emphasis.
3 3911 The proper emphasis clearly falls on the first, third, and fifth
3 3912 syllables, ‘Aý, sir; whére lies thát?’ See Preface.
3 3913 
3 3914 
3 3915 NOTE XII.
3 3916 
3 3917 II. 2. 165. Before ‘here; bear my bottle’ Capell inserts a stage
3 3918 direction [_To Cal._], but it appears from III. 2. 62, that Trinculo was
3 3919 entrusted with the office of bottle-bearer.
3 3920 
3 3921 
3 3922 NOTE XIII.
3 3923 
3 3924 III. 1. 15. _Most busy lest, when I do it._ As none of the proposed
3 3925 emendations can be regarded as certain, we have left the reading of F1,
3 3926 though it is manifestly corrupt. The spelling ‘doe’ makes Mr Spedding’s
3 3927 conjecture ‘idlest’ for ‘I doe it’ more probable.
3 3928 
3 3929 
3 3930 NOTE XIV.
3 3931 
3 3932 III. 3. 17. The stage direction, which we have divided into two parts,
3 3933 is placed all at once in the folios after ‘as when they are fresh’
3 3934 [Solemne and strange Musicke; and Prosper on the top (invisible:) Enter
3 3935 ... depart].
3 3936 
3 3937 Pope transferred it to follow Sebastian’s words, ‘I say, to night: no
3 3938 more.’
3 3939 
3 3940 
3 3941 NOTE XV.
3 3942 
3 3943 III. 3. 48. _Each putter out of five for one._ See Beaumont and
3 3944 Fletcher, _The Noble Gentleman_, I. 1. (Vol. II. p. 261, ed. Moxon):
3 3945 ‘The return will give you five for one.’ MARINE is about to travel.
3 3946 
3 3947 
3 3948 NOTE XVI.
3 3949 
3 3950 IV. 1. 146. _You do look, my son, in a moved sort._ Seymour suggests a
3 3951 transposition: ‘you do, my son, look in a moved sort.’ This line however
3 3952 can scarcely have come from Shakespeare’s pen. Perhaps the writer who
3 3953 composed the Masque was allowed to join it, as best he might, to
3 3954 Shakespeare’s words, which re-commence at ‘Our revels now are ended,’
3 3955 &c.

3 3966 V. 1. 309. _Of these our dear-beloved solemnized._ The Folios have
3 3967 ‘belov’d’; a mode of spelling, which in this case is convenient as
3 3968 indicating the probable rhythm of the verse. We have written ‘beloved,’
3 3969 in accordance with the general rule mentioned in the Preface.
3 3970 
3 3971 ‘Solemnized’ occurs in four other verse passages of Shakespeare. It is
3 3972 three times to be accented ‘sólemnized’ and once (_Love’s Labour’s
3 3973 Lost_, II. 1. 41) ‘solémnized.’

3 3981 The editors’ Preface (e-text 23041) discusses the 17th- and
3 3982 18th-century editions in detail; the newer (19th-century) editions
3 3983 are simply listed by name. The following editions may appear in the
3 3984 Notes. All inset text is quoted from the Preface.

3 3988     “The five plays contained in this volume occur in the first Folio
3 3989     in the same order, and ... were there printed for the first time.”
3 3990 
3 3991   Early editions:
3 3992   Rowe 1709
3 3993   Pope 1715
3 3994     “Pope was the first to indicate the _place_ of each new scene;
3 3995     as, for instance, _Tempest_, I. 1. ‘On a ship at sea.’ He also
3 3996     subdivided the scenes as given by the Folios and Rowe, making
3 3997     a fresh scene whenever a new character entered--an arrangement
3 3998     followed by Hanmer, Warburton, and Johnson. For convenience of
3 3999     reference to these editions, we have always recorded the
3 4000     commencement of Pope’s scenes.”

3 4089 PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK
3 4090 
3 4091 To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
3 4092 distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
3 4093 (or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
3 4094 Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
3 4095 Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
3 4096 http://gutenberg.org/license).

3 4098 
3 4099 Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
3 4100 electronic works
3 4101 
3 4102 1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
3 4103 electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
3 4104 and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
3 4105 (trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
3 4106 the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
3 4107 all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
3 4108 If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
3 4109 Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
3 4110 terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
3 4111 entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
3 4112 
3 4113 1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
3 4114 used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
3 4115 agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
3 4116 things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
3 4117 even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
3 4118 paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
3 4119 Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
3 4120 and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
3 4121 works.  See paragraph 1.E below.
3 4122 
3 4123 1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
3 4124 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
3 4125 Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
3 4126 collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
3 4127 individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
3 4128 located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
3 4129 copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
3 4130 works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
3 4131 are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
3 4132 Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
3 4133 freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
3 4134 this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
3 4135 the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
3 4136 keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
3 4137 Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.
3 4138 
3 4139 1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
3 4140 what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
3 4141 a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
3 4142 the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
3 4143 before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
3 4144 creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
3 4145 Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
3 4146 the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
3 4147 States.
3 4148 
3 4149 1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
3 4150 
3 4151 1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
3 4152 access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
3 4153 whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
3 4154 phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
3 4155 Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
3 4156 copied or distributed:

3 4162 
3 4163 1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
3 4164 from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
3 4165 posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
3 4166 and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
3 4167 or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
3 4168 with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
3 4169 work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
3 4170 through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
3 4171 Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
3 4172 1.E.9.
3 4173 
3 4174 1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
3 4175 with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
3 4176 must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
3 4177 terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
3 4178 to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the

3 4185 1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

3 4189 Gutenberg-tm License.

3 4191 1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
3 4192 compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
3 4193 word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
3 4194 distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
3 4195 "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
3 4196 posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
3 4197 you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
3 4198 copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
3 4199 request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
3 4200 form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
3 4201 License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
3 4202 
3 4203 1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
3 4204 performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
3 4205 unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
3 4206 
3 4207 1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
3 4208 access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
3 4209 that
3 4210 
3 4211 - You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
3 4212      the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
3 4213      you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
3 4214      owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
3 4215      has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
3 4216      Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
3 4217      must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
3 4218      prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
3 4219      returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
3 4220      sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
3 4221      address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
3 4222      the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."
3 4223 
3 4224 - You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
3 4225      you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
3 4226      does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
3 4227      License.  You must require such a user to return or
3 4228      destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
3 4229      and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
3 4230      Project Gutenberg-tm works.
3 4231 
3 4232 - You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
3 4233      money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
3 4234      electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
3 4235      of receipt of the work.
3 4236 
3 4237 - You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
3 4238      distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.
3 4239 
3 4240 1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
3 4241 electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
3 4242 forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
3 4243 both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
3 4244 Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

3 4246 
3 4247 1.F.
3 4248 
3 4249 1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
3 4250 effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
3 4251 public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
3 4252 collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
3 4253 works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
3 4254 "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
3 4255 corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
3 4256 property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
3 4257 computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
3 4258 your equipment.
3 4259 
3 4260 1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
3 4261 of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
3 4262 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
3 4263 Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
3 4264 Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
3 4265 liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
3 4266 fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
3 4267 LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
3 4268 PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
3 4269 TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
3 4270 LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
3 4271 INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
3 4272 DAMAGE.
3 4273 
3 4274 1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
3 4275 defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
3 4276 receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
3 4277 written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
3 4278 received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
3 4279 your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
3 4280 the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
3 4281 refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
3 4282 providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
3 4283 receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
3 4284 is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
3 4285 opportunities to fix the problem.
3 4286 
3 4287 1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
3 4288 in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
3 4289 WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
3 4290 WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
3 4291 
3 4292 1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
3 4293 warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
3 4294 If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
3 4295 law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
3 4296 interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
3 4297 the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
3 4298 provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.
3 4299 
3 4300 1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
3 4301 trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
3 4302 providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
3 4303 with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
3 4304 promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
3 4305 harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
3 4306 that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
3 4307 or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
3 4308 work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
3 4309 Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.
3 4310 
3 4311 
3 4312 Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
3 4313 
3 4314 Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
3 4315 electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
3 4316 including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
3 4317 because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
3 4318 people in all walks of life.
3 4319 
3 4320 Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
3 4321 assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
3 4322 goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
3 4323 remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
3 4324 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
3 4325 and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
3 4326 To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
3 4327 and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

3 4357 Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
3 4358 Literary Archive Foundation
3 4359 
3 4360 Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
3 4361 spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
3 4362 increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
3 4363 freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
3 4364 array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
3 4365 ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
3 4366 status with the IRS.
3 4367 
3 4368 The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
3 4369 charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
3 4370 States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
3 4371 considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
3 4372 with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
3 4373 where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
3 4374 SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
3 4375 particular state visit http://pglaf.org
3 4376 
3 4377 While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
3 4378 have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
3 4379 against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
3 4380 approach us with offers to donate.
3 4381 
3 4382 International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
3 4383 any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
3 4384 outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
3 4385 
3 4386 Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
3 4387 methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
3 4388 ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

3 4392 Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
3 4393 works.
3 4394 
3 4395 Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
3 4396 concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
3 4397 with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
3 4398 Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
3 4399 
3 4400 
3 4401 Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
3 4402 editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
3 4403 unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
3 4404 keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
