9 0 The Life of Henry the Fift
9 1 
9 2 Enter Prologue.
9 3 
9 4 O For a Muse of Fire, that would ascend
9 5 The brightest Heauen of Inuention:
9 6 A Kingdome for a Stage, Princes to Act,
9 7 And Monarchs to behold the swelling Scene.
9 8 Then should the Warlike Harry, like himselfe,
9 9 Assume the Port of Mars, and at his heeles
9 10 (Leasht in, like Hounds) should Famine, Sword, and Fire
9 11 Crouch for employment. But pardon, Gentles all:
9 12 The flat vnraysed Spirits, that hath dar'd,
9 13 On this vnworthy Scaffold, to bring forth
9 14 So great an Obiect. Can this Cock-Pit hold
9 15 The vastie fields of France? Or may we cramme
9 16 Within this Woodden O, the very Caskes
9 17 That did affright the Ayre at Agincourt?
9 18 O pardon: since a crooked Figure may
9 19 Attest in little place a Million,
9 20 And let vs, Cyphers to this great Accompt,
9 21 On your imaginarie Forces worke.
9 22 Suppose within the Girdle of these Walls
9 23 Are now confin'd two mightie Monarchies,
9 24 Whose high, vp-reared, and abutting Fronts,
9 25 The perillous narrow Ocean parts asunder.
9 26 Peece out our imperfections with your thoughts:
9 27 Into a thousand parts diuide one Man,
9 28 And make imaginarie Puissance.
9 29 Thinke when we talke of Horses, that you see them
9 30 Printing their prowd Hoofes i'th' receiuing Earth:
9 31 For 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our Kings,
9 32 Carry them here and there: Iumping o're Times;
9 33 Turning th' accomplishment of many yeeres
9 34 Into an Howre-glasse: for the which supplie,
9 35 Admit me Chorus to this Historie;
9 36 Who Prologue-like, your humble patience pray,
9 37 Gently to heare, kindly to iudge our Play.
9 38 Enter.
9 39 
9 40 
9 41 Actus Primus. Scoena Prima.
9 42 
9 43 Enter the two Bishops of Canterbury and Ely.
9 44 
9 45   Bish.Cant. My Lord, Ile tell you, that selfe Bill is vrg'd,
9 46 Which in th' eleue[n]th yere of y last Kings reign
9 47 Was like, and had indeed against vs past,
9 48 But that the scambling and vnquiet time
9 49 Did push it out of farther question
9 50 
9 51    Bish.Ely. But how my Lord shall we resist it now?
9 52   Bish.Cant. It must be thought on: if it passe against vs,
9 53 We loose the better halfe of our Possession:
9 54 For all the Temporall Lands, which men deuout
9 55 By Testament haue giuen to the Church,
9 56 Would they strip from vs; being valu'd thus,
9 57 As much as would maintaine, to the Kings honor,
9 58 Full fifteene Earles, and fifteene hundred Knights,
9 59 Six thousand and two hundred good Esquires:
9 60 And to reliefe of Lazars, and weake age
9 61 Of indigent faint Soules, past corporall toyle,
9 62 A hundred Almes-houses, right well supply'd:
9 63 And to the Coffers of the King beside,
9 64 A thousand pounds by th' yeere. Thus runs the Bill
9 65 
9 66    Bish.Ely. This would drinke deepe
9 67 
9 68    Bish.Cant. 'Twould drinke the Cup and all
9 69 
9 70    Bish.Ely. But what preuention?
9 71   Bish.Cant. The King is full of grace, and faire regard
9 72 
9 73    Bish.Ely. And a true louer of the holy Church
9 74 
9 75    Bish.Cant. The courses of his youth promis'd it not.
9 76 The breath no sooner left his Fathers body,
9 77 But that his wildnesse, mortify'd in him,
9 78 Seem'd to dye too: yea, at that very moment,
9 79 Consideration like an Angell came,
9 80 And whipt th' offending Adam out of him;
9 81 Leauing his body as a Paradise,
9 82 T' inuelop and containe Celestiall Spirits.
9 83 Neuer was such a sodaine Scholler made:
9 84 Neuer came Reformation in a Flood,
9 85 With such a heady currance scowring faults:
9 86 Nor neuer Hidra-headed Wilfulnesse
9 87 So soone did loose his Seat; and all at once;
9 88 As in this King
9 89 
9 90    Bish.Ely. We are blessed in the Change
9 91 
9 92    Bish.Cant. Heare him but reason in Diuinitie;
9 93 And all-admiring, with an inward wish
9 94 You would desire the King were made a Prelate:
9 95 Heare him debate of Common-wealth Affaires;
9 96 You would say, it hath been all in all his study:
9 97 List his discourse of Warre; and you shall heare
9 98 A fearefull Battaile rendred you in Musique.
9 99 Turne him to any Cause of Pollicy,
9 100 The Gordian Knot of it he will vnloose,
9 101 Familiar as his Garter: that when he speakes,
9 102 The Ayre, a Charter'd Libertine, is still,
9 103 And the mute Wonder lurketh in mens eares,
9 104 To steale his sweet and honyed Sentences:
9 105 So that the Art and Practique part of Life,
9 106 Must be the Mistresse to this Theorique.
9 107 Which is a wonder how his Grace should gleane it,
9 108 Since his addiction was to Courses vaine,
9 109 His Companies vnletter'd, rude, and shallow,
9 110 His Houres fill'd vp with Ryots, Banquets, Sports;
9 111 And neuer noted in him any studie,
9 112 Any retyrement, any sequestration,
9 113 From open Haunts and Popularitie
9 114 
9 115    B.Ely. The Strawberry growes vnderneath the Nettle,
9 116 And holesome Berryes thriue and ripen best,
9 117 Neighbour'd by Fruit of baser qualitie:
9 118 And so the Prince obscur'd his Contemplation
9 119 Vnder the Veyle of Wildnesse, which (no doubt)
9 120 Grew like the Summer Grasse, fastest by Night,
9 121 Vnseene, yet cressiue in his facultie
9 122 
9 123    B.Cant. It must be so; for Miracles are ceast:
9 124 And therefore we must needes admit the meanes,
9 125 How things are perfected
9 126 
9 127    B.Ely. But my good Lord:
9 128 How now for mittigation of this Bill,
9 129 Vrg'd by the Commons? doth his Maiestie
9 130 Incline to it, or no?
9 131   B.Cant. He seemes indifferent:
9 132 Or rather swaying more vpon our part,
9 133 Then cherishing th' exhibiters against vs:
9 134 For I haue made an offer to his Maiestie,
9 135 Vpon our Spirituall Conuocation,
9 136 And in regard of Causes now in hand,
9 137 Which I haue open'd to his Grace at large,
9 138 As touching France, to giue a greater Summe,
9 139 Then euer at one time the Clergie yet
9 140 Did to his Predecessors part withall
9 141 
9 142    B.Ely. How did this offer seeme receiu'd, my Lord?
9 143   B.Cant. With good acceptance of his Maiestie:
9 144 Saue that there was not time enough to heare,
9 145 As I perceiu'd his Grace would faine haue done,
9 146 The seueralls and vnhidden passages
9 147 Of his true Titles to some certaine Dukedomes,
9 148 And generally, to the Crowne and Seat of France,
9 149 Deriu'd from Edward, his great Grandfather
9 150 
9 151    B.Ely. What was th' impediment that broke this off?
9 152   B.Cant. The French Embassador vpon that instant
9 153 Crau'd audience; and the howre I thinke is come,
9 154 To giue him hearing: Is it foure a Clock?
9 155   B.Ely. It is
9 156 
9 157    B.Cant. Then goe we in, to know his Embassie:
9 158 Which I could with a ready guesse declare,
9 159 Before the Frenchman speake a word of it
9 160 
9 161    B.Ely. Ile wait vpon you, and I long to heare it.
9 162 
9 163 Exeunt.
9 164 
9 165 Enter the King, Humfrey, Bedford, Clarence, Warwick,
9 166 Westmerland, and
9 167 Exeter.
9 168 
9 169   King. Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury?
9 170   Exeter. Not here in presence
9 171 
9 172    King. Send for him, good Vnckle
9 173 
9 174    Westm. Shall we call in th' Ambassador, my Liege?
9 175   King. Not yet, my Cousin: we would be resolu'd,
9 176 Before we heare him, of some things of weight,
9 177 That taske our thoughts, concerning vs and France.
9 178 Enter two Bishops.
9 179 
9 180   B.Cant. God and his Angels guard your sacred Throne,
9 181 And make you long become it
9 182 
9 183    King. Sure we thanke you.
9 184 My learned Lord, we pray you to proceed,
9 185 And iustly and religiously vnfold,
9 186 Why the Law Salike, that they haue in France,
9 187 Or should or should not barre vs in our Clayme:
9 188 And God forbid, my deare and faithfull Lord,
9 189 That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,
9 190 Or nicely charge your vnderstanding Soule,
9 191 With opening Titles miscreate, whose right
9 192 Sutes not in natiue colours with the truth:
9 193 For God doth know, how many now in health,
9 194 Shall drop their blood, in approbation
9 195 Of what your reuerence shall incite vs to.
9 196 Therefore take heed how you impawne our Person,
9 197 How you awake our sleeping Sword of Warre;
9 198 We charge you in the Name of God take heed:
9 199 For neuer two such Kingdomes did contend,
9 200 Without much fall of blood, whose guiltlesse drops
9 201 Are euery one, a Woe, a sore Complaint,
9 202 'Gainst him, whose wrongs giues edge vnto the Swords,
9 203 That makes such waste in briefe mortalitie.
9 204 Vnder this Coniuration, speake my Lord:
9 205 For we will heare, note, and beleeue in heart,
9 206 That what you speake, is in your Conscience washt,
9 207 As pure as sinne with Baptisme
9 208 
9 209    B.Can. Then heare me gracious Soueraign, & you Peers,
9 210 That owe your selues, your liues, and seruices,
9 211 To this Imperiall Throne. There is no barre
9 212 To make against your Highnesse Clayme to France,
9 213 But this which they produce from Pharamond,
9 214 In terram Salicam Mulieres ne succedant,
9 215 No Woman shall succeed in Salike Land:
9 216 Which Salike Land, the French vniustly gloze
9 217 To be the Realme of France, and Pharamond
9 218 The founder of this Law, and Female Barre.
9 219 Yet their owne Authors faithfully affirme,
9 220 That the Land Salike is in Germanie,
9 221 Betweene the Flouds of Sala and of Elue:
9 222 Where Charles the Great hauing subdu'd the Saxons,
9 223 There left behind and settled certaine French:
9 224 Who holding in disdaine the German Women,
9 225 For some dishonest manners of their life,
9 226 Establisht then this Law; to wit, No Female
9 227 Should be Inheritrix in Salike Land:
9 228 Which Salike (as I said) 'twixt Elue and Sala,
9 229 Is at this day in Germanie, call'd Meisen.
9 230 Then doth it well appeare, the Salike Law
9 231 Was not deuised for the Realme of France:
9 232 Nor did the French possesse the Salike Land,
9 233 Vntill foure hundred one and twentie yeeres
9 234 After defunction of King Pharamond,
9 235 Idly suppos'd the founder of this Law,
9 236 Who died within the yeere of our Redemption,
9 237 Foure hundred twentie six: and Charles the Great
9 238 Subdu'd the Saxons, and did seat the French
9 239 Beyond the Riuer Sala, in the yeere
9 240 Eight hundred fiue. Besides, their Writers say,
9 241 King Pepin, which deposed Childerike,
9 242 Did as Heire Generall, being descended
9 243 Of Blithild, which was Daughter to King Clothair,
9 244 Make Clayme and Title to the Crowne of France.
9 245 Hugh Capet also, who vsurpt the Crowne
9 246 Of Charles the Duke of Loraine, sole Heire male
9 247 Of the true Line and Stock of Charles the Great:
9 248 To find his Title with some shewes of truth,
9 249 Though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught,
9 250 Conuey'd himselfe as th' Heire to th' Lady Lingare,
9 251 Daughter to Charlemaine, who was the Sonne
9 252 To Lewes the Emperour, and Lewes the Sonne
9 253 Of Charles the Great: also King Lewes the Tenth,
9 254 Who was sole Heire to the Vsurper Capet,
9 255 Could not keepe quiet in his conscience,
9 256 Wearing the Crowne of France, 'till satisfied,
9 257 That faire Queene Isabel, his Grandmother,
9 258 Was Lineall of the Lady Ermengare,
9 259 Daughter to Charles the foresaid Duke of Loraine:
9 260 By the which Marriage, the Lyne of Charles the Great
9 261 Was re-vnited to the Crowne of France.
9 262 So, that as cleare as is the Summers Sunne,
9 263 King Pepins Title, and Hugh Capets Clayme,
9 264 King Lewes his satisfaction, all appeare
9 265 To hold in Right and Title of the Female:
9 266 So doe the Kings of France vnto this day.
9 267 Howbeit, they would hold vp this Salique Law,
9 268 To barre your Highnesse clayming from the Female,
9 269 And rather chuse to hide them in a Net,
9 270 Then amply to imbarre their crooked Titles,
9 271 Vsurpt from you and your Progenitors
9 272 
9 273    King. May I with right and conscience make this claim?
9 274   Bish.Cant. The sinne vpon my head, dread Soueraigne:
9 275 For in the Booke of Numbers is it writ,
9 276 When the man dyes, let the Inheritance
9 277 Descend vnto the Daughter. Gracious Lord,
9 278 Stand for your owne, vnwind your bloody Flagge,
9 279 Looke back into your mightie Ancestors:
9 280 Goe my dread Lord, to your great Grandsires Tombe,
9 281 From whom you clayme; inuoke his Warlike Spirit,
9 282 And your Great Vnckles, Edward the Black Prince,
9 283 Who on the French ground play'd a Tragedie,
9 284 Making defeat on the full Power of France:
9 285 Whiles his most mightie Father on a Hill
9 286 Stood smiling, to behold his Lyons Whelpe
9 287 Forrage in blood of French Nobilitie.
9 288 O Noble English, that could entertaine
9 289 With halfe their Forces, the full pride of France,
9 290 And let another halfe stand laughing by,
9 291 All out of worke, and cold for action
9 292 
9 293    Bish. Awake remembrance of these valiant dead,
9 294 And with your puissant Arme renew their Feats;
9 295 You are their Heire, you sit vpon their Throne:
9 296 The Blood and Courage that renowned them,
9 297 Runs in your Veines: and my thrice-puissant Liege
9 298 Is in the very May-Morne of his Youth,
9 299 Ripe for Exploits and mightie Enterprises
9 300 
9 301    Exe. Your Brother Kings and Monarchs of the Earth
9 302 Doe all expect, that you should rowse your selfe,
9 303 As did the former Lyons of your Blood
9 304 
9 305    West. They know your Grace hath cause, and means, and might;
9 306 So hath your Highnesse: neuer King of England
9 307 Had Nobles richer, and more loyall Subiects,
9 308 Whose hearts haue left their bodyes here in England,
9 309 And lye pauillion'd in the fields of France
9 310 
9 311    Bish.Can. O let their bodyes follow my deare Liege
9 312 With Bloods, and Sword and Fire, to win your Right:
9 313 In ayde whereof, we of the Spiritualtie
9 314 Will rayse your Highnesse such a mightie Summe,
9 315 As neuer did the Clergie at one time
9 316 Bring in to any of your Ancestors
9 317 
9 318    King. We must not onely arme t' inuade the French,
9 319 But lay downe our proportions, to defend
9 320 Against the Scot, who will make roade vpon vs,
9 321 With all aduantages
9 322 
9 323    Bish.Can. They of those Marches, gracious Soueraign,
9 324 Shall be a Wall sufficient to defend
9 325 Our in-land from the pilfering Borderers
9 326 
9 327    King. We do not meane the coursing snatchers onely,
9 328 But feare the maine intendment of the Scot,
9 329 Who hath been still a giddy neighbour to vs:
9 330 For you shall reade, that my great Grandfather
9 331 Neuer went with his forces into France,
9 332 But that the Scot, on his vnfurnisht Kingdome,
9 333 Came pouring like the Tyde into a breach,
9 334 With ample and brim fulnesse of his force,
9 335 Galling the gleaned Land with hot Assayes,
9 336 Girding with grieuous siege, Castles and Townes:
9 337 That England being emptie of defence,
9 338 Hath shooke and trembled at th' ill neighbourhood
9 339 
9 340    B.Can. She hath bin the[n] more fear'd the[n] harm'd, my Liege:
9 341 For heare her but exampl'd by her selfe,
9 342 When all her Cheualrie hath been in France,
9 343 And shee a mourning Widdow of her Nobles,
9 344 Shee hath her selfe not onely well defended,
9 345 But taken and impounded as a Stray,
9 346 The King of Scots: whom shee did send to France,
9 347 To fill King Edwards fame with prisoner Kings,
9 348 And make their Chronicle as rich with prayse,
9 349 As is the Owse and bottome of the Sea
9 350 With sunken Wrack, and sum-lesse Treasuries
9 351 
9 352    Bish.Ely. But there's a saying very old and true,
9 353 If that you will France win, then with Scotland first begin.
9 354 For once the Eagle (England) being in prey,
9 355 To her vnguarded Nest, the Weazell (Scot)
9 356 Comes sneaking, and so sucks her Princely Egges,
9 357 Playing the Mouse in absence of the Cat,
9 358 To tame and hauocke more then she can eate
9 359 
9 360    Exet. It followes then, the Cat must stay at home,
9 361 Yet that is but a crush'd necessity,
9 362 Since we haue lockes to safegard necessaries,
9 363 And pretty traps to catch the petty theeues.
9 364 While that the Armed hand doth fight abroad,
9 365 Th' aduised head defends it selfe at home:
9 366 For Gouernment, though high, and low, and lower,
9 367 Put into parts, doth keepe in one consent,
9 368 Congreeing in a full and natural close,
9 369 Like Musicke
9 370 
9 371    Cant. Therefore doth heauen diuide
9 372 The state of man in diuers functions,
9 373 Setting endeuour in continual motion:
9 374 To which is fixed as an ayme or butt,
9 375 Obedience: for so worke the Hony Bees,
9 376 Creatures that by a rule in Nature teach
9 377 The Act of Order to a peopled Kingdome.
9 378 They haue a King, and Officers of sorts,
9 379 Where some like Magistrates correct at home:
9 380 Others, like Merchants venter Trade abroad:
9 381 Others, like Souldiers armed in their stings,
9 382 Make boote vpon the Summers Veluet buddes:
9 383 Which pillage, they with merry march bring home
9 384 To the Tent-royal of their Emperor:
9 385 Who busied in his Maiesties surueyes
9 386 The singing Masons building roofes of Gold,
9 387 The ciuil Citizens kneading vp the hony;
9 388 The poore Mechanicke Porters, crowding in
9 389 Their heauy burthens at his narrow gate:
9 390 The sad-ey'd Iustice with his surly humme,
9 391 Deliuering ore to Executors pale
9 392 The lazie yawning Drone: I this inferre,
9 393 That many things hauing full reference
9 394 To one consent, may worke contrariously,
9 395 As many Arrowes loosed seuerall wayes
9 396 Come to one marke: as many wayes meet in one towne,
9 397 As many fresh streames meet in one salt sea;
9 398 As many Lynes close in the Dials center:
9 399 So may a thousand actions once a foote,
9 400 And in one purpose, and be all well borne
9 401 Without defeat. Therefore to France, my Liege,
9 402 Diuide your happy England into foure,
9 403 Whereof, take you one quarter into France,
9 404 And you withall shall make all Gallia shake.
9 405 If we with thrice such powers left at home,
9 406 Cannot defend our owne doores from the dogge,
9 407 Let vs be worried, and our Nation lose
9 408 The name of hardinesse and policie
9 409 
9 410    King. Call in the Messengers sent from the Dolphin.
9 411 Now are we well resolu'd, and by Gods helpe
9 412 And yours, the noble sinewes of our power,
9 413 France being ours, wee'l bend it to our Awe,
9 414 Or breake it all to peeces. Or there wee'l sit,
9 415 (Ruling in large and ample Emperie,
9 416 Ore France, and all her (almost) Kingly Dukedomes)
9 417 Or lay these bones in an vnworthy Vrne,
9 418 Tomblesse, with no remembrance ouer them:
9 419 Either our History shall with full mouth
9 420 Speake freely of our Acts, or else our graue
9 421 Like Turkish mute, shall haue a tonguelesse mouth,
9 422 Not worshipt with a waxen Epitaph.
9 423 Enter Ambassadors of France.
9 424 
9 425 Now are we well prepar'd to know the pleasure
9 426 Of our faire Cosin Dolphin: for we heare,
9 427 Your greeting is from him, not from the King
9 428 
9 429    Amb. May't please your Maiestie to giue vs leaue
9 430 Freely to render what we haue in charge:
9 431 Or shall we sparingly shew you farre off
9 432 The Dolphins meaning, and our Embassie
9 433 
9 434    King. We are no Tyrant, but a Christian King,
9 435 Vnto whose grace our passion is as subiect
9 436 As is our wretches fettred in our prisons,
9 437 Therefore with franke and with vncurbed plainnesse,
9 438 Tell vs the Dolphins minde
9 439 
9 440    Amb. Thus than in few:
9 441 Your Highnesse lately sending into France,
9 442 Did claime some certaine Dukedomes, in the right
9 443 Of your great Predecessor, King Edward the third.
9 444 In answer of which claime, the Prince our Master
9 445 Sayes, that you sauour too much of your youth,
9 446 And bids you be aduis'd: There's nought in France,
9 447 That can be with a nimble Galliard wonne:
9 448 You cannot reuell into Dukedomes there.
9 449 He therefore sends you meeter for your spirit
9 450 This Tun of Treasure; and in lieu of this,
9 451 Desires you let the dukedomes that you claime
9 452 Heare no more of you. This the Dolphin speakes
9 453 
9 454    King. What Treasure Vncle?
9 455   Exe. Tennis balles, my Liege
9 456 
9 457    Kin. We are glad the Dolphin is so pleasant with vs,
9 458 His Present, and your paines we thanke you for:
9 459 When we haue matcht our Rackets to these Balles,
9 460 We will in France (by Gods grace) play a set,
9 461 Shall strike his fathers Crowne into the hazard.
9 462 Tell him, he hath made a match with such a Wrangler,
9 463 That all the Courts of France will be disturb'd
9 464 With Chaces. And we vnderstand him well,
9 465 How he comes o're vs with our wilder dayes,
9 466 Not measuring what vse we made of them.
9 467 We neuer valew'd this poore seate of England,
9 468 And therefore liuing hence, did giue our selfe
9 469 To barbarous license: As 'tis euer common,
9 470 That men are merriest, when they are from home.
9 471 But tell the Dolphin, I will keepe my State,
9 472 Be like a King, and shew my sayle of Greatnesse,
9 473 When I do rowse me in my Throne of France.
9 474 For that I haue layd by my Maiestie,
9 475 And plodded like a man for working dayes:
9 476 But I will rise there with so full a glorie,
9 477 That I will dazle all the eyes of France,
9 478 Yea strike the Dolphin blinde to looke on vs,
9 479 And tell the pleasant Prince, this Mocke of his
9 480 Hath turn'd his balles to Gun-stones, and his soule
9 481 Shall stand sore charged, for the wastefull vengeance
9 482 That shall flye with them: for many a thousand widows
9 483 Shall this his Mocke, mocke out of their deer husbands;
9 484 Mocke mothers from their sonnes, mock Castles downe:
9 485 And some are yet vngotten and vnborne,
9 486 That shal haue cause to curse the Dolphins scorne.
9 487 But this lyes all within the wil of God,
9 488 To whom I do appeale, and in whose name
9 489 Tel you the Dolphin, I am comming on,
9 490 To venge me as I may, and to put forth
9 491 My rightfull hand in a wel-hallow'd cause.
9 492 So get you hence in peace: And tell the Dolphin,
9 493 His Iest will sauour but of shallow wit,
9 494 When thousands weepe more then did laugh at it.
9 495 Conuey them with safe conduct. Fare you well.
9 496 
9 497 Exeunt. Ambassadors.
9 498 
9 499   Exe. This was a merry Message
9 500 
9 501    King. We hope to make the Sender blush at it:
9 502 Therefore, my Lords, omit no happy howre,
9 503 That may giue furth'rance to our Expedition:
9 504 For we haue now no thought in vs but France,
9 505 Saue those to God, that runne before our businesse.
9 506 Therefore let our proportions for these Warres
9 507 Be soone collected, and all things thought vpon,
9 508 That may with reasonable swiftnesse adde
9 509 More Feathers to our Wings: for God before,
9 510 Wee'le chide this Dolphin at his fathers doore.
9 511 Therefore let euery man now taske his thought,
9 512 That this faire Action may on foot be brought.
9 513 
9 514 Exeunt.
9 515 
9 516 Flourish. Enter Chorus.
9 517 
9 518 Now all the Youth of England are on fire,
9 519 And silken Dalliance in the Wardrobe lyes:
9 520 Now thriue the Armorers, and Honors thought
9 521 Reignes solely in the breast of euery man.
9 522 They sell the Pasture now, to buy the Horse;
9 523 Following the Mirror of all Christian Kings,
9 524 With winged heeles, as English Mercuries.
9 525 For now sits Expectation in the Ayre,
9 526 And hides a Sword, from Hilts vnto the Point,
9 527 With Crownes Imperiall, Crownes and Coronets,
9 528 Promis'd to Harry, and his followers.
9 529 The French aduis'd by good intelligence
9 530 Of this most dreadfull preparation,
9 531 Shake in their feare, and with pale Pollicy
9 532 Seeke to diuert the English purposes.
9 533 O England: Modell to thy inward Greatnesse,
9 534 Like little Body with a mightie Heart:
9 535 What mightst thou do, that honour would thee do,
9 536 Were all thy children kinde and naturall:
9 537 But see, thy fault France hath in thee found out,
9 538 A nest of hollow bosomes, which he filles
9 539 With treacherous Crownes, and three corrupted men:
9 540 One, Richard Earle of Cambridge, and the second
9 541 Henry Lord Scroope of Masham, and the third
9 542 Sir Thomas Grey Knight of Northumberland,
9 543 Haue for the Gilt of France (O guilt indeed)
9 544 Confirm'd Conspiracy with fearefull France,
9 545 And by their hands, this grace of Kings must dye.
9 546 If Hell and Treason hold their promises,
9 547 Ere he take ship for France; and in Southampton.
9 548 Linger your patience on, and wee'l digest
9 549 Th' abuse of distance; force a play:
9 550 The summe is payde, the Traitors are agreed,
9 551 The King is set from London, and the Scene
9 552 Is now transported (Gentles) to Southampton,
9 553 There is the Play-house now, there must you sit,
9 554 And thence to France shall we conuey you safe,
9 555 And bring you backe: Charming the narrow seas
9 556 To giue you gentle Passe: for if we may,
9 557 Wee'l not offend one stomacke with our Play.
9 558 But till the King come forth, and not till then,
9 559 Vnto Southampton do we shift our Scene.
9 560 
9 561 Exit
9 562 
9 563 Enter Corporall Nym, and Lieutenant Bardolfe.
9 564

9 566 
9 567    Nym. Good morrow Lieutenant Bardolfe
9 568 
9 569    Bar. What, are Ancient Pistoll and you friends yet?
9 570   Nym. For my part, I care not: I say little: but when
9 571 time shall serue, there shall be smiles, but that shall be as
9 572 it may. I dare not fight, but I will winke and holde out
9 573 mine yron: it is a simple one, but what though? It will
9 574 toste Cheese, and it will endure cold, as another mans
9 575 sword will: and there's an end
9 576 
9 577    Bar. I will bestow a breakfast to make you friendes,
9 578 and wee'l bee all three sworne brothers to France: Let't
9 579 be so good Corporall Nym
9 580 
9 581    Nym. Faith, I will liue so long as I may, that's the certaine
9 582 of it: and when I cannot liue any longer, I will doe
9 583 as I may: That is my rest, that is the rendeuous of it
9 584 
9 585    Bar. It is certaine Corporall, that he is marryed to
9 586 Nell Quickly, and certainly she did you wrong, for you
9 587 were troth-plight to her
9 588 
9 589    Nym. I cannot tell, Things must be as they may: men
9 590 may sleepe, and they may haue their throats about them
9 591 at that time, and some say, kniues haue edges: It must
9 592 be as it may, though patience be a tyred name, yet shee
9 593 will plodde, there must be Conclusions, well, I cannot
9 594 tell.
9 595 Enter Pistoll, & Quickly.

9 598 Corporall be patient heere. How now mine Hoaste Pistoll?
9 599   Pist. Base Tyke, cal'st thou mee Hoste, now by this
9 600 hand I sweare I scorne the terme: nor shall my Nel keep
9 601 Lodgers
9 602 
9 603    Host. No by my troth, not long: For we cannot lodge
9 604 and board a dozen or fourteene Gentlewomen that liue
9 605 honestly by the pricke of their Needles, but it will bee
9 606 thought we keepe a Bawdy-house straight. O welliday
9 607 Lady, if he be not hewne now, we shall see wilful adultery
9 608 and murther committed
9 609 
9 610    Bar. Good Lieutenant, good Corporal offer nothing
9 611 heere
9 612 
9 613    Nym. Pish

9 618    Host. Good Corporall Nym shew thy valor, and put
9 619 vp your sword
9 620 
9 621    Nym. Will you shogge off? I would haue you solus
9 622 
9 623    Pist. Solus, egregious dog? O Viper vile; The solus
9 624 in thy most meruailous face, the solus in thy teeth, and
9 625 in thy throate, and in thy hatefull Lungs, yea in thy Maw
9 626 perdy; and which is worse, within thy nastie mouth. I
9 627 do retort the solus in thy bowels, for I can take, and Pistols
9 628 cocke is vp, and flashing fire will follow
9 629 
9 630    Nym. I am not Barbason, you cannot coniure mee: I
9 631 haue an humor to knocke you indifferently well: If you
9 632 grow fowle with me Pistoll, I will scoure you with my
9 633 Rapier, as I may, in fayre tearmes. If you would walke
9 634 off, I would pricke your guts a little in good tearmes, as
9 635 I may, and that's the humor of it
9 636 
9 637    Pist. O Braggard vile, and damned furious wight,
9 638 The Graue doth gape, and doting death is neere,
9 639 Therefore exhale
9 640 
9 641    Bar. Heare me, heare me what I say: Hee that strikes
9 642 the first stroake, Ile run him vp to the hilts, as I am a soldier
9 643 
9 644    Pist. An oath of mickle might, and fury shall abate.
9 645 Giue me thy fist, thy fore-foote to me giue: Thy spirites
9 646 are most tall
9 647 
9 648    Nym. I will cut thy throate one time or other in faire
9 649 termes, that is the humor of it
9 650 
9 651    Pistoll. Couple a gorge, that is the word. I defie thee againe.
9 652 O hound of Creet, think'st thou my spouse to get?
9 653 No, to the spittle goe, and from the Poudring tub of infamy,
9 654 fetch forth the Lazar Kite of Cressids kinde, Doll
9 655 Teare-sheete, she by name, and her espouse. I haue, and I
9 656 will hold the Quondam Quickely for the onely shee: and
9 657 Pauca, there's enough to go to.
9 658 Enter the Boy.
9 659 
9 660   Boy. Mine Hoast Pistoll, you must come to my Mayster,
9 661 and your Hostesse: He is very sicke, & would to bed.
9 662 Good Bardolfe, put thy face betweene his sheets, and do
9 663 the Office of a Warming-pan: Faith, he's very ill
9 664 
9 665    Bard. Away you Rogue
9 666 
9 667    Host. By my troth he'l yeeld the Crow a pudding one
9 668 of these dayes: the King has kild his heart. Good Husband
9 669 come home presently.
9 670 
9 671 Exit
9 672 
9 673   Bar. Come, shall I make you two friends. Wee must
9 674 to France together: why the diuel should we keep kniues
9 675 to cut one anothers throats?
9 676   Pist. Let floods ore-swell, and fiends for food howle
9 677 on
9 678 
9 679    Nym. You'l pay me the eight shillings I won of you
9 680 at Betting?
9 681   Pist. Base is the Slaue that payes
9 682 
9 683    Nym. That now I wil haue: that's the humor of it
9 684 
9 685    Pist. As manhood shal compound: push home.
9 686 
9 687 Draw
9 688 
9 689   Bard. By this sword, hee that makes the first thrust,
9 690 Ile kill him: By this sword, I wil
9 691 
9 692    Pi. Sword is an Oath, & Oaths must haue their course
9 693   Bar. Coporall Nym, & thou wilt be friends be frends,
9 694 and thou wilt not, why then be enemies with me to: prethee
9 695 put vp
9 696 
9 697    Pist. A Noble shalt thou haue, and present pay, and
9 698 Liquor likewise will I giue to thee, and friendshippe
9 699 shall combyne, and brotherhood. Ile liue by Nymme, &
9 700 Nymme shall liue by me, is not this iust? For I shal Sutler
9 701 be vnto the Campe, and profits will accrue. Giue mee
9 702 thy hand
9 703 
9 704    Nym. I shall haue my Noble?
9 705   Pist. In cash, most iustly payd
9 706 
9 707    Nym. Well, then that the humor of't.
9 708 Enter Hostesse.
9 709 
9 710   Host. As euer you come of women, come in quickly
9 711 to sir Iohn: A poore heart, hee is so shak'd of a burning
9 712 quotidian Tertian, that it is most lamentable to behold.
9 713 Sweet men, come to him
9 714 
9 715    Nym. The King hath run bad humors on the Knight,
9 716 that's the euen of it
9 717 
9 718    Pist. Nym, thou hast spoke the right, his heart is fracted
9 719 and corroborate
9 720 
9 721    Nym. The King is a good King, but it must bee as it
9 722 may: he passes some humors, and carreeres
9 723 
9 724    Pist. Let vs condole the Knight, for (Lambekins) we
9 725 will liue.
9 726 Enter Exeter, Bedford, & Westmerland.
9 727 
9 728   Bed. Fore God his Grace is bold to trust these traitors
9 729   Exe. They shall be apprehended by and by
9 730 
9 731    West. How smooth and euen they do bear themselues,
9 732 As if allegeance in their bosomes sate
9 733 Crowned with faith, and constant loyalty
9 734 
9 735    Bed. The King hath note of all that they intend,
9 736 By interception, which they dreame not of
9 737 
9 738    Exe. Nay, but the man that was his bedfellow,
9 739 Whom he hath dull'd and cloy'd with gracious fauours;
9 740 That he should for a forraigne purse, so sell
9 741 His Soueraignes life to death and treachery.
9 742 
9 743 Sound Trumpets.
9 744 
9 745 Enter the King, Scroope, Cambridge, and Gray.
9 746 
9 747   King. Now sits the winde faire, and we will aboord.
9 748 My Lord of Cambridge, and my kinde Lord of Masham,
9 749 And you my gentle Knight, giue me your thoughts:
9 750 Thinke you not that the powres we beare with vs
9 751 Will cut their passage through the force of France?
9 752 Doing the execution, and the acte,
9 753 For which we haue in head assembled them
9 754 
9 755    Scro. No doubt my Liege, if each man do his best
9 756 
9 757    King. I doubt not that, since we are well perswaded
9 758 We carry not a heart with vs from hence,
9 759 That growes not in a faire consent with ours:
9 760 Nor leaue not one behinde, that doth not wish
9 761 Successe and Conquest to attend on vs
9 762 
9 763    Cam. Neuer was Monarch better fear'd and lou'd,
9 764 Then is your Maiesty; there's not I thinke a subiect
9 765 That sits in heart-greefe and vneasinesse
9 766 Vnder the sweet shade of your gouernment
9 767 
9 768    Kni. True: those that were your Fathers enemies,
9 769 Haue steep'd their gauls in hony, and do serue you
9 770 With hearts create of duty, and of zeale
9 771 
9 772    King. We therefore haue great cause of thankfulnes,
9 773 And shall forget the office of our hand
9 774 Sooner then quittance of desert and merit,
9 775 According to the weight and worthinesse
9 776 
9 777    Scro. So seruice shall with steeled sinewes toyle,
9 778 And labour shall refresh it selfe with hope
9 779 To do your Grace incessant seruices
9 780 
9 781    King. We Iudge no lesse. Vnkle of Exeter,
9 782 Inlarge the man committed yesterday,
9 783 That rayl'd against our person: We consider
9 784 It was excesse of Wine that set him on,
9 785 And on his more aduice, We pardon him
9 786 
9 787    Scro. That's mercy, but too much security:
9 788 Let him be punish'd Soueraigne, least example
9 789 Breed (by his sufferance) more of such a kind
9 790 
9 791    King. O let vs yet be mercifull
9 792 
9 793    Cam. So may your Highnesse, and yet punish too
9 794 
9 795    Grey. Sir, you shew great mercy if you giue him life,
9 796 After the taste of much correction
9 797 
9 798    King. Alas, your too much loue and care of me,
9 799 Are heauy Orisons 'gainst this poore wretch:
9 800 If little faults proceeding on distemper,
9 801 Shall not be wink'd at, how shall we stretch our eye
9 802 When capitall crimes, chew'd, swallow'd, and digested,
9 803 Appeare before vs? Wee'l yet inlarge that man,
9 804 Though Cambridge, Scroope, and Gray, in their deere care
9 805 And tender preseruation of our person
9 806 Wold haue him punish'd. And now to our French causes,
9 807 Who are the late Commissioners?
9 808   Cam. I one my Lord,
9 809 Your Highnesse bad me aske for it to day
9 810 
9 811    Scro. So did you me my Liege
9 812 
9 813    Gray. And I my Royall Soueraigne
9 814 
9 815    King. Then Richard Earle of Cambridge, there is yours:
9 816 There yours Lord Scroope of Masham, and Sir Knight:
9 817 Gray of Northumberland, this same is yours:
9 818 Reade them, and know I know your worthinesse.
9 819 My Lord of Westmerland, and Vnkle Exeter,
9 820 We will aboord to night. Why how now Gentlemen?
9 821 What see you in those papers, that you loose
9 822 So much complexion? Looke ye how they change:
9 823 Their cheekes are paper. Why, what reade you there,
9 824 That haue so cowarded and chac'd your blood
9 825 Out of apparance
9 826 
9 827    Cam. I do confesse my fault,
9 828 And do submit me to your Highnesse mercy
9 829 
9 830    Gray. Scro. To which we all appeale
9 831 
9 832    King. The mercy that was quicke in vs but late,
9 833 By your owne counsaile is supprest and kill'd:
9 834 You must not dare (for shame) to talke of mercy,
9 835 For your owne reasons turne into your bosomes,
9 836 As dogs vpon their maisters, worrying you:
9 837 See you my Princes, and my Noble Peeres,
9 838 These English monsters: My Lord of Cambridge heere,
9 839 You know how apt our loue was, to accord
9 840 To furnish with all appertinents
9 841 Belonging to his Honour; and this man,
9 842 Hath for a few light Crownes, lightly conspir'd
9 843 And sworne vnto the practises of France
9 844 To kill vs heere in Hampton. To the which,
9 845 This Knight no lesse for bounty bound to Vs
9 846 Then Cambridge is, hath likewise sworne. But O,
9 847 What shall I say to thee Lord Scroope, thou cruell,
9 848 Ingratefull, sauage, and inhumane Creature?
9 849 Thou that didst beare the key of all my counsailes,
9 850 That knew'st the very bottome of my soule,
9 851 That (almost) might'st haue coyn'd me into Golde,
9 852 Would'st thou haue practis'd on me, for thy vse?
9 853 May it be possible, that forraigne hyer
9 854 Could out of thee extract one sparke of euill
9 855 That might annoy my finger? 'Tis so strange,
9 856 That though the truth of it stands off as grosse
9 857 As black and white, my eye will scarsely see it.
9 858 Treason, and murther, euer kept together,
9 859 As two yoake diuels sworne to eythers purpose,
9 860 Working so grossely in an naturall cause,
9 861 That admiration did not hoope at them.
9 862 But thou (gainst all proportion) didst bring in
9 863 Wonder to waite on treason, and on murther:
9 864 And whatsoeuer cunning fiend it was
9 865 That wrought vpon thee so preposterously,
9 866 Hath got the voyce in hell for excellence:
9 867 And other diuels that suggest by treasons,
9 868 Do botch and bungle vp damnation,
9 869 With patches, colours, and with formes being fetcht
9 870 From glist'ring semblances of piety:
9 871 But he that temper'd thee, bad thee stand vp,
9 872 Gaue thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason,
9 873 Vnlesse to dub thee with the name of Traitor.
9 874 If that same Daemon that hath gull'd thee thus,
9 875 Should with his Lyon-gate walke the whole world,
9 876 He might returne to vastie Tartar backe,
9 877 And tell the Legions, I can neuer win
9 878 A soule so easie as that Englishmans.
9 879 Oh, how hast thou with iealousie infected
9 880 The sweetnesse of affiance? Shew men dutifull,
9 881 Why so didst thou: seeme they graue and learned?
9 882 Why so didst thou. Come they of Noble Family?
9 883 Why so didst thou. Seeme they religious?
9 884 Why so didst thou. Or are they spare in diet,
9 885 Free from grosse passion, or of mirth, or anger,
9 886 Constant in spirit, not sweruing with the blood,
9 887 Garnish'd and deck'd in modest complement,
9 888 Not working with the eye, without the eare,
9 889 And but in purged iudgement trusting neither,
9 890 Such and so finely boulted didst thou seeme:
9 891 And thus thy fall hath left a kinde of blot,
9 892 To make thee full fraught man, and best indued
9 893 With some suspition, I will weepe for thee.
9 894 For this reuolt of thine, me thinkes is like
9 895 Another fall of Man. Their faults are open,
9 896 Arrest them to the answer of the Law,
9 897 And God acquit them of their practises
9 898 
9 899    Exe. I arrest thee of High Treason, by the name of
9 900 Richard Earle of Cambridge.
9 901 I arrest thee of High Treason, by the name of Thomas
9 902 Lord Scroope of Marsham.
9 903 I arrest thee of High Treason, by the name of Thomas
9 904 Grey, Knight of Northumberland
9 905 
9 906    Scro. Our purposes, God iustly hath discouer'd,
9 907 And I repent my fault more then my death,
9 908 Which I beseech your Highnesse to forgiue,
9 909 Although my body pay the price of it
9 910 
9 911    Cam. For me, the Gold of France did not seduce,
9 912 Although I did admit it as a motiue,
9 913 The sooner to effect what I intended:
9 914 But God be thanked for preuention,
9 915 Which in sufferance heartily will reioyce,
9 916 Beseeching God, and you, to pardon mee
9 917 
9 918    Gray. Neuer did faithfull subiect more reioyce
9 919 At the discouery of most dangerous Treason,
9 920 Then I do at this houre ioy ore my selfe,
9 921 Preuented from a damned enterprize;
9 922 My fault, but not my body, pardon Soueraigne
9 923 
9 924    King. God quit you in his mercy: Hear your sentence
9 925 You haue conspir'd against Our Royall person,
9 926 Ioyn'd with an enemy proclaim'd, and from his Coffers,
9 927 Receyu'd the Golden Earnest of Our death:
9 928 Wherein you would haue sold your King to slaughter,
9 929 His Princes, and his Peeres to seruitude,
9 930 His Subiects to oppression, and contempt,
9 931 And his whole Kingdome into desolation:
9 932 Touching our person, seeke we no reuenge,
9 933 But we our Kingdomes safety must so tender,
9 934 Whose ruine you sought, that to her Lawes
9 935 We do deliuer you. Get you therefore hence,
9 936 (Poore miserable wretches) to your death:
9 937 The taste whereof, God of his mercy giue
9 938 You patience to indure, and true Repentance
9 939 Of all your deare offences. Beare them hence.
9 940 Enter.
9 941 
9 942 Now Lords for France: the enterprise whereof
9 943 Shall be to you as vs, like glorious.
9 944 We doubt not of a faire and luckie Warre,
9 945 Since God so graciously hath brought to light
9 946 This dangerous Treason, lurking in our way,
9 947 To hinder our beginnings. We doubt not now,
9 948 But euery Rubbe is smoothed on our way.
9 949 Then forth, deare Countreymen: Let vs deliuer
9 950 Our Puissance into the hand of God,
9 951 Putting it straight in expedition.
9 952 Chearely to Sea, the signes of Warre aduance,
9 953 No King of England, if not King of France.
9 954 
9 955 Flourish.
9 956 
9 957 Enter Pistoll, Nim, Bardolph, Boy, and Hostesse.
9 958 
9 959   Hostesse. 'Prythee honey sweet Husband, let me bring
9 960 thee to Staines
9 961 
9 962    Pistoll. No: for my manly heart doth erne. Bardolph,
9 963 be blythe: Nim, rowse thy vaunting Veines: Boy, brissle
9 964 thy Courage vp: for Falstaffe hee is dead, and wee must
9 965 erne therefore
9 966 
9 967    Bard. Would I were with him, wheresomere hee is,
9 968 eyther in Heauen, or in Hell
9 969 
9 970    Hostesse. Nay sure, hee's not in Hell: hee's in Arthurs
9 971 Bosome, if euer man went to Arthurs Bosome: a made a
9 972 finer end, and went away and it had beene any Christome
9 973 Childe: a parted eu'n iust betweene Twelue and One, eu'n
9 974 at the turning o'th' Tyde: for after I saw him fumble with
9 975 the Sheets, and play with Flowers, and smile vpon his fingers
9 976 end, I knew there was but one way: for his Nose was
9 977 as sharpe as a Pen, and a Table of greene fields. How now
9 978 Sir Iohn (quoth I?) what man? be a good cheare: so a
9 979 cryed out, God, God, God, three or foure times: now I,
9 980 to comfort him, bid him a should not thinke of God; I
9 981 hop'd there was no neede to trouble himselfe with any
9 982 such thoughts yet: so a bad me lay more Clothes on his
9 983 feet: I put my hand into the Bed, and felt them, and they
9 984 were as cold as any stone: then I felt to his knees, and so
9 985 vp-peer'd, and vpward, and all was as cold as any stone
9 986 
9 987    Nim. They say he cryed out of Sack
9 988 
9 989    Hostesse. I, that a did
9 990 
9 991    Bard. And of Women
9 992 
9 993    Hostesse. Nay, that a did not
9 994 
9 995    Boy. Yes that a did, and said they were Deules incarnate
9 996 
9 997    Woman. A could neuer abide Carnation, 'twas a Colour
9 998 he neuer lik'd
9 999 
9 1000    Boy. A said once, the Deule would haue him about
9 1001 Women
9 1002 
9 1003    Hostesse. A did in some sort (indeed) handle Women:
9 1004 but then hee was rumatique, and talk'd of the Whore of
9 1005 Babylon
9 1006 
9 1007    Boy. Doe you not remember a saw a Flea sticke vpon
9 1008 Bardolphs Nose, and a said it was a blacke Soule burning
9 1009 in Hell
9 1010 
9 1011    Bard. Well, the fuell is gone that maintain'd that fire:
9 1012 that's all the Riches I got in his seruice
9 1013 
9 1014    Nim. Shall wee shogg? the King will be gone from
9 1015 Southampton
9 1016 
9 1017    Pist. Come, let's away. My Loue, giue me thy Lippes:
9 1018 Looke to my Chattels, and my Moueables: Let Sences
9 1019 rule: The world is, Pitch and pay: trust none: for Oathes
9 1020 are Strawes, mens Faiths are Wafer-Cakes, and hold-fast
9 1021 is the onely Dogge: My Ducke, therefore Caueto bee
9 1022 thy Counsailor. Goe, cleare thy Chrystalls. Yokefellowes
9 1023 in Armes, let vs to France, like Horseleeches
9 1024 my Boyes, to sucke, to sucke, the very blood to
9 1025 sucke
9 1026 
9 1027    Boy. And that's but vnwholesome food, they say
9 1028 
9 1029    Pist. Touch her soft mouth, and march
9 1030 
9 1031    Bard. Farwell Hostesse
9 1032 
9 1033    Nim. I cannot kisse, that is the humor of it: but
9 1034 adieu
9 1035 
9 1036    Pist. Let Huswiferie appeare: keepe close, I thee
9 1037 command
9 1038 
9 1039    Hostesse. Farwell: adieu.
9 1040 
9 1041 Exeunt.
9 1042 
9 1043 Flourish.
9 1044 
9 1045 Enter the French King, the Dolphin, the Dukes of Berry and
9 1046 Britaine.
9 1047 
9 1048   King. Thus comes the English with full power vpon vs,
9 1049 And more then carefully it vs concernes,
9 1050 To answer Royally in our defences.
9 1051 Therefore the Dukes of Berry and of Britaine,
9 1052 Of Brabant and of Orleance, shall make forth,
9 1053 And you Prince Dolphin, with all swift dispatch
9 1054 To lyne and new repayre our Townes of Warre
9 1055 With men of courage, and with meanes defendant:
9 1056 For England his approaches makes as fierce,
9 1057 As Waters to the sucking of a Gulfe.
9 1058 It fits vs then to be as prouident,
9 1059 As feare may teach vs, out of late examples
9 1060 Left by the fatall and neglected English,
9 1061 Vpon our fields
9 1062 
9 1063    Dolphin. My most redoubted Father,
9 1064 It is most meet we arme vs 'gainst the Foe:
9 1065 For Peace it selfe should not so dull a Kingdome,
9 1066 (Though War nor no knowne Quarrel were in question)
9 1067 But that Defences, Musters, Preparations,
9 1068 Should be maintain'd, assembled, and collected,
9 1069 As were a Warre in expectation.
9 1070 Therefore I say, 'tis meet we all goe forth,
9 1071 To view the sick and feeble parts of France:
9 1072 And let vs doe it with no shew of feare,
9 1073 No, with no more, then if we heard that England
9 1074 Were busied with a Whitson Morris-dance:
9 1075 For, my good Liege, shee is so idly King'd,
9 1076 Her Scepter so phantastically borne,
9 1077 By a vaine giddie shallow humorous Youth,
9 1078 That feare attends her not
9 1079 
9 1080    Const. O peace, Prince Dolphin,
9 1081 You are too much mistaken in this King:
9 1082 Question your Grace the late Embassadors,
9 1083 With what great State he heard their Embassie,
9 1084 How well supply'd with Noble Councellors,
9 1085 How modest in exception; and withall,
9 1086 How terrible in constant resolution:
9 1087 And you shall find, his Vanities fore-spent,
9 1088 Were but the out-side of the Roman Brutus,
9 1089 Couering Discretion with a Coat of Folly;
9 1090 As Gardeners doe with Ordure hide those Roots
9 1091 That shall first spring, and be most delicate
9 1092 
9 1093    Dolphin. Well, 'tis not so, my Lord High Constable.
9 1094 But though we thinke it so, it is no matter:
9 1095 In cases of defence, 'tis best to weigh
9 1096 The Enemie more mightie then he seemes,
9 1097 So the proportions of defence are fill'd:
9 1098 Which of a weake and niggardly proiection,
9 1099 Doth like a Miser spoyle his Coat, with scanting
9 1100 A little Cloth
9 1101 
9 1102    King. Thinke we King Harry strong:
9 1103 And Princes, looke you strongly arme to meet him.
9 1104 The Kindred of him hath beene flesht vpon vs:
9 1105 And he is bred out of that bloodie straine,
9 1106 That haunted vs in our familiar Pathes:
9 1107 Witnesse our too much memorable shame,
9 1108 When Cressy Battell fatally was strucke,
9 1109 And all our Princes captiu'd, by the hand
9 1110 Of that black Name, Edward, black Prince of Wales:
9 1111 Whiles that his Mountaine Sire, on Mountaine standing
9 1112 Vp in the Ayre, crown'd with the Golden Sunne,
9 1113 Saw his Heroicall Seed, and smil'd to see him
9 1114 Mangle the Worke of Nature, and deface
9 1115 The Patternes, that by God and by French Fathers
9 1116 Had twentie yeeres been made. This is a Stem
9 1117 Of that Victorious Stock: and let vs feare
9 1118 The Natiue mightinesse and fate of him.
9 1119 Enter a Messenger.
9 1120 
9 1121   Mess. Embassadors from Harry King of England,
9 1122 Doe craue admittance to your Maiestie
9 1123 
9 1124    King. Weele giue them present audience.
9 1125 Goe, and bring them.
9 1126 You see this Chase is hotly followed, friends
9 1127 
9 1128    Dolphin. Turne head, and stop pursuit: for coward Dogs
9 1129 Most spend their mouths, whe[n] what they seem to threaten
9 1130 Runs farre before them. Good my Soueraigne
9 1131 Take vp the English short, and let them know
9 1132 Of what a Monarchie you are the Head:
9 1133 Selfe-loue, my Liege, is not so vile a sinne,
9 1134 As selfe-neglecting.
9 1135 Enter Exeter.
9 1136 
9 1137   King. From our Brother of England?
9 1138   Exe. From him, and thus he greets your Maiestie:
9 1139 He wills you in the Name of God Almightie,
9 1140 That you deuest your selfe, and lay apart
9 1141 The borrowed Glories, that by gift of Heauen,
9 1142 By Law of Nature, and of Nations, longs
9 1143 To him and to his Heires, namely, the Crowne,
9 1144 And all wide-stretched Honors, that pertaine
9 1145 By Custome, and the Ordinance of Times,
9 1146 Vnto the Crowne of France: that you may know
9 1147 'Tis no sinister, nor no awkward Clayme,
9 1148 Pickt from the worme-holes of long-vanisht dayes,
9 1149 Nor from the dust of old Obliuion rakt,
9 1150 He sends you this most memorable Lyne,
9 1151 In euery Branch truly demonstratiue;
9 1152 Willing you ouer-looke this Pedigree:
9 1153 And when you find him euenly deriu'd
9 1154 From his most fam'd, of famous Ancestors,
9 1155 Edward the third; he bids you then resigne
9 1156 Your Crowne and Kingdome, indirectly held
9 1157 From him, the Natiue and true Challenger
9 1158 
9 1159    King. Or else what followes?
9 1160   Exe. Bloody constraint: for if you hide the Crowne
9 1161 Euen in your hearts, there will he rake for it.
9 1162 Therefore in fierce Tempest is he comming,
9 1163 In Thunder and in Earth-quake, like a Ioue:
9 1164 That if requiring faile, he will compell.
9 1165 And bids you, in the Bowels of the Lord,
9 1166 Deliuer vp the Crowne, and to take mercie
9 1167 On the poore Soules, for whom this hungry Warre
9 1168 Opens his vastie Iawes: and on your head
9 1169 Turning the Widdowes Teares, the Orphans Cryes,
9 1170 The dead-mens Blood, the priuy Maidens Groanes,
9 1171 For Husbands, Fathers, and betrothed Louers,
9 1172 That shall be swallowed in this Controuersie.
9 1173 This is his Clayme, his Threatning, and my Message:
9 1174 Vnlesse the Dolphin be in presence here;
9 1175 To whom expressely I bring greeting to
9 1176 
9 1177    King. For vs, we will consider of this further:
9 1178 To morrow shall you beare our full intent
9 1179 Back to our Brother of England
9 1180 
9 1181    Dolph. For the Dolphin,
9 1182 I stand here for him: what to him from England?
9 1183   Exe. Scorne and defiance, sleight regard, contempt,
9 1184 And any thing that may not mis-become
9 1185 The mightie Sender, doth he prize you at.
9 1186 Thus sayes my King: and if your Fathers Highnesse
9 1187 Doe not, in graunt of all demands at large,
9 1188 Sweeten the bitter Mock you sent his Maiestie;
9 1189 Hee'le call you to so hot an Answer of it,
9 1190 That Caues and Wombie Vaultages of France
9 1191 Shall chide your Trespas, and returne your Mock
9 1192 In second Accent of his Ordinance
9 1193 
9 1194    Dolph. Say: if my Father render faire returne,
9 1195 It is against my will: for I desire
9 1196 Nothing but Oddes with England.
9 1197 To that end, as matching to his Youth and Vanitie,
9 1198 I did present him with the Paris-Balls
9 1199 
9 1200    Exe. Hee'le make your Paris Louer shake for it,
9 1201 Were it the Mistresse Court of mightie Europe:
9 1202 And be assur'd, you'le find a diff'rence,
9 1203 As we his Subiects haue in wonder found,
9 1204 Betweene the promise of his greener dayes,
9 1205 And these he masters now: now he weighes Time
9 1206 Euen to the vtmost Graine: that you shall reade
9 1207 In your owne Losses, if he stay in France
9 1208 
9 1209    King. To morrow shall you know our mind at full.
9 1210 
9 1211 Flourish.
9 1212 
9 1213   Exe. Dispatch vs with all speed, least that our King
9 1214 Come here himselfe to question our delay;
9 1215 For he is footed in this Land already
9 1216 
9 1217    King. You shalbe soone dispatcht, with faire conditions.
9 1218 A Night is but small breathe, and little pawse,
9 1219 To answer matters of this consequence.
9 1220 
9 1221 Exeunt.
9 1222 
9 1223 
9 1224 Actus Secundus.
9 1225 
9 1226 Flourish. Enter Chorus.
9 1227 
9 1228 Thus with imagin'd wing our swift Scene flyes,
9 1229 In motion of no lesse celeritie then that of Thought.
9 1230 Suppose, that you haue seene
9 1231 The well-appointed King at Douer Peer,
9 1232 Embarke his Royaltie: and his braue Fleet,
9 1233 With silken Streamers, the young Phebus fayning;
9 1234 Play with your Fancies: and in them behold,
9 1235 Vpon the Hempen Tackle, Ship-boyes climbing;
9 1236 Heare the shrill Whistle, which doth order giue
9 1237 To sounds confus'd: behold the threaden Sayles,
9 1238 Borne with th' inuisible and creeping Wind,
9 1239 Draw the huge Bottomes through the furrowed Sea,
9 1240 Bresting the loftie Surge. O, doe but thinke
9 1241 You stand vpon the Riuage, and behold
9 1242 A Citie on th' inconstant Billowes dauncing:
9 1243 For so appeares this Fleet Maiesticall,
9 1244 Holding due course to Harflew. Follow, follow:
9 1245 Grapple your minds to sternage of this Nauie,
9 1246 And leaue your England as dead Mid-night, still,
9 1247 Guarded with Grandsires, Babyes, and old Women,
9 1248 Eyther past, or not arriu'd to pyth and puissance:
9 1249 For who is he, whose Chin is but enricht
9 1250 With one appearing Hayre, that will not follow
9 1251 These cull'd and choyse-drawne Caualiers to France?
9 1252 Worke, worke your Thoughts, and therein see a Siege:
9 1253 Behold the Ordenance on their Carriages,
9 1254 With fatall mouthes gaping on girded Harflew.
9 1255 Suppose th' Embassador from the French comes back:
9 1256 Tells Harry, That the King doth offer him
9 1257 Katherine his Daughter, and with her to Dowrie,
9 1258 Some petty and vnprofitable Dukedomes.
9 1259 The offer likes not: and the nimble Gunner
9 1260 With Lynstock now the diuellish Cannon touches,
9 1261 
9 1262 Alarum, and Chambers goe off.
9 1263 
9 1264 And downe goes all before them. Still be kind,
9 1265 And eech out our performance with your mind.
9 1266 Enter.
9 1267 
9 1268 Enter the King, Exeter, Bedford, and Gloucester. Alarum: Scaling
9 1269 Ladders
9 1270 at Harflew.
9 1271 
9 1272   King. Once more vnto the Breach,
9 1273 Deare friends, once more;
9 1274 Or close the Wall vp with our English dead:
9 1275 In Peace, there's nothing so becomes a man,
9 1276 As modest stillnesse, and humilitie:
9 1277 But when the blast of Warre blowes in our eares,
9 1278 Then imitate the action of the Tyger:
9 1279 Stiffen the sinewes, commune vp the blood,
9 1280 Disguise faire Nature with hard-fauour'd Rage:
9 1281 Then lend the Eye a terrible aspect:
9 1282 Let it pry through the portage of the Head,
9 1283 Like the Brasse Cannon: let the Brow o'rewhelme it,
9 1284 As fearefully, as doth a galled Rocke
9 1285 O're-hang and iutty his confounded Base,
9 1286 Swill'd with the wild and wastfull Ocean.
9 1287 Now set the Teeth, and stretch the Nosthrill wide,
9 1288 Hold hard the Breath, and bend vp euery Spirit
9 1289 To his full height. On, on, you Noblish English,
9 1290 Whose blood is fet from Fathers of Warre-proofe:
9 1291 Fathers, that like so many Alexanders,
9 1292 Haue in these parts from Morne till Euen fought,
9 1293 And sheath'd their Swords, for lack of argument.
9 1294 Dishonour not your Mothers: now attest,
9 1295 That those whom you call'd Fathers, did beget you.
9 1296 Be Coppy now to men of grosser blood,
9 1297 And teach them how to Warre. And you good Yeomen,
9 1298 Whose Lyms were made in England; shew vs here
9 1299 The mettell of your Pasture: let vs sweare,
9 1300 That you are worth your breeding: which I doubt not:
9 1301 For there is none of you so meane and base,
9 1302 That hath not Noble luster in your eyes.
9 1303 I see you stand like Grey-hounds in the slips,
9 1304 Straying vpon the Start. The Game's afoot:
9 1305 Follow your Spirit; and vpon this Charge,
9 1306 Cry, God for Harry, England, and S[aint]. George.
9 1307 
9 1308 Alarum, and Chambers goe off.
9 1309 
9 1310 Enter Nim, Bardolph, Pistoll, and Boy.
9 1311 
9 1312   Bard. On, on, on, on, on, to the breach, to the breach
9 1313 
9 1314    Nim. 'Pray thee Corporall stay, the Knocks are too
9 1315 hot: and for mine owne part, I haue not a Case of Liues:
9 1316 the humor of it is too hot, that is the very plaine-Song
9 1317 of it
9 1318 
9 1319    Pist. The plaine-Song is most iust: for humors doe abound:
9 1320 Knocks goe and come: Gods Vassals drop and
9 1321 dye: and Sword and Shield, in bloody Field, doth winne
9 1322 immortall fame
9 1323 
9 1324    Boy. Would I were in a Ale-house in London, I
9 1325 would giue all my fame for a Pot of Ale, and safetie
9 1326 
9 1327    Pist. And I: If wishes would preuayle with me, my
9 1328 purpose should not fayle with me; but thither would I
9 1329 high
9 1330 
9 1331    Boy. As duly, but not as truly, as Bird doth sing on
9 1332 bough.
9 1333 Enter Fluellen.
9 1334 
9 1335   Flu. Vp to the breach, you Dogges; auaunt you
9 1336 Cullions
9 1337 
9 1338    Pist. Be mercifull great Duke to men of Mould: abate
9 1339 thy Rage, abate thy manly Rage; abate thy Rage,
9 1340 great Duke. Good Bawcock bate thy Rage: vse lenitie
9 1341 sweet Chuck
9 1342 
9 1343    Nim. These be good humors: your Honor wins bad
9 1344 humors.
9 1345 Enter.
9 1346 
9 1347   Boy. As young as I am, I haue obseru'd these three
9 1348 Swashers: I am Boy to them all three, but all they three,
9 1349 though they would serue me, could not be Man to me;
9 1350 for indeed three such Antiques doe not amount to a man:
9 1351 for Bardolph, hee is white-liuer'd, and red-fac'd; by the
9 1352 meanes whereof, a faces it out, but fights not: for Pistoll,
9 1353 hee hath a killing Tongue, and a quiet Sword; by the
9 1354 meanes whereof, a breakes Words, and keepes whole
9 1355 Weapons: for Nim, hee hath heard, that men of few
9 1356 Words are the best men, and therefore hee scornes to say
9 1357 his Prayers, lest a should be thought a Coward: but his
9 1358 few bad Words are matcht with as few good Deeds; for
9 1359 a neuer broke any mans Head but his owne, and that was
9 1360 against a Post, when he was drunke. They will steale any
9 1361 thing, and call it Purchase. Bardolph stole a Lute-case,
9 1362 bore it twelue Leagues, and sold it for three halfepence.
9 1363 Nim and Bardolph are sworne Brothers in filching: and
9 1364 in Callice they stole a fire-shouell. I knew by that peece
9 1365 of Seruice, the men would carry Coales. They would
9 1366 haue me as familiar with mens Pockets, as their Gloues
9 1367 or their Hand-kerchers: which makes much against my
9 1368 Manhood, if I should take from anothers Pocket, to put
9 1369 into mine; for it is plaine pocketting vp of Wrongs.
9 1370 I must leaue them, and seeke some better Seruice: their
9 1371 Villany goes against my weake stomacke, and therefore
9 1372 I must cast it vp.
9 1373 Enter.
9 1374 
9 1375 Enter Gower.
9 1376 
9 1377   Gower. Captaine Fluellen, you must come presently to
9 1378 the Mynes; the Duke of Gloucester would speake with
9 1379 you
9 1380 
9 1381    Flu. To the Mynes? Tell you the Duke, it is not so
9 1382 good to come to the Mynes: for looke you, the Mynes
9 1383 is not according to the disciplines of the Warre; the concauities
9 1384 of it is not sufficient: for looke you, th' athuersarie,
9 1385 you may discusse vnto the Duke, looke you, is digt
9 1386 himselfe foure yard vnder the Countermines: by Cheshu,
9 1387 I thinke a will plowe vp all, if there is not better directions
9 1388 
9 1389    Gower. The Duke of Gloucester, to whom the Order
9 1390 of the Siege is giuen, is altogether directed by an Irish
9 1391 man, a very valiant Gentleman yfaith
9 1392 
9 1393    Welch. It is Captaine Makmorrice, is it not?
9 1394   Gower. I thinke it be
9 1395 
9 1396    Welch. By Cheshu he is an Asse, as in the World, I will
9 1397 verifie as much in his Beard: he ha's no more directions
9 1398 in the true disciplines of the Warres, looke you, of the
9 1399 Roman disciplines, then is a Puppy-dog.
9 1400 Enter Makmorrice, and Captaine Iamy.
9 1401 
9 1402   Gower. Here a comes, and the Scots Captaine, Captaine
9 1403 Iamy, with him
9 1404 
9 1405    Welch. Captaine Iamy is a maruellous falorous Gentleman,
9 1406 that is certain, and of great expedition and knowledge
9 1407 in th' aunchiant Warres, vpon my particular knowledge
9 1408 of his directions: by Cheshu he will maintaine his
9 1409 Argument as well as any Militarie man in the World, in
9 1410 the disciplines of the Pristine Warres of the Romans
9 1411 
9 1412    Scot. I say gudday, Captaine Fluellen
9 1413 
9 1414    Welch. Godden to your Worship, good Captaine
9 1415 Iames
9 1416 
9 1417    Gower. How now Captaine Mackmorrice, haue you
9 1418 quit the Mynes? haue the Pioners giuen o're?
9 1419   Irish. By Chrish Law tish ill done: the Worke ish
9 1420 giue ouer, the Trompet sound the Retreat. By my Hand
9 1421 I sweare, and my fathers Soule, the Worke ish ill done:
9 1422 it ish giue ouer: I would haue blowed vp the Towne,
9 1423 so Chrish saue me law, in an houre. O tish ill done, tish ill
9 1424 done: by my Hand tish ill done
9 1425 
9 1426    Welch. Captaine Mackmorrice, I beseech you now,
9 1427 will you voutsafe me, looke you, a few disputations with
9 1428 you, as partly touching or concerning the disciplines of
9 1429 the Warre, the Roman Warres, in the way of Argument,
9 1430 looke you, and friendly communication: partly to satisfie
9 1431 my Opinion, and partly for the satisfaction, looke you, of
9 1432 my Mind: as touching the direction of the Militarie discipline,
9 1433 that is the Point
9 1434 
9 1435    Scot. It sall be vary gud, gud feith, gud Captens bath,
9 1436 and I sall quit you with gud leue, as I may pick occasion:
9 1437 that sall I mary
9 1438 
9 1439    Irish. It is no time to discourse, so Chrish saue me:
9 1440 the day is hot, and the Weather, and the Warres, and the
9 1441 King, and the Dukes: it is no time to discourse, the Town
9 1442 is beseech'd: and the Trumpet call vs to the breech, and
9 1443 we talke, and be Chrish do nothing, tis shame for vs all:
9 1444 so God sa'me tis shame to stand still, it is shame by my
9 1445 hand: and there is Throats to be cut, and Workes to be
9 1446 done, and there ish nothing done, so Christ sa'me law
9 1447 
9 1448    Scot. By the Mes, ere theise eyes of mine take themselues
9 1449 to slomber, ayle de gud seruice, or Ile ligge i'th'
9 1450 grund for it; ay, or goe to death: and Ile pay't as valorously
9 1451 as I may, that sal I suerly do, that is the breff and
9 1452 the long: mary, I wad full faine heard some question
9 1453 tween you tway
9 1454 
9 1455    Welch. Captaine Mackmorrice, I thinke, looke you,
9 1456 vnder your correction, there is not many of your Nation
9 1457 
9 1458    Irish. Of my Nation? What ish my Nation? Ish a
9 1459 Villaine, and a Basterd, and a Knaue, and a Rascall. What
9 1460 ish my Nation? Who talkes of my Nation?
9 1461   Welch. Looke you, if you take the matter otherwise
9 1462 then is meant, Captaine Mackmorrice, peraduenture I
9 1463 shall thinke you doe not vse me with that affabilitie, as in
9 1464 discretion you ought to vse me, looke you, being as good
9 1465 a man as your selfe, both in the disciplines of Warre, and
9 1466 in the deriuation of my Birth, and in other particularities
9 1467 
9 1468    Irish. I doe not know you so good a man as my selfe:
9 1469 so Chrish saue me, I will cut off your Head
9 1470 
9 1471    Gower. Gentlemen both, you will mistake each other
9 1472 
9 1473    Scot. A, that's a foule fault.
9 1474 
9 1475 A Parley.
9 1476 
9 1477   Gower. The Towne sounds a Parley
9 1478 
9 1479    Welch. Captaine Mackmorrice, when there is more
9 1480 better oportunitie to be required, looke you, I will be
9 1481 so bold as to tell you, I know the disciplines of Warre:
9 1482 and there is an end.
9 1483 Enter.
9 1484 
9 1485 Enter the King and all his Traine before the Gates.
9 1486 
9 1487   King. How yet resolues the Gouernour of the Towne?
9 1488 This is the latest Parle we will admit:
9 1489 Therefore to our best mercy giue your selues,
9 1490 Or like to men prowd of destruction,
9 1491 Defie vs to our worst: for as I am a Souldier,
9 1492 A Name that in my thoughts becomes me best;
9 1493 If I begin the batt'rie once againe,
9 1494 I will not leaue the halfe-atchieued Harflew,
9 1495 Till in her ashes she lye buryed.
9 1496 The Gates of Mercy shall be all shut vp,
9 1497 And the flesh'd Souldier, rough and hard of heart,
9 1498 In libertie of bloody hand, shall raunge
9 1499 With Conscience wide as Hell, mowing like Grasse
9 1500 Your fresh faire Virgins, and your flowring Infants.
9 1501 What is it then to me, if impious Warre,
9 1502 Arrayed in flames like to the Prince of Fiends,
9 1503 Doe with his smyrcht complexion all fell feats,
9 1504 Enlynckt to wast and desolation?
9 1505 What is't to me, when you your selues are cause,
9 1506 If your pure Maydens fall into the hand
9 1507 Of hot and forcing Violation?
9 1508 What Reyne can hold licentious Wickednesse,
9 1509 When downe the Hill he holds his fierce Carriere?
9 1510 We may as bootlesse spend our vaine Command
9 1511 Vpon th' enraged Souldiers in their spoyle,
9 1512 As send Precepts to the Leuiathan, to come ashore.
9 1513 Therefore, you men of Harflew,
9 1514 Take pitty of your Towne and of your People,
9 1515 Whiles yet my Souldiers are in my Command,
9 1516 Whiles yet the coole and temperate Wind of Grace
9 1517 O're-blowes the filthy and contagious Clouds
9 1518 Of heady Murther, Spoyle, and Villany.
9 1519 If not: why in a moment looke to see
9 1520 The blind and bloody Souldier, with foule hand
9 1521 Desire the Locks of your shrill-shriking Daughters:
9 1522 Your Fathers taken by the siluer Beards,
9 1523 And their most reuerend Heads dasht to the Walls:
9 1524 Your naked Infants spitted vpon Pykes,
9 1525 Whiles the mad Mothers, with their howles confus'd,
9 1526 Doe breake the Clouds; as did the Wiues of Iewry,
9 1527 At Herods bloody-hunting slaughter-men.
9 1528 What say you? Will you yeeld, and this auoyd?
9 1529 Or guiltie in defence, be thus destroy'd.
9 1530 Enter Gouernour.
9 1531 
9 1532   Gouer. Our expectation hath this day an end:
9 1533 The Dolphin, whom of Succours we entreated,
9 1534 Returnes vs, that his Powers are yet not ready,
9 1535 To rayse so great a Siege: Therefore great King,
9 1536 We yeeld our Towne and Liues to thy soft Mercy:
9 1537 Enter our Gates, dispose of vs and ours,
9 1538 For we no longer are defensible
9 1539 
9 1540    King. Open your Gates: Come Vnckle Exeter,
9 1541 Goe you and enter Harflew; there remaine,
9 1542 And fortifie it strongly 'gainst the French:
9 1543 Vse mercy to them all for vs, deare Vnckle.
9 1544 The Winter comming on, and Sicknesse growing
9 1545 Vpon our Souldiers, we will retyre to Calis.
9 1546 To night in Harflew will we be your Guest,
9 1547 To morrow for the March are we addrest.
9 1548 
9 1549 Flourish, and enter the Towne.
9 1550 
9 1551 Enter Katherine and an old Gentlewoman.

9 1643 Enter.
9 1644 
9 1645 Enter the King of France, the Dolphin, the Constable of France,
9 1646 and
9 1647 others.
9 1648 
9 1649   King. 'Tis certaine he hath past the Riuer Some
9 1650 
9 1651    Const. And if he be not fought withall, my Lord,
9 1652 Let vs not liue in France: let vs quit all,
9 1653 And giue our Vineyards to a barbarous People
9 1654 
9 1655    Dolph. O Dieu viuant: Shall a few Sprayes of vs,
9 1656 The emptying of our Fathers Luxurie,
9 1657 Our Syens, put in wilde and sauage Stock,
9 1658 Spirt vp so suddenly into the Clouds,
9 1659 And ouer-looke their Grafters?

9 1665 
9 1666    Const. Dieu de Battailes, where haue they this mettell?
9 1667 Is not their Clymate foggy, raw, and dull?
9 1668 On whom, as in despight, the Sunne lookes pale,
9 1669 Killing their Fruit with frownes. Can sodden Water,
9 1670 A Drench for sur-reyn'd Iades, their Barly broth,
9 1671 Decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat?
9 1672 And shall our quick blood, spirited with Wine,
9 1673 Seeme frostie? O, for honor of our Land,
9 1674 Let vs not hang like roping Isyckles
9 1675 Vpon our Houses Thatch, whiles a more frostie People
9 1676 Sweat drops of gallant Youth in our rich fields:
9 1677 Poore we call them, in their Natiue Lords
9 1678 
9 1679    Dolphin. By Faith and Honor,
9 1680 Our Madames mock at vs, and plainely say,
9 1681 Our Mettell is bred out, and they will giue
9 1682 Their bodyes to the Lust of English Youth,
9 1683 To new-store France with Bastard Warriors
9 1684 
9 1685    Brit. They bid vs to the English Dancing-Schooles,
9 1686 And teach Lauolta's high, and swift Carranto's,
9 1687 Saying, our Grace is onely in our Heeles,
9 1688 And that we are most loftie Run-awayes
9 1689 
9 1690    King. Where is Montioy the Herald? speed him hence,
9 1691 Let him greet England with our sharpe defiance.
9 1692 Vp Princes, and with spirit of Honor edged,
9 1693 More sharper then your Swords, high to the field:
9 1694 Charles Delabreth, High Constable of France,
9 1695 You Dukes of Orleance, Burbon, and of Berry,
9 1696 Alanson, Brabant, Bar, and Burgonie,
9 1697 Iaques Chattillion, Rambures, Vandemont,
9 1698 Beumont, Grand Pree, Roussi, and Faulconbridge,
9 1699 Loys, Lestrale, Bouciquall, and Charaloyes,
9 1700 High Dukes, great Princes, Barons, Lords, and Kings;
9 1701 For your great Seats, now quit you of great shames:
9 1702 Barre Harry England, that sweepes through our Land
9 1703 With Penons painted in the blood of Harflew:
9 1704 Rush on his Hoast, as doth the melted Snow
9 1705 Vpon the Valleyes, whose low Vassall Seat,
9 1706 The Alpes doth spit, and void his rhewme vpon.
9 1707 Goe downe vpon him, you haue Power enough,
9 1708 And in a Captiue Chariot, into Roan
9 1709 Bring him our Prisoner
9 1710 
9 1711    Const. This becomes the Great.
9 1712 Sorry am I his numbers are so few,
9 1713 His Souldiers sick, and famisht in their March:
9 1714 For I am sure, when he shall see our Army,
9 1715 Hee'le drop his heart into the sinck of feare,
9 1716 And for atchieuement, offer vs his Ransome
9 1717 
9 1718    King. Therefore Lord Constable, hast on Montioy,
9 1719 And let him say to England, that we send,
9 1720 To know what willing Ransome he will giue.
9 1721 Prince Dolphin, you shall stay with vs in Roan
9 1722 
9 1723    Dolph. Not so, I doe beseech your Maiestie
9 1724 
9 1725    King. Be patient, for you shall remaine with vs.
9 1726 Now forth Lord Constable, and Princes all,
9 1727 And quickly bring vs word of Englands fall.
9 1728 
9 1729 Exeunt.
9 1730 
9 1731 Enter Captaines, English and Welch, Gower and Fluellen.
9 1732 
9 1733   Gower. How now Captaine Fluellen, come you from
9 1734 the Bridge?
9 1735   Flu. I assure you, there is very excellent Seruices committed
9 1736 at the Bridge
9 1737 
9 1738    Gower. Is the Duke of Exeter safe?
9 1739   Flu. The Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Agamemnon,
9 1740 and a man that I loue and honour with my soule,
9 1741 and my heart, and my dutie, and my liue, and my liuing,
9 1742 and my vttermost power. He is not, God be praysed and
9 1743 blessed, any hurt in the World, but keepes the Bridge
9 1744 most valiantly, with excellent discipline. There is an aunchient
9 1745 Lieutenant there at the Pridge, I thinke in my very
9 1746 conscience hee is as valiant a man as Marke Anthony, and
9 1747 hee is a man of no estimation in the World, but I did see
9 1748 him doe as gallant seruice
9 1749 
9 1750    Gower. What doe you call him?
9 1751   Flu. Hee is call'd aunchient Pistoll
9 1752 
9 1753    Gower. I know him not.
9 1754 Enter Pistoll.
9 1755 
9 1756   Flu. Here is the man
9 1757 
9 1758    Pist. Captaine, I thee beseech to doe me fauours: the
9 1759 Duke of Exeter doth loue thee well
9 1760 
9 1761    Flu. I, I prayse God, and I haue merited some loue at
9 1762 his hands
9 1763 
9 1764    Pist. Bardolph, a Souldier firme and sound of heart,
9 1765 and of buxome valour, hath by cruell Fate, and giddie
9 1766 Fortunes furious fickle Wheele, that Goddesse blind, that
9 1767 stands vpon the rolling restlesse Stone
9 1768 
9 1769    Flu. By your patience, aunchient Pistoll: Fortune is
9 1770 painted blinde, with a Muffler afore his eyes, to signifie
9 1771 to you, that Fortune is blinde; and shee is painted also
9 1772 with a Wheele, to signifie to you, which is the Morall of
9 1773 it, that shee is turning and inconstant, and mutabilitie,
9 1774 and variation: and her foot, looke you, is fixed vpon a
9 1775 Sphericall Stone, which rowles, and rowles, and rowles:
9 1776 in good truth, the Poet makes a most excellent description
9 1777 of it: Fortune is an excellent Morall
9 1778 
9 1779    Pist. Fortune is Bardolphs foe, and frownes on him:
9 1780 for he hath stolne a Pax, and hanged must a be: a damned
9 1781 death: let Gallowes gape for Dogge, let Man goe free,
9 1782 and let not Hempe his Wind-pipe suffocate: but Exeter
9 1783 hath giuen the doome of death, for Pax of little price.
9 1784 Therefore goe speake, the Duke will heare thy voyce;
9 1785 and let not Bardolphs vitall thred bee cut with edge of
9 1786 Penny-Cord, and vile reproach. Speake Captaine for
9 1787 his Life, and I will thee requite
9 1788 
9 1789    Flu. Aunchient Pistoll, I doe partly vnderstand your
9 1790 meaning
9 1791 
9 1792    Pist. Why then reioyce therefore
9 1793 
9 1794    Flu. Certainly Aunchient, it is not a thing to reioyce
9 1795 at: for if, looke you, he were my Brother, I would desire
9 1796 the Duke to vse his good pleasure, and put him to execution;
9 1797 for discipline ought to be vsed
9 1798 
9 1799    Pist. Dye, and be dam'd, and Figo for thy friendship
9 1800 
9 1801    Flu. It is well
9 1802 
9 1803    Pist. The Figge of Spaine.
9 1804 Enter.
9 1805 
9 1806   Flu. Very good
9 1807 
9 1808    Gower. Why, this is an arrant counterfeit Rascall, I
9 1809 remember him now: a Bawd, a Cut-purse
9 1810 
9 1811    Flu. Ile assure you, a vtt'red as praue words at the
9 1812 Pridge, as you shall see in a Summers day: but it is very
9 1813 well: what he ha's spoke to me, that is well I warrant you,
9 1814 when time is serue
9 1815 
9 1816    Gower. Why 'tis a Gull, a Foole, a Rogue, that now and
9 1817 then goes to the Warres, to grace himselfe at his returne
9 1818 into London, vnder the forme of a Souldier: and such
9 1819 fellowes are perfit in the Great Commanders Names, and
9 1820 they will learne you by rote where Seruices were done;
9 1821 at such and such a Sconce, at such a Breach, at such a Conuoy:
9 1822 who came off brauely, who was shot, who disgrac'd,
9 1823 what termes the Enemy stood on: and this they
9 1824 conne perfitly in the phrase of Warre; which they tricke
9 1825 vp with new-tuned Oathes: and what a Beard of the Generalls
9 1826 Cut, and a horride Sute of the Campe, will doe among
9 1827 foming Bottles, and Ale-washt Wits, is wonderfull
9 1828 to be thought on: but you must learne to know such
9 1829 slanders of the age, or else you may be maruellously mistooke
9 1830 
9 1831    Flu. I tell you what, Captaine Gower: I doe perceiue
9 1832 hee is not the man that hee would gladly make shew to
9 1833 the World hee is: if I finde a hole in his Coat, I will tell
9 1834 him my minde: hearke you, the King is comming, and I
9 1835 must speake with him from the Pridge.
9 1836 
9 1837 Drum and Colours. Enter the King and his poore Souldiers.
9 1838 
9 1839   Flu. God plesse your Maiestie
9 1840 
9 1841    King. How now Fluellen, cam'st thou from the Bridge?
9 1842   Flu. I, so please your Maiestie: The Duke of Exeter
9 1843 ha's very gallantly maintain'd the Pridge; the French is
9 1844 gone off, looke you, and there is gallant and most praue
9 1845 passages: marry, th' athuersarie was haue possession of
9 1846 the Pridge, but he is enforced to retyre, and the Duke of
9 1847 Exeter is Master of the Pridge: I can tell your Maiestie,
9 1848 the Duke is a praue man
9 1849 
9 1850    King. What men haue you lost, Fluellen?
9 1851   Flu. The perdition of th' athuersarie hath beene very
9 1852 great, reasonnable great: marry for my part, I thinke the
9 1853 Duke hath lost neuer a man, but one that is like to be executed
9 1854 for robbing a Church, one Bardolph, if your Maiestie
9 1855 know the man: his face is all bubukles and whelkes,
9 1856 and knobs, and flames a fire, and his lippes blowes at his
9 1857 nose, and it is like a coale of fire, sometimes plew, and
9 1858 sometimes red, but his nose is executed, and his fire's
9 1859 out
9 1860 
9 1861    King. Wee would haue all such offendors so cut off:
9 1862 and we giue expresse charge, that in our Marches through
9 1863 the Countrey, there be nothing compell'd from the Villages;
9 1864 nothing taken, but pay'd for: none of the French
9 1865 vpbrayded or abused in disdainefull Language; for when
9 1866 Leuitie and Crueltie play for a Kingdome, the gentler
9 1867 Gamester is the soonest winner.
9 1868 
9 1869 Tucket. Enter Mountioy.
9 1870 
9 1871   Mountioy. You know me by my habit
9 1872 
9 1873    King. Well then, I know thee: what shall I know of
9 1874 thee?
9 1875   Mountioy. My Masters mind
9 1876 
9 1877    King. Vnfold it
9 1878 
9 1879    Mountioy. Thus sayes my King: Say thou to Harry
9 1880 of England, Though we seem'd dead, we did but sleepe:
9 1881 Aduantage is a better Souldier then rashnesse. Tell him,
9 1882 wee could haue rebuk'd him at Harflewe, but that wee
9 1883 thought not good to bruise an iniurie, till it were full
9 1884 ripe. Now wee speake vpon our Q. and our voyce is imperiall:
9 1885 England shall repent his folly, see his weakenesse,
9 1886 and admire our sufferance. Bid him therefore consider
9 1887 of his ransome, which must proportion the losses we
9 1888 haue borne, the subiects we haue lost, the disgrace we
9 1889 haue digested; which in weight to re-answer, his pettinesse
9 1890 would bow vnder. For our losses, his Exchequer is
9 1891 too poore; for th' effusion of our bloud, the Muster of his
9 1892 Kingdome too faint a number; and for our disgrace, his
9 1893 owne person kneeling at our feet, but a weake and worthlesse
9 1894 satisfaction. To this adde defiance: and tell him for
9 1895 conclusion, he hath betrayed his followers, whose condemnation
9 1896 is pronounc't: So farre my King and Master;
9 1897 so much my Office
9 1898 
9 1899    King. What is thy name? I know thy qualitie
9 1900 
9 1901    Mount. Mountioy
9 1902 
9 1903    King. Thou doo'st thy Office fairely. Turne thee backe,
9 1904 And tell thy King, I doe not seeke him now,
9 1905 But could be willing to march on to Callice,
9 1906 Without impeachment: for to say the sooth,
9 1907 Though 'tis no wisdome to confesse so much
9 1908 Vnto an enemie of Craft and Vantage,
9 1909 My people are with sicknesse much enfeebled,
9 1910 My numbers lessen'd: and those few I haue,
9 1911 Almost no better then so many French;
9 1912 Who when they were in health, I tell thee Herald,
9 1913 I thought, vpon one payre of English Legges
9 1914 Did march three Frenchmen. Yet forgiue me God,
9 1915 That I doe bragge thus; this your ayre of France
9 1916 Hath blowne that vice in me. I must repent:
9 1917 Goe therefore tell thy Master, heere I am;
9 1918 My Ransome, is this frayle and worthlesse Trunke;
9 1919 My Army, but a weake and sickly Guard:
9 1920 Yet God before, tell him we will come on,
9 1921 Though France himselfe, and such another Neighbor
9 1922 Stand in our way. There's for thy labour Mountioy.
9 1923 Goe bid thy Master well aduise himselfe.
9 1924 If we may passe, we will: if we be hindred,
9 1925 We shall your tawnie ground with your red blood
9 1926 Discolour: and so Mountioy, fare you well.
9 1927 The summe of all our Answer is but this:
9 1928 We would not seeke a Battaile as we are,
9 1929 Nor as we are, we say we will not shun it:
9 1930 So tell your Master
9 1931 
9 1932    Mount. I shall deliuer so: Thankes to your Highnesse
9 1933 
9 1934    Glouc. I hope they will not come vpon vs now
9 1935 
9 1936    King. We are in Gods hand, Brother, not in theirs:
9 1937 March to the Bridge, it now drawes toward night,
9 1938 Beyond the Riuer wee'le encampe our selues,
9 1939 And on to morrow bid them march away.
9 1940 
9 1941 Exeunt.
9 1942 
9 1943 Enter the Constable of France, the Lord Ramburs, Orleance,
9 1944 Dolphin, with
9 1945 others.
9 1946 
9 1947   Const. Tut, I haue the best Armour of the World:
9 1948 would it were day
9 1949 
9 1950    Orleance. You haue an excellent Armour: but let my
9 1951 Horse haue his due
9 1952 
9 1953    Const. It is the best Horse of Europe
9 1954 
9 1955    Orleance. Will it neuer be Morning?
9 1956   Dolph. My Lord of Orleance, and my Lord High Constable,
9 1957 you talke of Horse and Armour?
9 1958   Orleance. You are as well prouided of both, as any
9 1959 Prince in the World
9 1960 
9 1961    Dolph. What a long Night is this? I will not change
9 1962 my Horse with any that treades but on foure postures:
9 1963 ch' ha: he bounds from the Earth, as if his entrayles were
9 1964 hayres: le Cheual volante, the Pegasus, ches les narines de
9 1965 feu. When I bestryde him, I soare, I am a Hawke: he trots
9 1966 the ayre: the Earth sings, when he touches it: the basest
9 1967 horne of his hoofe, is more Musicall then the Pipe of
9 1968 Hermes
9 1969 
9 1970    Orleance. Hee's of the colour of the Nutmeg
9 1971 
9 1972    Dolph. And of the heat of the Ginger. It is a Beast
9 1973 for Perseus: hee is pure Ayre and Fire; and the dull Elements
9 1974 of Earth and Water neuer appeare in him, but only
9 1975 in patient stillnesse while his Rider mounts him: hee
9 1976 is indeede a Horse, and all other Iades you may call
9 1977 Beasts
9 1978 
9 1979    Const. Indeed my Lord, it is a most absolute and excellent
9 1980 Horse
9 1981 
9 1982    Dolph. It is the Prince of Palfrayes, his Neigh is like
9 1983 the bidding of a Monarch, and his countenance enforces
9 1984 Homage
9 1985 
9 1986    Orleance. No more Cousin
9 1987 
9 1988    Dolph. Nay, the man hath no wit, that cannot from
9 1989 the rising of the Larke to the lodging of the Lambe,
9 1990 varie deserued prayse on my Palfray: it is a Theame as
9 1991 fluent as the Sea: Turne the Sands into eloquent tongues,
9 1992 and my Horse is argument for them all: 'tis a subiect
9 1993 for a Soueraigne to reason on, and for a Soueraignes Soueraigne
9 1994 to ride on: And for the World, familiar to vs,
9 1995 and vnknowne, to lay apart their particular Functions,
9 1996 and wonder at him, I once writ a Sonnet in his prayse,
9 1997 and began thus, Wonder of Nature
9 1998 
9 1999    Orleance. I haue heard a Sonnet begin so to ones Mistresse
9 2000 
9 2001    Dolph. Then did they imitate that which I compos'd
9 2002 to my Courser, for my Horse is my Mistresse
9 2003 
9 2004    Orleance. Your Mistresse beares well
9 2005 
9 2006    Dolph. Me well, which is the prescript prayse and perfection
9 2007 of a good and particular Mistresse
9 2008 
9 2009    Const. Nay, for me thought yesterday your Mistresse
9 2010 shrewdly shooke your back
9 2011 
9 2012    Dolph. So perhaps did yours
9 2013 
9 2014    Const. Mine was not bridled
9 2015 
9 2016    Dolph. O then belike she was old and gentle, and you
9 2017 rode like a Kerne of Ireland, your French Hose off, and in
9 2018 your strait Strossers
9 2019 
9 2020    Const. You haue good iudgement in Horsemanship
9 2021 
9 2022    Dolph. Be warn'd by me then: they that ride so, and
9 2023 ride not warily, fall into foule Boggs: I had rather haue
9 2024 my Horse to my Mistresse
9 2025 
9 2026    Const. I had as liue haue my Mistresse a Iade
9 2027 
9 2028    Dolph. I tell thee Constable, my Mistresse weares his
9 2029 owne hayre
9 2030 
9 2031    Const. I could make as true a boast as that, if I had a
9 2032 Sow to my Mistresse
9 2033 
9 2034    Dolph. Le chien est retourne a son propre vemissement est
9 2035 la leuye lauee au bourbier: thou mak'st vse of any thing
9 2036 
9 2037    Const. Yet doe I not vse my Horse for my Mistresse,
9 2038 or any such Prouerbe, so little kin to the purpose
9 2039 
9 2040    Ramb. My Lord Constable, the Armour that I saw in
9 2041 your Tent to night, are those Starres or Sunnes vpon it?
9 2042   Const. Starres my Lord
9 2043 
9 2044    Dolph. Some of them will fall to morrow, I hope
9 2045 
9 2046    Const. And yet my Sky shall not want
9 2047 
9 2048    Dolph. That may be, for you beare a many superfluously,
9 2049 and 'twere more honor some were away
9 2050 
9 2051    Const. Eu'n as your Horse beares your prayses, who
9 2052 would trot as well, were some of your bragges dismounted
9 2053 
9 2054    Dolph. Would I were able to loade him with his desert.
9 2055 Will it neuer be day? I will trot to morrow a mile,
9 2056 and my way shall be paued with English Faces
9 2057 
9 2058    Const. I will not say so, for feare I should be fac't out
9 2059 of my way: but I would it were morning, for I would
9 2060 faine be about the eares of the English
9 2061 
9 2062    Ramb. Who will goe to Hazard with me for twentie
9 2063 Prisoners?
9 2064   Const. You must first goe your selfe to hazard, ere you
9 2065 haue them
9 2066 
9 2067    Dolph. 'Tis Mid-night, Ile goe arme my selfe.
9 2068 Enter.
9 2069 
9 2070   Orleance. The Dolphin longs for morning
9 2071 
9 2072    Ramb. He longs to eate the English
9 2073 
9 2074    Const. I thinke he will eate all he kills
9 2075 
9 2076    Orleance. By the white Hand of my Lady, hee's a gallant
9 2077 Prince
9 2078 
9 2079    Const. Sweare by her Foot, that she may tread out the
9 2080 Oath
9 2081 
9 2082    Orleance. He is simply the most actiue Gentleman of
9 2083 France
9 2084 
9 2085    Const. Doing is actiuitie, and he will still be doing
9 2086 
9 2087    Orleance. He neuer did harme, that I heard of
9 2088 
9 2089    Const. Nor will doe none to morrow: hee will keepe
9 2090 that good name still
9 2091 
9 2092    Orleance. I know him to be valiant
9 2093 
9 2094    Const. I was told that, by one that knowes him better
9 2095 then you
9 2096 
9 2097    Orleance. What's hee?
9 2098   Const. Marry hee told me so himselfe, and hee sayd hee
9 2099 car'd not who knew it
9 2100 
9 2101    Orleance. Hee needes not, it is no hidden vertue in
9 2102 him
9 2103 
9 2104    Const. By my faith Sir, but it is: neuer any body saw
9 2105 it, but his Lacquey: 'tis a hooded valour, and when it
9 2106 appeares, it will bate
9 2107 
9 2108    Orleance. Ill will neuer sayd well
9 2109 
9 2110    Const. I will cap that Prouerbe with, There is flatterie
9 2111 in friendship
9 2112 
9 2113    Orleance. And I will take vp that with, Giue the Deuill
9 2114 his due
9 2115 
9 2116    Const. Well plac't: there stands your friend for the
9 2117 Deuill: haue at the very eye of that Prouerbe with, A
9 2118 Pox of the Deuill
9 2119 
9 2120    Orleance. You are the better at Prouerbs, by how much
9 2121 a Fooles Bolt is soone shot
9 2122 
9 2123    Const. You haue shot ouer
9 2124 
9 2125    Orleance. 'Tis not the first time you were ouer-shot.
9 2126 Enter a Messenger.
9 2127 
9 2128   Mess. My Lord high Constable, the English lye within
9 2129 fifteene hundred paces of your Tents
9 2130 
9 2131    Const. Who hath measur'd the ground?
9 2132   Mess. The Lord Grandpree
9 2133 
9 2134    Const. A valiant and most expert Gentleman. Would
9 2135 it were day? Alas poore Harry of England: hee longs
9 2136 not for the Dawning, as wee doe
9 2137 
9 2138    Orleance. What a wretched and peeuish fellow is this
9 2139 King of England, to mope with his fat-brain'd followers
9 2140 so farre out of his knowledge
9 2141 
9 2142    Const. If the English had any apprehension, they
9 2143 would runne away
9 2144 
9 2145    Orleance. That they lack: for if their heads had any intellectuall
9 2146 Armour, they could neuer weare such heauie
9 2147 Head-pieces
9 2148 
9 2149    Ramb. That Iland of England breedes very valiant
9 2150 Creatures; their Mastiffes are of vnmatchable courage
9 2151 
9 2152    Orleance. Foolish Curres, that runne winking into
9 2153 the mouth of a Russian Beare, and haue their heads crusht
9 2154 like rotten Apples: you may as well say, that's a valiant
9 2155 Flea, that dare eate his breakefast on the Lippe of a
9 2156 Lyon
9 2157 
9 2158    Const. Iust, iust: and the men doe sympathize with
9 2159 the Mastiffes, in robustious and rough comming on,
9 2160 leauing their Wits with their Wiues: and then giue
9 2161 them great Meales of Beefe, and Iron and Steele; they
9 2162 will eate like Wolues, and fight like Deuils
9 2163 
9 2164    Orleance. I, but these English are shrowdly out of
9 2165 Beefe
9 2166 
9 2167    Const. Then shall we finde to morrow, they haue only
9 2168 stomackes to eate, and none to fight. Now is it time to
9 2169 arme: come, shall we about it?
9 2170   Orleance. It is now two a Clock: but let me see, by ten
9 2171 Wee shall haue each a hundred English men.
9 2172 
9 2173 Exeunt.
9 2174 
9 2175 
9 2176 Actus Tertius.
9 2177 
9 2178 Chorus.
9 2179 
9 2180 Now entertaine coniecture of a time,
9 2181 When creeping Murmure and the poring Darke
9 2182 Fills the wide Vessell of the Vniuerse.
9 2183 From Camp to Camp, through the foule Womb of Night
9 2184 The Humme of eyther Army stilly sounds;
9 2185 That the fixt Centinels almost receiue
9 2186 The secret Whispers of each others Watch.
9 2187 Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames
9 2188 Each Battaile sees the others vmber'd face.
9 2189 Steed threatens Steed, in high and boastfull Neighs
9 2190 Piercing the Nights dull Eare: and from the Tents,
9 2191 The Armourers accomplishing the Knights,
9 2192 With busie Hammers closing Riuets vp,
9 2193 Giue dreadfull note of preparation.
9 2194 The Countrey Cocks doe crow, the Clocks doe towle:
9 2195 And the third howre of drowsie Morning nam'd,
9 2196 Prowd of their Numbers, and secure in Soule,
9 2197 The confident and ouer-lustie French,
9 2198 Doe the low-rated English play at Dice;
9 2199 And chide the creeple-tardy-gated Night,
9 2200 Who like a foule and ougly Witch doth limpe
9 2201 So tediously away. The poore condemned English,
9 2202 Like Sacrifices, by their watchfull Fires
9 2203 Sit patiently, and inly ruminate
9 2204 The Mornings danger: and their gesture sad,
9 2205 Inuesting lanke-leane Cheekes, and Warre-worne Coats,
9 2206 Presented them vnto the gazing Moone
9 2207 So many horride Ghosts. O now, who will behold
9 2208 The Royall Captaine of this ruin'd Band
9 2209 Walking from Watch to Watch, from Tent to Tent;
9 2210 Let him cry, Prayse and Glory on his head:
9 2211 For forth he goes, and visits all his Hoast,
9 2212 Bids them good morrow with a modest Smyle,
9 2213 And calls them Brothers, Friends, and Countreymen.
9 2214 Vpon his Royall Face there is no note,
9 2215 How dread an Army hath enrounded him;
9 2216 Nor doth he dedicate one iot of Colour
9 2217 Vnto the wearie and all-watched Night:
9 2218 But freshly lookes, and ouer-beares Attaint,
9 2219 With chearefull semblance, and sweet Maiestie:
9 2220 That euery Wretch, pining and pale before,
9 2221 Beholding him, plucks comfort from his Lookes.
9 2222 A Largesse vniuersall, like the Sunne,
9 2223 His liberall Eye doth giue to euery one,
9 2224 Thawing cold feare, that meane and gentle all
9 2225 Behold, as may vnworthinesse define.
9 2226 A little touch of Harry in the Night,
9 2227 And so our Scene must to the Battaile flye:
9 2228 Where, O for pitty, we shall much disgrace,
9 2229 With foure or fiue most vile and ragged foyles,
9 2230 (Right ill dispos'd, in brawle ridiculous)
9 2231 The Name of Agincourt: Yet sit and see,
9 2232 Minding true things, by what their Mock'ries bee.
9 2233 Enter.
9 2234 
9 2235 Enter the King, Bedford, and Gloucester.
9 2236 
9 2237   King. Gloster, 'tis true that we are in great danger,
9 2238 The greater therefore should our Courage be.
9 2239 God morrow Brother Bedford: God Almightie,
9 2240 There is some soule of goodnesse in things euill,
9 2241 Would men obseruingly distill it out.
9 2242 For our bad Neighbour makes vs early stirrers,
9 2243 Which is both healthfull, and good husbandry.
9 2244 Besides, they are our outward Consciences,
9 2245 And Preachers to vs all; admonishing,
9 2246 That we should dresse vs fairely for our end.
9 2247 Thus may we gather Honey from the Weed,
9 2248 And make a Morall of the Diuell himselfe.
9 2249 Enter Erpingham.
9 2250 
9 2251 Good morrow old Sir Thomas Erpingham:
9 2252 A good soft Pillow for that good white Head,
9 2253 Were better then a churlish turfe of France
9 2254 
9 2255    Erping. Not so my Liege, this Lodging likes me better,
9 2256 Since I may say, now lye I like a King
9 2257 
9 2258    King. 'Tis good for men to loue their present paines,
9 2259 Vpon example, so the Spirit is eased:
9 2260 And when the Mind is quickned, out of doubt
9 2261 The Organs, though defunct and dead before,
9 2262 Breake vp their drowsie Graue, and newly moue
9 2263 With casted slough, and fresh legeritie.
9 2264 Lend me thy Cloake Sir Thomas: Brothers both,
9 2265 Commend me to the Princes in our Campe;
9 2266 Doe my good morrow to them, and anon
9 2267 Desire them all to my Pauillion
9 2268 
9 2269    Gloster. We shall, my Liege
9 2270 
9 2271    Erping. Shall I attend your Grace?
9 2272   King. No, my good Knight:
9 2273 Goe with my Brothers to my Lords of England:
9 2274 I and my Bosome must debate a while,
9 2275 And then I would no other company
9 2276 
9 2277    Erping. The Lord in Heauen blesse thee, Noble
9 2278 Harry.
9 2279 
9 2280 Exeunt.
9 2281 
9 2282   King. God a mercy old Heart, thou speak'st chearefully.
9 2283 Enter Pistoll
9 2284 
9 2285    Pist. Che vous la?
9 2286   King. A friend
9 2287 
9 2288    Pist. Discusse vnto me, art thou Officer, or art thou
9 2289 base, common, and popular?
9 2290   King. I am a Gentleman of a Company
9 2291 
9 2292    Pist. Trayl'st thou the puissant Pyke?
9 2293   King. Euen so: what are you?
9 2294   Pist. As good a Gentleman as the Emperor
9 2295 
9 2296    King. Then you are a better then the King
9 2297 
9 2298    Pist. The King's a Bawcock, and a Heart of Gold, a
9 2299 Lad of Life, an Impe of Fame, of Parents good, of Fist
9 2300 most valiant: I kisse his durtie shooe, and from heartstring
9 2301 I loue the louely Bully. What is thy Name?
9 2302   King. Harry le Roy
9 2303 
9 2304    Pist. Le Roy? a Cornish Name: art thou of Cornish Crew?
9 2305   King. No, I am a Welchman
9 2306 
9 2307    Pist. Know'st thou Fluellen?
9 2308   King. Yes
9 2309 
9 2310    Pist. Tell him Ile knock his Leeke about his Pate vpon
9 2311 S[aint]. Dauies day
9 2312 
9 2313    King. Doe not you weare your Dagger in your Cappe
9 2314 that day, least he knock that about yours
9 2315 
9 2316    Pist. Art thou his friend?
9 2317   King. And his Kinsman too
9 2318 
9 2319    Pist. The Figo for thee then
9 2320 
9 2321    King. I thanke you: God be with you
9 2322 
9 2323    Pist. My name is Pistol call'd.
9 2324 Enter.
9 2325 
9 2326   King. It sorts well with your fiercenesse.
9 2327 
9 2328 Manet King.
9 2329 
9 2330 Enter Fluellen and Gower.
9 2331 
9 2332   Gower. Captaine Fluellen
9 2333 
9 2334    Flu. 'So, in the Name of Iesu Christ, speake fewer: it
9 2335 is the greatest admiration in the vniuersall World, when
9 2336 the true and aunchient Prerogatifes and Lawes of the
9 2337 Warres is not kept: if you would take the paines but to
9 2338 examine the Warres of Pompey the Great, you shall finde,
9 2339 I warrant you, that there is no tiddle tadle nor pibble bable
9 2340 in Pompeyes Campe: I warrant you, you shall finde
9 2341 the Ceremonies of the Warres, and the Cares of it, and
9 2342 the Formes of it, and the Sobrietie of it, and the Modestie
9 2343 of it, to be otherwise
9 2344 
9 2345    Gower. Why the Enemie is lowd, you heare him all
9 2346 Night
9 2347 
9 2348    Flu. If the Enemie is an Asse and a Foole, and a prating
9 2349 Coxcombe; is it meet, thinke you, that wee should
9 2350 also, looke you, be an Asse and a Foole, and a prating Coxcombe,
9 2351 in your owne conscience now?
9 2352   Gow. I will speake lower
9 2353 
9 2354    Flu. I pray you, and beseech you, that you will.
9 2355 Enter.
9 2356 
9 2357   King. Though it appeare a little out of fashion,
9 2358 There is much care and valour in this Welchman.
9 2359 Enter three Souldiers, Iohn Bates, Alexander Court, and Michael
9 2360 Williams.
9 2361 
9 2362 
9 2363   Court. Brother Iohn Bates, is not that the Morning
9 2364 which breakes yonder?
9 2365   Bates. I thinke it be: but wee haue no great cause to
9 2366 desire the approach of day
9 2367 
9 2368    Williams. Wee see yonder the beginning of the day,
9 2369 but I thinke wee shall neuer see the end of it. Who goes
9 2370 there?
9 2371   King. A Friend
9 2372 
9 2373    Williams. Vnder what Captaine serue you?
9 2374   King. Vnder Sir Iohn Erpingham
9 2375 
9 2376    Williams. A good old Commander, and a most kinde
9 2377 Gentleman: I pray you, what thinkes he of our estate?
9 2378   King. Euen as men wrackt vpon a Sand, that looke to
9 2379 be washt off the next Tyde
9 2380 
9 2381    Bates. He hath not told his thought to the King?
9 2382   King. No: nor it is not meet he should: for though I
9 2383 speake it to you, I thinke the King is but a man, as I am:
9 2384 the Violet smells to him, as it doth to me; the Element
9 2385 shewes to him, as it doth to me; all his Sences haue but
9 2386 humane Conditions: his Ceremonies layd by, in his Nakednesse
9 2387 he appeares but a man; and though his affections
9 2388 are higher mounted then ours, yet when they stoupe,
9 2389 they stoupe with the like wing: therefore, when he sees
9 2390 reason of feares, as we doe; his feares, out of doubt, be of
9 2391 the same rellish as ours are: yet in reason, no man should
9 2392 possesse him with any appearance of feare; least hee, by
9 2393 shewing it, should dis-hearten his Army
9 2394 
9 2395    Bates. He may shew what outward courage he will:
9 2396 but I beleeue, as cold a Night as 'tis, hee could wish himselfe
9 2397 in Thames vp to the Neck; and so I would he were,
9 2398 and I by him, at all aduentures, so we were quit here
9 2399 
9 2400    King. By my troth, I will speake my conscience of the
9 2401 King: I thinke hee would not wish himselfe any where,
9 2402 but where hee is
9 2403 
9 2404    Bates. Then I would he were here alone; so should he be
9 2405 sure to be ransomed, and a many poore mens liues saued
9 2406 
9 2407    King. I dare say, you loue him not so ill, to wish him
9 2408 here alone: howsoeuer you speake this to feele other
9 2409 mens minds, me thinks I could not dye any where so contented,
9 2410 as in the Kings company; his Cause being iust, and
9 2411 his Quarrell honorable
9 2412 
9 2413    Williams. That's more then we know
9 2414 
9 2415    Bates. I, or more then wee should seeke after; for wee
9 2416 know enough, if wee know wee are the Kings Subiects:
9 2417 if his Cause be wrong, our obedience to the King wipes
9 2418 the Cryme of it out of vs
9 2419 
9 2420    Williams. But if the Cause be not good, the King himselfe
9 2421 hath a heauie Reckoning to make, when all those
9 2422 Legges, and Armes, and Heads, chopt off in a Battaile,
9 2423 shall ioyne together at the latter day, and cry all, Wee dyed
9 2424 at such a place, some swearing, some crying for a Surgean;
9 2425 some vpon their Wiues, left poore behind them;
9 2426 some vpon the Debts they owe, some vpon their Children
9 2427 rawly left: I am afear'd, there are few dye well, that dye
9 2428 in a Battaile: for how can they charitably dispose of any
9 2429 thing, when Blood is their argument? Now, if these men
9 2430 doe not dye well, it will be a black matter for the King,
9 2431 that led them to it; who to disobey, were against all proportion
9 2432 of subiection
9 2433 
9 2434    King. So, if a Sonne that is by his Father sent about
9 2435 Merchandize, doe sinfully miscarry vpon the Sea; the imputation
9 2436 of his wickednesse, by your rule, should be imposed
9 2437 vpon his Father that sent him: or if a Seruant, vnder
9 2438 his Masters command, transporting a summe of Money,
9 2439 be assayled by Robbers, and dye in many irreconcil'd
9 2440 Iniquities; you may call the businesse of the Master the
9 2441 author of the Seruants damnation: but this is not so:
9 2442 The King is not bound to answer the particular endings
9 2443 of his Souldiers, the Father of his Sonne, nor the Master
9 2444 of his Seruant; for they purpose not their death, when
9 2445 they purpose their seruices. Besides, there is no King, be
9 2446 his Cause neuer so spotlesse, if it come to the arbitrement
9 2447 of Swords, can trye it out with all vnspotted Souldiers:
9 2448 some (peraduenture) haue on them the guilt of
9 2449 premeditated and contriued Murther; some, of beguiling
9 2450 Virgins with the broken Seales of Periurie; some,
9 2451 making the Warres their Bulwarke, that haue before gored
9 2452 the gentle Bosome of Peace with Pillage and Robberie.
9 2453 Now, if these men haue defeated the Law, and outrunne
9 2454 Natiue punishment; though they can out-strip
9 2455 men, they haue no wings to flye from God. Warre is
9 2456 his Beadle, Warre is his Vengeance: so that here men
9 2457 are punisht, for before breach of the Kings Lawes, in
9 2458 now the Kings Quarrell: where they feared the death,
9 2459 they haue borne life away; and where they would bee
9 2460 safe, they perish. Then if they dye vnprouided, no more
9 2461 is the King guiltie of their damnation, then hee was before
9 2462 guiltie of those Impieties, for the which they are
9 2463 now visited. Euery Subiects Dutie is the Kings, but
9 2464 euery Subiects Soule is his owne. Therefore should
9 2465 euery Souldier in the Warres doe as euery sicke man in
9 2466 his Bed, wash euery Moth out of his Conscience: and
9 2467 dying so, Death is to him aduantage; or not dying,
9 2468 the time was blessedly lost, wherein such preparation was
9 2469 gayned: and in him that escapes, it were not sinne to
9 2470 thinke, that making God so free an offer, he let him outliue
9 2471 that day, to see his Greatnesse, and to teach others
9 2472 how they should prepare
9 2473 
9 2474    Will. 'Tis certaine, euery man that dyes ill, the ill vpon
9 2475 his owne head, the King is not to answer it
9 2476 
9 2477    Bates. I doe not desire hee should answer for me, and
9 2478 yet I determine to fight lustily for him
9 2479 
9 2480    King. I my selfe heard the King say he would not be
9 2481 ransom'd
9 2482 
9 2483    Will. I, hee said so, to make vs fight chearefully: but
9 2484 when our throats are cut, hee may be ransom'd, and wee
9 2485 ne're the wiser
9 2486 
9 2487    King. If I liue to see it, I will neuer trust his word after
9 2488 
9 2489    Will. You pay him then: that's a perillous shot out
9 2490 of an Elder Gunne, that a poore and a priuate displeasure
9 2491 can doe against a Monarch: you may as well goe about
9 2492 to turne the Sunne to yce, with fanning in his face with a
9 2493 Peacocks feather: You'le neuer trust his word after;
9 2494 come, 'tis a foolish saying
9 2495 
9 2496    King. Your reproofe is something too round, I should
9 2497 be angry with you, if the time were conuenient
9 2498 
9 2499    Will. Let it bee a Quarrell betweene vs, if you
9 2500 liue
9 2501 
9 2502    King. I embrace it
9 2503 
9 2504    Will. How shall I know thee againe?
9 2505   King. Giue me any Gage of thine, and I will weare it
9 2506 in my Bonnet: Then if euer thou dar'st acknowledge it,
9 2507 I will make it my Quarrell
9 2508 
9 2509    Will. Heere's my Gloue: Giue mee another of
9 2510 thine
9 2511 
9 2512    King. There
9 2513 
9 2514    Will. This will I also weare in my Cap: if euer thou
9 2515 come to me, and say, after to morrow, This is my Gloue,
9 2516 by this Hand I will take thee a box on the eare
9 2517 
9 2518    King. If euer I liue to see it, I will challenge it
9 2519 
9 2520    Will. Thou dar'st as well be hang'd
9 2521 
9 2522    King. Well, I will doe it, though I take thee in the
9 2523 Kings companie
9 2524 
9 2525    Will. Keepe thy word: fare thee well
9 2526 
9 2527    Bates. Be friends you English fooles, be friends, wee
9 2528 haue French Quarrels enow, if you could tell how to reckon.
9 2529 
9 2530 Exit Souldiers.
9 2531 
9 2532   King. Indeede the French may lay twentie French
9 2533 Crownes to one, they will beat vs, for they beare them
9 2534 on their shoulders: but it is no English Treason to cut
9 2535 French Crownes, and to morrow the King himselfe will
9 2536 be a Clipper.
9 2537 Vpon the King, let vs our Liues, our Soules,
9 2538 Our Debts, our carefull Wiues,
9 2539 Our Children, and our Sinnes, lay on the King:
9 2540 We must beare all.
9 2541 O hard Condition, Twin-borne with Greatnesse,
9 2542 Subiect to the breath of euery foole, whose sence
9 2543 No more can feele, but his owne wringing.
9 2544 What infinite hearts-ease must Kings neglect,
9 2545 That priuate men enioy?
9 2546 And what haue Kings, that Priuates haue not too,
9 2547 Saue Ceremonie, saue generall Ceremonie?
9 2548 And what art thou, thou Idoll Ceremonie?
9 2549 What kind of God art thou? that suffer'st more
9 2550 Of mortall griefes, then doe thy worshippers.
9 2551 What are thy Rents? what are thy Commings in?
9 2552 O Ceremonie, shew me but thy worth.
9 2553 What? is thy Soule of Odoration?
9 2554 Art thou ought else but Place, Degree, and Forme,
9 2555 Creating awe and feare in other men?
9 2556 Wherein thou art lesse happy, being fear'd,
9 2557 Then they in fearing.
9 2558 What drink'st thou oft, in stead of Homage sweet,
9 2559 But poyson'd flatterie? O, be sick, great Greatnesse,
9 2560 And bid thy Ceremonie giue thee cure.
9 2561 Thinks thou the fierie Feuer will goe out
9 2562 With Titles blowne from Adulation?
9 2563 Will it giue place to flexure and low bending?
9 2564 Canst thou, when thou command'st the beggers knee,
9 2565 Command the health of it? No, thou prowd Dreame,
9 2566 That play'st so subtilly with a Kings Repose.
9 2567 I am a King that find thee: and I know,
9 2568 'Tis not the Balme, the Scepter, and the Ball,
9 2569 The Sword, the Mase, the Crowne Imperiall,
9 2570 The enter-tissued Robe of Gold and Pearle,
9 2571 The farsed Title running 'fore the King,
9 2572 The Throne he sits on: nor the Tyde of Pompe,
9 2573 That beates vpon the high shore of this World:
9 2574 No, not all these, thrice-gorgeous Ceremonie;
9 2575 Not all these, lay'd in Bed Maiesticall,
9 2576 Can sleepe so soundly, as the wretched Slaue:
9 2577 Who with a body fill'd, and vacant mind,
9 2578 Gets him to rest, cram'd with distressefull bread,
9 2579 Neuer sees horride Night, the Child of Hell:
9 2580 But like a Lacquey, from the Rise to Set,
9 2581 Sweates in the eye of Phebus; and all Night
9 2582 Sleepes in Elizium: next day after dawne,
9 2583 Doth rise and helpe Hiperio[n] to his Horse,
9 2584 And followes so the euer-running yeere
9 2585 With profitable labour to his Graue:
9 2586 And but for Ceremonie, such a Wretch,
9 2587 Winding vp Dayes with toyle, and Nights with sleepe,
9 2588 Had the fore-hand and vantage of a King.
9 2589 The Slaue, a Member of the Countreyes peace,
9 2590 Enioyes it; but in grosse braine little wots,
9 2591 What watch the King keepes, to maintaine the peace;
9 2592 Whose howres, the Pesant best aduantages.
9 2593 Enter Erpingham.
9 2594 
9 2595   Erp. My Lord, your Nobles iealous of your absence,
9 2596 Seeke through your Campe to find you
9 2597 
9 2598    King. Good old Knight, collect them all together
9 2599 At my Tent: Ile be before thee
9 2600 
9 2601    Erp. I shall doo't, my Lord.
9 2602 Enter.
9 2603 
9 2604   King. O God of Battailes, steele my Souldiers hearts,
9 2605 Possesse them not with feare: Take from them now
9 2606 The sence of reckning of th' opposed numbers:
9 2607 Pluck their hearts from them. Not to day, O Lord,
9 2608 O not to day, thinke not vpon the fault
9 2609 My Father made, in compassing the Crowne.
9 2610 I Richards body haue interred new,
9 2611 And on it haue bestowed more contrite teares,
9 2612 Then from it issued forced drops of blood.
9 2613 Fiue hundred poore I haue in yeerely pay,
9 2614 Who twice a day their wither'd hands hold vp
9 2615 Toward Heauen, to pardon blood:
9 2616 And I haue built two Chauntries,
9 2617 Where the sad and solemne Priests sing still
9 2618 For Richards Soule. More will I doe:
9 2619 Though all that I can doe, is nothing worth;
9 2620 Since that my Penitence comes after all,
9 2621 Imploring pardon.
9 2622 Enter Gloucester.
9 2623 
9 2624   Glouc. My Liege
9 2625 
9 2626    King. My Brother Gloucesters voyce? I:
9 2627 I know thy errand, I will goe with thee:
9 2628 The day, my friend, and all things stay for me.
9 2629 
9 2630 Exeunt.
9 2631 
9 2632 Enter the Dolphin, Orleance, Ramburs, and Beaumont.
9 2633 
9 2634   Orleance. The Sunne doth gild our Armour vp, my
9 2635 Lords
9 2636 
9 2637    Dolph. Monte Cheual: My Horse, Verlot Lacquay:
9 2638 Ha
9 2639 
9 2640    Orleance. Oh braue Spirit
9 2641 
9 2642    Dolph. Via les ewes & terre
9 2643 
9 2644    Orleance. Rien puis le air & feu
9 2645 
9 2646    Dolph. Cein, Cousin Orleance.
9 2647 Enter Constable.
9 2648 
9 2649 Now my Lord Constable?
9 2650   Const. Hearke how our Steedes, for present Seruice
9 2651 neigh
9 2652 
9 2653    Dolph. Mount them, and make incision in their Hides,
9 2654 That their hot blood may spin in English eyes,
9 2655 And doubt them with superfluous courage: ha
9 2656 
9 2657    Ram. What, wil you haue them weep our Horses blood?
9 2658 How shall we then behold their naturall teares?
9 2659 Enter Messenger.
9 2660 
9 2661   Messeng. The English are embattail'd, you French
9 2662 Peeres
9 2663 
9 2664    Const. To Horse you gallant Princes, straight to Horse.
9 2665 Doe but behold yond poore and starued Band,
9 2666 And your faire shew shall suck away their Soules,
9 2667 Leauing them but the shales and huskes of men.
9 2668 There is not worke enough for all our hands,
9 2669 Scarce blood enough in all their sickly Veines,
9 2670 To giue each naked Curtleax a stayne,
9 2671 That our French Gallants shall to day draw out,
9 2672 And sheath for lack of sport. Let vs but blow on them,
9 2673 The vapour of our Valour will o're-turne them.
9 2674 'Tis positiue against all exceptions, Lords,
9 2675 That our superfluous Lacquies, and our Pesants,
9 2676 Who in vnnecessarie action swarme
9 2677 About our Squares of Battaile, were enow
9 2678 To purge this field of such a hilding Foe;
9 2679 Though we vpon this Mountaines Basis by,
9 2680 Tooke stand for idle speculation:
9 2681 But that our Honours must not. What's to say?
9 2682 A very little little let vs doe,
9 2683 And all is done: then let the Trumpets sound
9 2684 The Tucket Sonuance, and the Note to mount:
9 2685 For our approach shall so much dare the field,
9 2686 That England shall couch downe in feare, and yeeld.
9 2687 Enter Graundpree.
9 2688 
9 2689   Grandpree. Why do you stay so long, my Lords of France?
9 2690 Yond Iland Carrions, desperate of their bones,
9 2691 Ill-fauoredly become the Morning field:
9 2692 Their ragged Curtaines poorely are let loose,
9 2693 And our Ayre shakes them passing scornefully.
9 2694 Bigge Mars seemes banqu'rout in their begger'd Hoast,
9 2695 And faintly through a rustie Beuer peepes.
9 2696 The Horsemen sit like fixed Candlesticks,
9 2697 With Torch-staues in their hand: and their poore Iades
9 2698 Lob downe their heads, dropping the hides and hips:
9 2699 The gumme downe roping from their pale-dead eyes,
9 2700 And in their pale dull mouthes the Iymold Bitt
9 2701 Lyes foule with chaw'd-grasse, still and motionlesse.
9 2702 And their executors, the knauish Crowes,
9 2703 Flye o're them all, impatient for their howre.
9 2704 Description cannot sute it selfe in words,
9 2705 To demonstrate the Life of such a Battaile,
9 2706 In life so liuelesse, as it shewes it selfe
9 2707 
9 2708    Const. They haue said their prayers,
9 2709 And they stay for death
9 2710 
9 2711    Dolph. Shall we goe send them Dinners, and fresh Sutes,
9 2712 And giue their fasting Horses Prouender,
9 2713 And after fight with them?
9 2714   Const. I stay but for my Guard: on
9 2715 To the field, I will the Banner from a Trumpet take,
9 2716 And vse it for my haste. Come, come away,
9 2717 The Sunne is high, and we out-weare the day.
9 2718 
9 2719 Exeunt.
9 2720 
9 2721 Enter Gloucester, Bedford, Exeter, Erpingham with all his Hoast:
9 2722 Salisbury, and Westmerland.
9 2723 
9 2724   Glouc. Where is the King?
9 2725   Bedf. The King himselfe is rode to view their Battaile
9 2726 
9 2727    West. Of fighting men they haue full threescore thousand
9 2728 
9 2729    Exe. There's fiue to one, besides they all are fresh
9 2730 
9 2731    Salisb. Gods Arme strike with vs, 'tis a fearefull oddes.
9 2732 God buy' you Princes all; Ile to my Charge:
9 2733 If we no more meet, till we meet in Heauen;
9 2734 Then ioyfully, my Noble Lord of Bedford,
9 2735 My deare Lord Gloucester, and my good Lord Exeter,
9 2736 And my kind Kinsman, Warriors all, adieu
9 2737 
9 2738    Bedf. Farwell good Salisbury, & good luck go with thee:
9 2739 And yet I doe thee wrong, to mind thee of it,
9 2740 For thou art fram'd of the firme truth of valour
9 2741 
9 2742    Exe. Farwell kind Lord: fight valiantly to day
9 2743 
9 2744    Bedf. He is as full of Valour as of Kindnesse,
9 2745 Princely in both.
9 2746 Enter the King.
9 2747 
9 2748   West. O that we now had here
9 2749 But one ten thousand of those men in England,
9 2750 That doe no worke to day
9 2751 
9 2752    King. What's he that wishes so?
9 2753 My Cousin Westmerland. No, my faire Cousin:
9 2754 If we are markt to dye, we are enow
9 2755 To doe our Countrey losse: and if to liue,
9 2756 The fewer men, the greater share of honour.
9 2757 Gods will, I pray thee wish not one man more.
9 2758 By Ioue, I am not couetous for Gold,
9 2759 Nor care I who doth feed vpon my cost:
9 2760 It yernes me not, if men my Garments weare;
9 2761 Such outward things dwell not in my desires.
9 2762 But if it be a sinne to couet Honor,
9 2763 I am the most offending Soule aliue.
9 2764 No 'faith, my Couze, wish not a man from England:
9 2765 Gods peace, I would not loose so great an Honor,
9 2766 As one man more me thinkes would share from me,
9 2767 For the best hope I haue. O, doe not wish one more:
9 2768 Rather proclaime it (Westmerland) through my Hoast,
9 2769 That he which hath no stomack to this fight,
9 2770 Let him depart, his Pasport shall be made,
9 2771 And Crownes for Conuoy put into his Purse:
9 2772 We would not dye in that mans companie,
9 2773 That feares his fellowship, to dye with vs.
9 2774 This day is call'd the Feast of Crispian:
9 2775 He that out-liues this day, and comes safe home,
9 2776 Will stand a tip-toe when this day is named,
9 2777 And rowse him at the Name of Crispian.
9 2778 He that shall see this day, and liue old age,
9 2779 Will yeerely on the Vigil feast his neighbours,
9 2780 And say, to morrow is Saint Crispian.
9 2781 Then will he strip his sleeue, and shew his skarres:
9 2782 Old men forget; yet all shall be forgot:
9 2783 But hee'le remember, with aduantages,
9 2784 What feats he did that day. Then shall our Names,
9 2785 Familiar in his mouth as household words,
9 2786 Harry the King, Bedford and Exeter,
9 2787 Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester,
9 2788 Be in their flowing Cups freshly remembred.
9 2789 This story shall the good man teach his sonne:
9 2790 And Crispine Crispian shall ne're goe by,
9 2791 From this day to the ending of the World,
9 2792 But we in it shall be remembred;
9 2793 We few, we happy few, we band of brothers:
9 2794 For he to day that sheds his blood with me,
9 2795 Shall be my brother: be he ne're so vile,
9 2796 This day shall gentle his Condition.
9 2797 And Gentlemen in England, now a bed,
9 2798 Shall thinke themselues accurst they were not here;
9 2799 And hold their Manhoods cheape, whiles any speakes,
9 2800 That fought with vs vpon Saint Crispines day.
9 2801 Enter Salisbury.
9 2802 
9 2803   Sal. My Soueraign Lord, bestow your selfe with speed:
9 2804 The French are brauely in their battailes set,
9 2805 And will with all expedience charge on vs
9 2806 
9 2807    King. All things are ready, if our minds be so
9 2808 
9 2809    West. Perish the man, whose mind is backward now
9 2810 
9 2811    King. Thou do'st not wish more helpe from England,
9 2812 Couze?
9 2813   West. Gods will, my Liege, would you and I alone,
9 2814 Without more helpe, could fight this Royall battaile
9 2815 
9 2816    King. Why now thou hast vnwisht fiue thousand men:
9 2817 Which likes me better, then to wish vs one.
9 2818 You know your places: God be with you all.
9 2819 
9 2820 Tucket. Enter Montioy.
9 2821 
9 2822   Mont. Once more I come to know of thee King Harry,
9 2823 If for thy Ransome thou wilt now compound,
9 2824 Before thy most assured Ouerthrow:
9 2825 For certainly, thou art so neere the Gulfe,
9 2826 Thou needs must be englutted. Besides, in mercy
9 2827 The Constable desires thee, thou wilt mind
9 2828 Thy followers of Repentance; that their Soules
9 2829 May make a peacefull and a sweet retyre
9 2830 From off these fields: where (wretches) their poore bodies
9 2831 Must lye and fester
9 2832 
9 2833    King. Who hath sent thee now?
9 2834   Mont. The Constable of France
9 2835 
9 2836    King. I pray thee beare my former Answer back:
9 2837 Bid them atchieue me, and then sell my bones.
9 2838 Good God, why should they mock poore fellowes thus?
9 2839 The man that once did sell the Lyons skin
9 2840 While the beast liu'd, was kill'd with hunting him.
9 2841 A many of our bodyes shall no doubt
9 2842 Find Natiue Graues: vpon the which, I trust
9 2843 Shall witnesse liue in Brasse of this dayes worke.
9 2844 And those that leaue their valiant bones in France,
9 2845 Dying like men, though buryed in your Dunghills,
9 2846 They shall be fam'd: for there the Sun shall greet them,
9 2847 And draw their honors reeking vp to Heauen,
9 2848 Leauing their earthly parts to choake your Clyme,
9 2849 The smell whereof shall breed a Plague in France.
9 2850 Marke then abounding valour in our English:
9 2851 That being dead, like to the bullets crasing,
9 2852 Breake out into a second course of mischiefe,
9 2853 Killing in relapse of Mortalitie.
9 2854 Let me speake prowdly: Tell the Constable,
9 2855 We are but Warriors for the working day:
9 2856 Our Gaynesse and our Gilt are all besmyrcht
9 2857 With raynie Marching in the painefull field.
9 2858 There's not a piece of feather in our Hoast:
9 2859 Good argument (I hope) we will not flye:
9 2860 And time hath worne vs into slouenrie.
9 2861 But by the Masse, our hearts are in the trim:
9 2862 And my poore Souldiers tell me, yet ere Night,
9 2863 They'le be in fresher Robes, or they will pluck
9 2864 The gay new Coats o're the French Souldiers heads,
9 2865 And turne them out of seruice. If they doe this,
9 2866 As if God please, they shall; my Ransome then
9 2867 Will soone be leuyed.
9 2868 Herauld, saue thou thy labour:
9 2869 Come thou no more for Ransome, gentle Herauld,
9 2870 They shall haue none, I sweare, but these my ioynts:
9 2871 Which if they haue, as I will leaue vm them,
9 2872 Shall yeeld them little, tell the Constable
9 2873 
9 2874    Mont. I shall, King Harry. And so fare thee well:
9 2875 Thou neuer shalt heare Herauld any more.
9 2876 Enter.
9 2877 
9 2878   King. I feare thou wilt once more come againe for a
9 2879 Ransome.
9 2880 Enter Yorke.
9 2881 
9 2882   Yorke. My Lord, most humbly on my knee I begge
9 2883 The leading of the Vaward
9 2884 
9 2885    King. Take it, braue Yorke.
9 2886 Now Souldiers march away,
9 2887 And how thou pleasest God, dispose the day.

9 2889 Exeunt.

9 2904 Dewe, thou dyest on point of Fox, except O Signieur

9 2916 Goat, offer'st me Brasse?

9 2931    Boy. I doe not know the French for fer, and ferret, and

9 2934    Pist. Bid him prepare, for I will cut his throat
9 2935

9 2978 I did neuer know so full a voyce issue from so emptie a
9 2979 heart: but the saying is true, The empty vessel makes the
9 2980 greatest sound, Bardolfe and Nym had tenne times more
9 2981 valour, then this roaring diuell i'th olde play, that euerie
9 2982 one may payre his nayles with a woodden dagger, and
9 2983 they are both hang'd, and so would this be, if hee durst
9 2984 steale any thing aduenturously. I must stay with the
9 2985 Lackies with the luggage of our camp, the French might
9 2986 haue a good pray of vs, if he knew of it, for there is none
9 2987 to guard it but boyes.
9 2988 Enter.
9 2989 
9 2990 Enter Constable, Orleance, Burbon, Dolphin, and Rambures.

9 2995 
9 2996    Dol. Mor Dieu ma vie, all is confounded all,
9 2997 Reproach, and euerlasting shame
9 2998 Sits mocking in our Plumes.
9 2999

9 3001 
9 3002 O meschante Fortune, do not runne away
9 3003 
9 3004    Con. Why all our rankes are broke
9 3005 
9 3006    Dol. O perdurable shame, let's stab our selues:
9 3007 Be these the wretches that we plaid at dice for?
9 3008   Orl. Is this the King we sent too, for his ransome?
9 3009   Bur. Shame, and eternall shame, nothing but shame,
9 3010 Let vs dye in once more backe againe,
9 3011 And he that will not follow Burbon now,
9 3012 Let him go hence, and with his cap in hand
9 3013 Like a base Pander hold the Chamber doore,
9 3014 Whilst a base slaue, no gentler then my dogge,
9 3015 His fairest daughter is contaminated
9 3016

9 3018 Let vs on heapes go offer vp our liues
9 3019 
9 3020    Orl. We are enow yet liuing in the Field,
9 3021 To smother vp the English in our throngs,
9 3022 If any order might be thought vpon
9 3023 
9 3024    Bur. The diuell take Order now, Ile to the throng;
9 3025 Let life be short, else shame will be too long.
9 3026 Enter.
9 3027 
9 3028 Alarum. Enter the King and his trayne, with Prisoners.
9 3029 
9 3030   King. Well haue we done, thrice-valiant Countrimen,
9 3031 But all's not done, yet keepe the French the field
9 3032 
9 3033    Exe. The D[uke]. of York commends him to your Maiesty
9 3034   King. Liues he good Vnckle: thrice within this houre
9 3035 I saw him downe; thrice vp againe, and fighting,
9 3036 From Helmet to the spurre, all blood he was
9 3037 
9 3038    Exe. In which array (braue Soldier) doth he lye,
9 3039 Larding the plaine: and by his bloody side,
9 3040 (Yoake-fellow to his honour-owing-wounds)
9 3041 The Noble Earle of Suffolke also lyes.
9 3042 Suffolke first dyed, and Yorke all hagled ouer
9 3043 Comes to him, where in gore he lay insteeped,
9 3044 And takes him by the Beard, kisses the gashes
9 3045 That bloodily did yawne vpon his face.
9 3046 He cryes aloud; Tarry my Cosin Suffolke,
9 3047 My soule shall thine keepe company to heauen:
9 3048 Tarry (sweet soule) for mine, then flye a-brest:
9 3049 As in this glorious and well-foughten field
9 3050 We kept together in our Chiualrie.
9 3051 Vpon these words I came, and cheer'd him vp,
9 3052 He smil'd me in the face, raught me his hand,
9 3053 And with a feeble gripe, sayes: Deere my Lord,
9 3054 Commend my seruice to my Soueraigne,
9 3055 So did he turne, and ouer Suffolkes necke
9 3056 He threw his wounded arme, and kist his lippes,
9 3057 And so espous'd to death, with blood he seal'd
9 3058 A Testament of Noble-ending-loue:
9 3059 The prettie and sweet manner of it forc'd
9 3060 Those waters from me, which I would haue stop'd,
9 3061 But I had not so much of man in mee,
9 3062 And all my mother came into mine eyes,
9 3063 And gaue me vp to teares
9 3064 
9 3065    King. I blame you not,
9 3066 For hearing this, I must perforce compound
9 3067 With mixtfull eyes, or they will issue to.
9 3068 
9 3069 Alarum
9 3070 
9 3071 But hearke, what new alarum is this same?
9 3072 The French haue re-enforc'd their scatter'd men:
9 3073 Then euery souldiour kill his Prisoners,
9 3074 Giue the word through.
9 3075 
9 3076 Exit
9 3077 
9 3078 
9 3079 Actus Quartus.
9 3080 
9 3081 Enter Fluellen and Gower.
9 3082 
9 3083   Flu. Kill the poyes and the luggage, 'Tis expressely
9 3084 against the Law of Armes, tis as arrant a peece of knauery
9 3085 marke you now, as can bee offert in your Conscience
9 3086 now, is it not?
9 3087   Gow. Tis certaine, there's not a boy left aliue, and the
9 3088 Cowardly Rascalls that ranne from the battaile ha' done
9 3089 this slaughter: besides they haue burned and carried away
9 3090 all that was in the Kings Tent, wherefore the King
9 3091 most worthily hath caus'd euery soldiour to cut his prisoners
9 3092 throat. O 'tis a gallant King
9 3093 
9 3094    Flu. I, hee was porne at Monmouth Captaine Gower:
9 3095 What call you the Townes name where Alexander the
9 3096 pig was borne?
9 3097   Gow. Alexander the Great
9 3098 
9 3099    Flu. Why I pray you, is not pig, great? The pig, or
9 3100 the great, or the mighty, or the huge, or the magnanimous,
9 3101 are all one reckonings, saue the phrase is a litle variations
9 3102 
9 3103    Gower. I thinke Alexander the Great was borne in
9 3104 Macedon, his Father was called Phillip of Macedon, as I
9 3105 take it
9 3106 
9 3107    Flu. I thinke it is in Macedon where Alexander is
9 3108 porne: I tell you Captaine, if you looke in the Maps of
9 3109 the Orld, I warrant you sall finde in the comparisons betweene
9 3110 Macedon & Monmouth, that the situations looke
9 3111 you, is both alike. There is a Riuer in Macedon, & there
9 3112 is also moreouer a Riuer at Monmouth, it is call'd Wye at
9 3113 Monmouth: but it is out of my praines, what is the name
9 3114 of the other Riuer: but 'tis all one, tis alike as my fingers
9 3115 is to my fingers, and there is Salmons in both. If you
9 3116 marke Alexanders life well, Harry of Monmouthes life is
9 3117 come after it indifferent well, for there is figures in all
9 3118 things. Alexander God knowes, and you know, in his
9 3119 rages, and his furies, and his wraths, and his chollers, and
9 3120 his moodes, and his displeasures, and his indignations,
9 3121 and also being a little intoxicates in his praines, did in
9 3122 his Ales and his angers (looke you) kill his best friend
9 3123 Clytus
9 3124 
9 3125    Gow. Our King is not like him in that, he neuer kill'd
9 3126 any of his friends
9 3127 
9 3128    Flu. It is not well done (marke you now) to take the
9 3129 tales out of my mouth, ere it is made and finished. I speak
9 3130 but in the figures, and comparisons of it: as Alexander
9 3131 kild his friend Clytus, being in his Ales and his Cuppes; so
9 3132 also Harry Monmouth being in his right wittes, and his
9 3133 good iudgements, turn'd away the fat Knight with the
9 3134 great belly doublet: he was full of iests, and gypes, and
9 3135 knaueries, and mockes, I haue forgot his name
9 3136 
9 3137    Gow. Sir Iohn Falstaffe
9 3138 
9 3139    Flu. That is he: Ile tell you, there is good men porne
9 3140 at Monmouth
9 3141 
9 3142    Gow. Heere comes his Maiesty.
9 3143 
9 3144 Alarum. Enter King Harry and Burbon with prisoners. Flourish.
9 3145 
9 3146   King. I was not angry since I came to France,
9 3147 Vntill this instant. Take a Trumpet Herald,
9 3148 Ride thou vnto the Horsemen on yond hill:
9 3149 If they will fight with vs, bid them come downe,
9 3150 Or voyde the field: they do offend our sight.
9 3151 If they'l do neither, we will come to them,
9 3152 And make them sker away, as swift as stones
9 3153 Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
9 3154 Besides, wee'l cut the throats of those we haue,
9 3155 And not a man of them that we shall take,
9 3156 Shall taste our mercy. Go and tell them so.
9 3157 Enter Montioy.
9 3158 
9 3159   Exe. Here comes the Herald of the French, my Liege
9 3160   Glou. His eyes are humbler then they vs'd to be
9 3161 
9 3162    King. How now, what meanes this Herald? Knowst
9 3163 thou not,
9 3164 That I haue fin'd these bones of mine for ransome?
9 3165 Com'st thou againe for ransome?
9 3166   Her. No great King:
9 3167 I come to thee for charitable License,
9 3168 That we may wander ore this bloody field,
9 3169 To booke our dead, and then to bury them,
9 3170 To sort our Nobles from our common men.
9 3171 For many of our Princes (woe the while)
9 3172 Lye drown'd and soak'd in mercenary blood:
9 3173 So do our vulgar drench their peasant limbes
9 3174 In blood of Princes, and with wounded steeds
9 3175 Fret fet-locke deepe in gore, and with wilde rage
9 3176 Yerke out their armed heeles at their dead masters,
9 3177 Killing them twice. O giue vs leaue great King,
9 3178 To view the field in safety, and dispose
9 3179 Of their dead bodies
9 3180 
9 3181    Kin. I tell thee truly Herald,
9 3182 I know not if the day be ours or no,
9 3183 For yet a many of your horsemen peere,
9 3184 And gallop ore the field
9 3185 
9 3186    Her. The day is yours
9 3187 
9 3188    Kin. Praised be God, and not our strength for it:
9 3189 What is this Castle call'd that stands hard by
9 3190 
9 3191    Her. They call it Agincourt
9 3192 
9 3193    King. Then call we this the field of Agincourt,
9 3194 Fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus
9 3195 
9 3196    Flu. Your Grandfather of famous memory (an't please
9 3197 your Maiesty) and your great Vncle Edward the Placke
9 3198 Prince of Wales, as I haue read in the Chronicles, fought
9 3199 a most praue pattle here in France
9 3200 
9 3201    Kin. They did Fluellen
9 3202 
9 3203    Flu. Your Maiesty sayes very true: If your Maiesties
9 3204 is remembred of it, the Welchmen did good seruice in a
9 3205 Garden where Leekes did grow, wearing Leekes in their
9 3206 Monmouth caps, which your Maiesty know to this houre
9 3207 is an honourable badge of the seruice: And I do beleeue
9 3208 your Maiesty takes no scorne to weare the Leeke vppon
9 3209 S[aint]. Tauies day
9 3210 
9 3211    King. I weare it for a memorable honor:
9 3212 For I am Welch you know good Countriman
9 3213 
9 3214    Flu. All the water in Wye, cannot wash your Maiesties
9 3215 Welsh plood out of your pody, I can tell you that:
9 3216 God plesse it, and preserue it, as long as it pleases his
9 3217 Grace, and his Maiesty too
9 3218 
9 3219    Kin. Thankes good my Countrymen
9 3220 
9 3221    Flu. By Ieshu, I am your Maiesties Countreyman, I
9 3222 care not who know it: I will confesse it to all the Orld, I
9 3223 need not to be ashamed of your Maiesty, praised be God
9 3224 so long as your Maiesty is an honest man
9 3225 
9 3226    King. Good keepe me so.
9 3227 Enter Williams.
9 3228 
9 3229 Our Heralds go with him,
9 3230 Bring me iust notice of the numbers dead
9 3231 On both our parts. Call yonder fellow hither
9 3232 
9 3233    Exe. Souldier, you must come to the King
9 3234 
9 3235    Kin. Souldier, why wear'st thou that Gloue in thy
9 3236 Cappe?
9 3237   Will. And't please your Maiesty, tis the gage of one
9 3238 that I should fight withall, if he be aliue
9 3239 
9 3240    Kin. An Englishman?
9 3241   Wil. And't please your Maiesty, a Rascall that swagger'd
9 3242 with me last night: who if aliue, and euer dare to
9 3243 challenge this Gloue, I haue sworne to take him a boxe
9 3244 a'th ere: or if I can see my Gloue in his cappe, which he
9 3245 swore as he was a Souldier he would weare (if aliue) I wil
9 3246 strike it out soundly
9 3247 
9 3248    Kin. What thinke you Captaine Fluellen, is it fit this
9 3249 souldier keepe his oath
9 3250 
9 3251    Flu. Hee is a Crauen and a Villaine else, and't please
9 3252 your Maiesty in my conscience
9 3253 
9 3254    King. It may bee, his enemy is a Gentleman of great
9 3255 sort quite from the answer of his degree
9 3256 
9 3257    Flu. Though he be as good a Ientleman as the diuel is,
9 3258 as Lucifer and Belzebub himselfe, it is necessary (looke
9 3259 your Grace) that he keepe his vow and his oath: If hee
9 3260 bee periur'd (see you now) his reputation is as arrant a
9 3261 villaine and a Iacke sawce, as euer his blacke shoo trodd
9 3262 vpon Gods ground, and his earth, in my conscience law
9 3263   King. Then keepe thy vow sirrah, when thou meet'st
9 3264 the fellow
9 3265 
9 3266    Wil. So, I wil my Liege, as I liue
9 3267

9 3271    Flu. Gower is a good Captaine, and is good knowledge
9 3272 and literatured in the Warres
9 3273 
9 3274    King. Call him hither to me, Souldier
9 3275 
9 3276    Will. I will my Liege.
9 3277 Enter.
9 3278 
9 3279   King. Here Fluellen, weare thou this fauour for me, and
9 3280 sticke it in thy Cappe: when Alanson and my selfe were
9 3281 downe together, I pluckt this Gloue from his Helme: If
9 3282 any man challenge this, hee is a friend to Alanson, and an
9 3283 enemy to our Person; if thou encounter any such, apprehend
9 3284 him, and thou do'st me loue
9 3285 
9 3286    Flu. Your Grace doo's me as great Honors as can be
9 3287 desir'd in the hearts of his Subiects: I would faine see
9 3288 the man, that ha's but two legges, that shall find himselfe
9 3289 agreefd at this Gloue; that is all: but I would faine see
9 3290 it once, and please God of his grace that I might see
9 3291 
9 3292    King. Know'st thou Gower?
9 3293   Flu. He is my deare friend, and please you
9 3294 
9 3295    King. Pray thee goe seeke him, and bring him to my
9 3296 Tent
9 3297 
9 3298    Flu. I will fetch him.
9 3299 Enter.
9 3300 
9 3301   King. My Lord of Warwick, and my Brother Gloster,
9 3302 Follow Fluellen closely at the heeles.
9 3303 The Gloue which I haue giuen him for a fauour,
9 3304 May haply purchase him a box a'th' eare.
9 3305 It is the Souldiers: I by bargaine should
9 3306 Weare it my selfe. Follow good Cousin Warwick:
9 3307 If that the Souldier strike him, as I iudge
9 3308 By his blunt bearing, he will keepe his word;
9 3309 Some sodaine mischiefe may arise of it:
9 3310 For I doe know Fluellen valiant,
9 3311 And toucht with Choler, hot as Gunpowder,
9 3312 And quickly will returne an iniurie.
9 3313 Follow, and see there be no harme betweene them.

9 3328    Will. Sir, know you this Gloue?
9 3329   Flu. Know the Gloue? I know the Gloue is a Gloue
9 3330 
9 3331    Will. I know this, and thus I challenge it.
9 3332 
9 3333 Strikes him.

9 3336 World, or in France, or in England
9 3337 
9 3338    Gower. How now Sir? you Villaine
9 3339 
9 3340    Will. Doe you thinke Ile be forsworne?

9 3342 his payment into plowes, I warrant you
9 3343 
9 3344    Will. I am no Traytor
9 3345

9 3348 Alansons.
9 3349 Enter Warwick and Gloucester.

9 3364 of it: and he that I gaue it to in change, promis'd to weare
9 3365 it in his Cappe: I promis'd to strike him, if he did: I met
9 3366 this man with my Gloue in his Cappe, and I haue been as

9 3386 came any from mine, that might offend your Maiestie
9 3387 
9 3388    King. It was our selfe thou didst abuse
9 3389 
9 3390    Will. Your Maiestie came not like your selfe: you
9 3391 appear'd to me but as a common man; witnesse the
9 3392 Night, your Garments, your Lowlinesse: and what
9 3393 your Highnesse suffer'd vnder that shape, I beseech you
9 3394 take it for your owne fault, and not mine: for had you
9 3395 beene as I tooke you for, I made no offence; therefore I

9 3405 enough in his belly: Hold, there is twelue-pence for
9 3406 you, and I pray you to serue God, and keepe you out of
9 3407 prawles and prabbles, and quarrels and dissentions, and I
9 3408 warrant you it is the better for you
9 3409

9 3461 On one part and on th' other, take it God,

9 3463 
9 3464    Exet. 'Tis wonderfull
9 3465

9 3468 To boast of this, or take that prayse from God,

9 3496 Be here presented. Now we beare the King
9 3497 Toward Callice: Graunt him there; there seene,
9 3498 Heaue him away vpon your winged thoughts,
9 3499 Athwart the Sea: Behold the English beach
9 3500 Pales in the flood; with Men, Wiues, and Boyes,
9 3501 Whose shouts & claps out-voyce the deep-mouth'd Sea,
9 3502 Which like a mightie Whiffler 'fore the King,
9 3503 Seemes to prepare his way: So let him land,
9 3504 And solemnly see him set on to London.
9 3505 So swift a pace hath Thought, that euen now
9 3506 You may imagine him vpon Black-Heath:
9 3507 Where, that his Lords desire him, to haue borne
9 3508 His bruised Helmet, and his bended Sword
9 3509 Before him, through the Citie: he forbids it,
9 3510 Being free from vainnesse, and selfe-glorious pride;
9 3511 Giuing full Trophee, Signall, and Ostent,
9 3512 Quite from himselfe, to God. But now behold,
9 3513 In the quick Forge and working-house of Thought,
9 3514 How London doth powre out her Citizens,
9 3515 The Maior and all his Brethren in best sort,
9 3516 Like to the Senatours of th' antique Rome,
9 3517 With the Plebeians swarming at their heeles,
9 3518 Goe forth and fetch their Conqu'ring Cæsar in:
9 3519 As by a lower, but by louing likelyhood,
9 3520 Were now the Generall of our gracious Empresse,
9 3521 As in good time he may, from Ireland comming,
9 3522 Bringing Rebellion broached on his Sword;
9 3523 How many would the peacefull Citie quit,
9 3524 To welcome him? much more, and much more cause,
9 3525 Did they this Harry. Now in London place him.
9 3526 As yet the lamentation of the French
9 3527 Inuites the King of Englands stay at home:
9 3528 The Emperour's comming in behalfe of France,
9 3529 To order peace betweene them: and omit
9 3530 All the occurrences, what euer chanc't,
9 3531 Till Harryes backe returne againe to France:
9 3532 There must we bring him; and my selfe haue play'd
9 3533 The interim, by remembring you 'tis past.
9 3534 Then brooke abridgement, and your eyes aduance,
9 3535 After your thoughts, straight backe againe to France.
9 3536 Enter.
9 3537 
9 3538 Enter Fluellen and Gower.
9 3539 
9 3540   Gower. Nay, that's right: but why weare you your
9 3541 Leeke to day? S[aint]. Dauies day is past
9 3542 
9 3543    Flu. There is occasions and causes why and wherefore
9 3544 in all things: I will tell you asse my friend, Captaine
9 3545 Gower; the rascally, scauld, beggerly, lowsie, pragging
9 3546 Knaue Pistoll, which you and your selfe, and all the World,
9 3547 know to be no petter then a fellow, looke you now, of no
9 3548 merits: hee is come to me, and prings me pread and
9 3549 sault yesterday, looke you, and bid me eate my Leeke:
9 3550 it was in a place where I could not breed no contention
9 3551 with him; but I will be so bold as to weare it in my Cap
9 3552 till I see him once againe, and then I will tell him a little
9 3553 piece of my desires.
9 3554 Enter Pistoll.
9 3555 
9 3556   Gower. Why heere hee comes, swelling like a Turkycock
9 3557 
9 3558    Flu. 'Tis no matter for his swellings, nor his Turkycocks.
9 3559 God plesse you aunchient Pistoll: you scuruie lowsie
9 3560 Knaue, God plesse you
9 3561 
9 3562    Pist. Ha, art thou bedlam? doest thou thirst, base
9 3563 Troian, to haue me fold vp Parcas fatall Web? Hence;
9 3564 I am qualmish at the smell of Leeke
9 3565 
9 3566    Flu. I peseech you heartily, scuruie lowsie Knaue, at
9 3567 my desires, and my requests, and my petitions, to eate,
9 3568 looke you, this Leeke; because, looke you, you doe not
9 3569 loue it, nor your affections, and your appetites and your
9 3570 disgestions doo's not agree with it, I would desire you
9 3571 to eate it
9 3572 
9 3573    Pist. Not for Cadwallader and all his Goats
9 3574 
9 3575    Flu. There is one Goat for you.
9 3576 
9 3577  Strikes him.
9 3578 
9 3579 Will you be so good, scauld Knaue, as eate it?
9 3580   Pist. Base Troian, thou shalt dye
9 3581 
9 3582    Flu. You say very true, scauld Knaue, when Gods
9 3583 will is: I will desire you to liue in the meane time, and
9 3584 eate your Victuals: come, there is sawce for it. You
9 3585 call'd me yesterday Mountaine-Squier, but I will make
9 3586 you to day a squire of low degree. I pray you fall too, if
9 3587 you can mocke a Leeke, you can eate a Leeke
9 3588 
9 3589    Gour. Enough Captaine, you haue astonisht him
9 3590 
9 3591    Flu. I say, I will make him eate some part of my leeke,
9 3592 or I will peate his pate foure dayes: bite I pray you, it is
9 3593 good for your greene wound, and your ploodie Coxecombe
9 3594 
9 3595    Pist. Must I bite
9 3596 
9 3597    Flu. Yes certainly, and out of doubt and out of question
9 3598 too, and ambiguities
9 3599 
9 3600    Pist. By this Leeke, I will most horribly reuenge I
9 3601 eate and eate I sweare
9 3602 
9 3603    Flu. Eate I pray you, will you haue some more sauce
9 3604 to your Leeke: there is not enough Leeke to sweare by
9 3605 
9 3606    Pist. Quiet thy Cudgell, thou dost see I eate
9 3607 
9 3608    Flu. Much good do you scald knaue, heartily. Nay,
9 3609 pray you throw none away, the skinne is good for your
9 3610 broken Coxcombe; when you take occasions to see
9 3611 Leekes heereafter, I pray you mocke at 'em, that is all
9 3612 
9 3613    Pist. Good
9 3614 
9 3615    Flu. I, Leekes is good: hold you, there is a groat to
9 3616 heale your pate
9 3617 
9 3618    Pist. Me a groat?
9 3619   Flu. Yes verily, and in truth you shall take it, or I haue
9 3620 another Leeke in my pocket, which you shall eate
9 3621 
9 3622    Pist. I take thy groat in earnest of reuenge
9 3623 
9 3624    Flu. If I owe you any thing, I will pay you in Cudgels,
9 3625 you shall be a Woodmonger, and buy nothing of
9 3626 me but cudgels: God bu'y you, and keepe you, & heale
9 3627 your pate.
9 3628 
9 3629 Exit
9 3630 
9 3631   Pist. All hell shall stirre for this
9 3632 
9 3633    Gow. Go, go, you are a counterfeit cowardly Knaue,
9 3634 will you mocke at an ancient Tradition began vppon an
9 3635 honourable respect, and worne as a memorable Trophee
9 3636 of predeceased valor, and dare not auouch in your deeds
9 3637 any of your words. I haue seene you gleeking & galling
9 3638 at this Gentleman twice or thrice. You thought, because
9 3639 he could not speake English in the natiue garb, he could
9 3640 not therefore handle an English Cudgell: you finde it otherwise,
9 3641 and henceforth let a Welsh correction, teach
9 3642 you a good English condition, fare ye well.
9 3643 
9 3644 Exit
9 3645 
9 3646   Pist. Doeth fortune play the huswife with me now?
9 3647 Newes haue I that my Doll is dead i'th Spittle of a malady
9 3648 of France, and there my rendeuous is quite cut off:
9 3649 Old I do waxe, and from my wearie limbes honour is
9 3650 Cudgeld. Well, Baud Ile turne, and something leane to
9 3651 Cut-purse of quicke hand: To England will I steale, and
9 3652 there Ile steale:
9 3653 And patches will I get vnto these cudgeld scarres,
9 3654 And swore I got them in the Gallia warres.
9 3655 Enter.
9 3656 
9 3657 Enter at one doore, King Henry, Exeter, Bedford, Warwicke, and
9 3658 other
9 3659 Lords. At another, Queene Isabel, the King, the Duke of
9 3660 Bourgougne, and
9 3661 other French.
9 3662 
9 3663   King. Peace to this meeting, wherefore we are met;
9 3664 Vnto our brother France, and to our Sister
9 3665 Health and faire time of day: Ioy and good wishes
9 3666 To our most faire and Princely Cosine Katherine:
9 3667 And as a branch and member of this Royalty,
9 3668 By whom this great assembly is contriu'd,
9 3669 We do salute you Duke of Burgogne,
9 3670 And Princes French and Peeres health to you all
9 3671 
9 3672    Fra. Right ioyous are we to behold your face,
9 3673 Most worthy brother England, fairely met,
9 3674 So are you Princes (English) euery one
9 3675 
9 3676    Quee. So happy be the Issue brother Ireland
9 3677 Of this good day, and of this gracious meeting,
9 3678 As we are now glad to behold your eyes,
9 3679 Your eyes which hitherto haue borne
9 3680 In them against the French that met them in their bent,
9 3681 The fatall Balls of murthering Basiliskes:
9 3682 The venome of such Lookes we fairely hope
9 3683 Haue lost their qualitie, and that this day
9 3684 Shall change all griefes and quarrels into loue
9 3685 
9 3686    Eng. To cry Amen to that, thus we appeare
9 3687 
9 3688    Quee. You English Princes all, I doe salute you
9 3689 
9 3690    Burg. My dutie to you both, on equall loue.
9 3691 Great Kings of France and England: that I haue labour'd
9 3692 With all my wits, my paines, and strong endeuors,
9 3693 To bring your most Imperiall Maiesties
9 3694 Vnto this Barre, and Royall enterview;
9 3695 Your Mightinesse on both parts best can witnesse.
9 3696 Since then my Office hath so farre preuayl'd,
9 3697 That Face to Face, and Royall Eye to Eye,
9 3698 You haue congreeted: let it not disgrace me,
9 3699 If I demand before this Royall view,
9 3700 What Rub, or what Impediment there is,
9 3701 Why that the naked, poore, and mangled Peace,
9 3702 Deare Nourse of Arts, Plentyes, and ioyfull Births,
9 3703 Should not in this best Garden of the World,
9 3704 Our fertile France, put vp her louely Visage?
9 3705 Alas, shee hath from France too long been chas'd,
9 3706 And all her Husbandry doth lye on heapes,
9 3707 Corrupting in it owne fertilitie.
9 3708 Her Vine, the merry chearer of the heart,
9 3709 Vnpruned, dyes: her Hedges euen pleach'd,
9 3710 Like Prisoners wildly ouer-growne with hayre,
9 3711 Put forth disorder'd Twigs: her fallow Leas,
9 3712 The Darnell, Hemlock, and ranke Femetary,
9 3713 Doth root vpon; while that the Culter rusts,
9 3714 That should deracinate such Sauagery:
9 3715 The euen Meade, that erst brought sweetly forth
9 3716 The freckled Cowslip, Burnet, and greene Clouer,
9 3717 Wanting the Sythe, withall vncorrected, ranke;
9 3718 Conceiues by idlenesse, and nothing teemes,
9 3719 But hatefull Docks, rough Thistles, Keksyes, Burres,
9 3720 Loosing both beautie and vtilitie;
9 3721 And all our Vineyards, Fallowes, Meades, and Hedges,
9 3722 Defectiue in their natures, grow to wildnesse.
9 3723 Euen so our Houses, and our selues, and Children,
9 3724 Haue lost, or doe not learne, for want of time,
9 3725 The Sciences that should become our Countrey;
9 3726 But grow like Sauages, as Souldiers will,
9 3727 That nothing doe, but meditate on Blood,
9 3728 To Swearing, and sterne Lookes, defus'd Attyre,
9 3729 And euery thing that seemes vnnaturall.
9 3730 Which to reduce into our former fauour,
9 3731 You are assembled: and my speech entreats,
9 3732 That I may know the Let, why gentle Peace
9 3733 Should not expell these inconueniences,
9 3734 And blesse vs with her former qualities
9 3735 
9 3736    Eng. If Duke of Burgonie, you would the Peace,
9 3737 Whose want giues growth to th' imperfections
9 3738 Which you haue cited; you must buy that Peace
9 3739 With full accord to all our iust demands,
9 3740 Whose Tenures and particular effects
9 3741 You haue enschedul'd briefely in your hands
9 3742 
9 3743    Burg. The King hath heard them: to the which, as yet
9 3744 There is no Answer made
9 3745 
9 3746    Eng. Well then: the Peace which you before so vrg'd,
9 3747 Lyes in his Answer
9 3748 
9 3749    France. I haue but with a curselarie eye
9 3750 O're-glanc't the Articles: Pleaseth your Grace
9 3751 To appoint some of your Councell presently
9 3752 To sit with vs once more, with better heed
9 3753 To re-suruey them; we will suddenly
9 3754 Passe our accept and peremptorie Answer
9 3755 
9 3756    England. Brother we shall. Goe Vnckle Exeter,
9 3757 And Brother Clarence, and you Brother Gloucester,
9 3758 Warwick, and Huntington, goe with the King,
9 3759 And take with you free power, to ratifie,
9 3760 Augment, or alter, as your Wisdomes best
9 3761 Shall see aduantageable for our Dignitie,
9 3762 Any thing in or out of our Demands,
9 3763 And wee'le consigne thereto. Will you, faire Sister,
9 3764 Goe with the Princes, or stay here with vs?
9 3765   Quee. Our gracious Brother, I will goe with them:
9 3766 Happily a Womans Voyce may doe some good,
9 3767 When Articles too nicely vrg'd, be stood on
9 3768 
9 3769    England. Yet leaue our Cousin Katherine here with vs,
9 3770 She is our capitall Demand, compris'd
9 3771 Within the fore-ranke of our Articles
9 3772 
9 3773    Quee. She hath good leaue.
9 3774 
9 3775 Exeunt. omnes.
9 3776 
9 3777 Manet King and Katherine
9 3778 
9 3779    King. Faire Katherine, and most faire,
9 3780 Will you vouchsafe to teach a Souldier tearmes,
9 3781 Such as will enter at a Ladyes eare,
9 3782 And pleade his Loue-suit to her gentle heart
9 3783 
9 3784    Kath. Your Maiestie shall mock at me, I cannot speake
9 3785 your England
9 3786 
9 3787    King. O faire Katherine, if you will loue me soundly
9 3788 with your French heart, I will be glad to heare you confesse
9 3789 it brokenly with your English Tongue. Doe you
9 3790 like me, Kate?
9 3791   Kath. Pardonne moy, I cannot tell wat is like me
9 3792 
9 3793    King. An Angell is like you Kate, and you are like an
9 3794 Angell
9 3795 
9 3796    Kath. Que dit il que Ie suis semblable a les Anges?
9 3797   Lady. Ouy verayment (sauf vostre Grace) ainsi dit il
9 3798 
9 3799    King. I said so, deare Katherine, and I must not blush
9 3800 to affirme it
9 3801 
9 3802    Kath. O bon Dieu, les langues des hommes sont plein de
9 3803 tromperies
9 3804 
9 3805    King. What sayes she, faire one? that the tongues of
9 3806 men are full of deceits?
9 3807   Lady. Ouy, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits:
9 3808 dat is de Princesse
9 3809 
9 3810    King. The Princesse is the better English-woman:
9 3811 yfaith Kate, my wooing is fit for thy vnderstanding, I am
9 3812 glad thou canst speake no better English, for if thou
9 3813 could'st, thou would'st finde me such a plaine King, that
9 3814 thou wouldst thinke, I had sold my Farme to buy my
9 3815 Crowne. I know no wayes to mince it in loue, but directly
9 3816 to say, I loue you; then if you vrge me farther,
9 3817 then to say, Doe you in faith? I weare out my suite: Giue
9 3818 me your answer, yfaith doe, and so clap hands, and a bargaine:
9 3819 how say you, Lady?
9 3820   Kath. Sauf vostre honeur, me vnderstand well
9 3821 
9 3822    King. Marry, if you would put me to Verses, or to
9 3823 Dance for your sake, Kate, why you vndid me: for the one
9 3824 I haue neither words nor measure; and for the other, I
9 3825 haue no strength in measure, yet a reasonable measure in
9 3826 strength. If I could winne a Lady at Leape-frogge, or by
9 3827 vawting into my Saddle, with my Armour on my backe;
9 3828 vnder the correction of bragging be it spoken. I should
9 3829 quickly leape into a Wife: Or if I might buffet for my
9 3830 Loue, or bound my Horse for her fauours, I could lay on
9 3831 like a Butcher, and sit like a Iack an Apes, neuer off. But
9 3832 before God Kate, I cannot looke greenely, nor gaspe out
9 3833 my eloquence, nor I haue no cunning in protestation;
9 3834 onely downe-right Oathes, which I neuer vse till vrg'd,
9 3835 nor neuer breake for vrging. If thou canst loue a fellow
9 3836 of this temper, Kate, whose face is not worth Sunne-burning?
9 3837 that neuer lookes in his Glasse, for loue of any
9 3838 thing he sees there? let thine Eye be thy Cooke. I speake
9 3839 to thee plaine Souldier: If thou canst loue me for this,
9 3840 take me? if not? to say to thee that I shall dye, is true; but
9 3841 for thy loue, by the L[ord]. No: yet I loue thee too. And
9 3842 while thou liu'st, deare Kate, take a fellow of plaine and
9 3843 vncoyned Constancie, for he perforce must do thee right,
9 3844 because he hath not the gift to wooe in other places: for
9 3845 these fellowes of infinit tongue, that can ryme themselues
9 3846 into Ladyes fauours, they doe alwayes reason themselues
9 3847 out againe. What? a speaker is but a prater, a Ryme is
9 3848 but a Ballad; a good Legge will fall, a strait Backe will
9 3849 stoope, a blacke Beard will turne white, a curl'd Pate will
9 3850 grow bald, a faire Face will wither, a full Eye will wax
9 3851 hollow: but a good Heart, Kate, is the Sunne and the
9 3852 Moone, or rather the Sunne, and not the Moone; for it
9 3853 shines bright, and neuer changes, but keepes his course
9 3854 truly. If thou would haue such a one, take me? and
9 3855 take me; take a Souldier: take a Souldier; take a King.
9 3856 And what say'st thou then to my Loue? speake my faire,
9 3857 and fairely, I pray thee
9 3858 
9 3859    Kath. Is it possible dat I sould loue de ennemie of
9 3860 Fraunce?
9 3861   King. No, it is not possible you should loue the Enemie
9 3862 of France, Kate; but in louing me, you should loue
9 3863 the Friend of France: for I loue France so well, that I
9 3864 will not part with a Village of it; I will haue it all mine:
9 3865 and Kate, when France is mine, and I am yours; then yours
9 3866 is France, and you are mine
9 3867 
9 3868    Kath. I cannot tell wat is dat
9 3869 
9 3870    King. No, Kate? I will tell thee in French, which I am
9 3871 sure will hang vpon my tongue, like a new-married Wife
9 3872 about her Husbands Necke, hardly to be shooke off; Ie
9 3873 quand sur le possession de Fraunce, & quand vous aues le
9 3874 possession
9 3875 de moy. (Let mee see, what then? Saint Dennis bee
9 3876 my speede) Donc vostre est Fraunce, & vous estes mienne.
9 3877 It is as easie for me, Kate, to conquer the Kingdome, as to
9 3878 speake so much more French: I shall neuer moue thee in
9 3879 French, vnlesse it be to laugh at me
9 3880 
9 3881    Kath. Sauf vostre honeur, le Francois ques vous parleis, il
9 3882 & melieus que l' Anglois le quel Ie parle
9 3883 
9 3884    King. No faith is't not, Kate: but thy speaking of
9 3885 my Tongue, and I thine, most truely falsely, must
9 3886 needes be graunted to be much at one. But Kate, doo'st
9 3887 thou vnderstand thus much English? Canst thou loue
9 3888 mee?
9 3889   Kath. I cannot tell
9 3890 
9 3891    King. Can any of your Neighbours tell, Kate? Ile
9 3892 aske them. Come, I know thou louest me: and at night,
9 3893 when you come into your Closet, you'le question this
9 3894 Gentlewoman about me; and I know, Kate, you will to
9 3895 her disprayse those parts in me, that you loue with your
9 3896 heart: but good Kate, mocke me mercifully, the rather
9 3897 gentle Princesse, because I loue thee cruelly. If euer thou
9 3898 beest mine, Kate, as I haue a sauing Faith within me tells
9 3899 me thou shalt; I get thee with skambling, and thou
9 3900 must therefore needes proue a good Souldier-breeder:
9 3901 Shall not thou and I, betweene Saint Dennis and Saint
9 3902 George, compound a Boy, halfe French halfe English,
9 3903 that shall goe to Constantinople, and take the Turke by
9 3904 the Beard. Shall wee not? what say'st thou, my faire

9 3910 doe but now promise Kate, you will endeauour for your
9 3911 French part of such a Boy; and for my English moytie,

9 3917 deceiue de most sage Damoiseil dat is en Fraunce
9 3918 
9 3919    King. Now fye vpon my false French: by mine Honor
9 3920 in true English, I loue thee Kate; by which Honor, I dare
9 3921 not sweare thou louest me, yet my blood begins to flatter
9 3922 me, that thou doo'st; notwithstanding the poore and
9 3923 vntempering effect of my Visage. Now beshrew my
9 3924 Fathers Ambition, hee was thinking of Ciuill Warres
9 3925 when hee got me, therefore was I created with a stubborne
9 3926 out-side, with an aspect of Iron, that when I come
9 3927 to wooe Ladyes, I fright them: but in faith Kate, the elder
9 3928 I wax, the better I shall appeare. My comfort is, that
9 3929 Old Age, that ill layer vp of Beautie, can doe no more
9 3930 spoyle vpon my Face. Thou hast me, if thou hast me, at
9 3931 the worst; and thou shalt weare me, if thou weare me,
9 3932 better and better: and therefore tell me, most faire Katherine,
9 3933 will you haue me? Put off your Maiden Blushes,
9 3934 auouch the Thoughts of your Heart with the Lookes of
9 3935 an Empresse, take me by the Hand, and say, Harry of
9 3936 England, I am thine: which Word thou shalt no sooner
9 3937 blesse mine Eare withall, but I will tell thee alowd, England
9 3938 is thine, Ireland is thine, France is thine, and Henry
9 3939 Plantaginet is thine; who, though I speake it before his
9 3940 Face, if he be not Fellow with the best King, thou shalt
9 3941 finde the best King of Good-fellowes. Come your Answer
9 3942 in broken Musick; for thy Voyce is Musick, and
9 3943 thy English broken: Therefore Queene of all, Katherine,
9 3944 breake thy minde to me in broken English; wilt thou
9 3945 haue me?
9 3946   Kath. Dat is as it shall please de Roy mon pere
9 3947 
9 3948    King. Nay, it will please him well, Kate; it shall please
9 3949 him, Kate
9 3950 
9 3951    Kath. Den it sall also content me
9 3952 
9 3953    King. Vpon that I kisse your Hand, and I call you my
9 3954 Queene

9 3968 Fraunce; I cannot tell wat is buisse en Anglish
9 3969

9 3971 
9 3972    Lady. Your Maiestee entendre bettre que moy
9 3973 
9 3974    King. It is not a fashion for the Maids in Fraunce to
9 3975 kisse before they are marryed, would she say?
9 3976   Lady. Ouy verayment
9 3977 
9 3978    King. O Kate, nice Customes cursie to great Kings.
9 3979 Deare Kate, you and I cannot bee confin'd within the
9 3980 weake Lyst of a Countreyes fashion: wee are the makers
9 3981 of Manners, Kate; and the libertie that followes
9 3982 our Places, stoppes the mouth of all finde-faults, as I
9 3983 will doe yours, for vpholding the nice fashion of your
9 3984 Countrey, in denying me a Kisse: therefore patiently,
9 3985 and yeelding. You haue Witch-craft in your Lippes,
9 3986 Kate: there is more eloquence in a Sugar touch of
9 3987 them, then in the Tongues of the French Councell; and
9 3988 they should sooner perswade Harry of England, then a
9 3989 generall Petition of Monarchs. Heere comes your
9 3990 Father.
9 3991 Enter the French Power, and the English Lords.
9 3992 
9 3993   Burg. God saue your Maiestie, my Royall Cousin,
9 3994 teach you our Princesse English?
9 3995   King. I would haue her learne, my faire Cousin, how
9 3996 perfectly I loue her, and that is good English
9 3997 
9 3998    Burg. Is shee not apt?
9 3999   King. Our Tongue is rough, Coze, and my Condition
9 4000 is not smooth: so that hauing neyther the Voyce nor
9 4001 the Heart of Flatterie about me, I cannot so coniure vp
9 4002 the Spirit of Loue in her, that hee will appeare in his true
9 4003 likenesse
9 4004 
9 4005    Burg. Pardon the franknesse of my mirth, if I answer
9 4006 you for that. If you would coniure in her, you must
9 4007 make a Circle: if coniure vp Loue in her in his true
9 4008 likenesse, hee must appeare naked, and blinde. Can you
9 4009 blame her then, being a Maid, yet ros'd ouer with the
9 4010 Virgin Crimson of Modestie, if shee deny the apparance
9 4011 of a naked blinde Boy in her naked seeing selfe? It were
9 4012 (my Lord) a hard Condition for a Maid to consigne
9 4013 to
9 4014 
9 4015    King. Yet they doe winke and yeeld, as Loue is blind
9 4016 and enforces
9 4017 
9 4018    Burg. They are then excus'd, my Lord, when they see
9 4019 not what they doe
9 4020 
9 4021    King. Then good my Lord, teach your Cousin to
9 4022 consent winking
9 4023 
9 4024    Burg. I will winke on her to consent, my Lord, if you
9 4025 will teach her to know my meaning: for Maides well
9 4026 Summer'd, and warme kept, are like Flyes at Bartholomew-tyde,
9 4027 blinde, though they haue their eyes, and then
9 4028 they will endure handling, which before would not abide
9 4029 looking on
9 4030 
9 4031    King. This Morall tyes me ouer to Time, and a hot
9 4032 Summer; and so I shall catch the Flye, your Cousin, in
9 4033 the latter end, and she must be blinde to
9 4034 
9 4035    Burg. As Loue is my Lord, before it loues
9 4036 
9 4037    King. It is so: and you may, some of you, thanke
9 4038 Loue for my blindnesse, who cannot see many a faire
9 4039 French Citie for one faire French Maid that stands in my
9 4040 way
9 4041 
9 4042    French King. Yes my Lord, you see them perspectiuely:
9 4043 the Cities turn'd into a Maid; for they are
9 4044 all gyrdled with Maiden Walls, that Warre hath entred
9 4045 
9 4046    England. Shall Kate be my Wife?
9 4047   France. So please you
9 4048 
9 4049    England. I am content, so the Maiden Cities you
9 4050 talke of, may wait on her: so the Maid that stood in
9 4051 the way for my Wish, shall shew me the way to my
9 4052 Will
9 4053 
9 4054    France. Wee haue consented to all tearmes of reason
9 4055 
9 4056    England. Is't so, my Lords of England?
9 4057   West. The King hath graunted euery Article:
9 4058 His Daughter first; and in sequele, all,
9 4059 According to their firme proposed natures
9 4060 
9 4061    Exet. Onely he hath not yet subscribed this:
9 4062 Where your Maiestie demands, That the King of France
9 4063 hauing any occasion to write for matter of Graunt, shall
9 4064 name your Highnesse in this forme, and with this addition,
9 4065 in French: Nostre trescher filz Henry Roy d' Angleterre
9 4066 Heretere de Fraunce: and thus in Latine; Praeclarissimus
9 4067 Filius noster Henricus Rex Angliæ & Heres Franciae
9 4068 
9 4069    France. Nor this I haue not Brother so deny'd,
9 4070 But your request shall make me let it passe
9 4071 
9 4072    England. I pray you then, in loue and deare allyance,
9 4073 Let that one Article ranke with the rest,
9 4074 And thereupon giue me your Daughter
9 4075 
9 4076    France. Take her faire Sonne, and from her blood rayse vp
9 4077 Issue to me, that the contending Kingdomes
9 4078 Of France and England, whose very shoares looke pale,
9 4079 With enuy of each others happinesse,
9 4080 May cease their hatred; and this deare Coniunction
9 4081 Plant Neighbour-hood and Christian-like accord
9 4082 In their sweet Bosomes: that neuer Warre aduance
9 4083 His bleeding Sword 'twixt England and faire France
9 4084 
9 4085    Lords. Amen
9 4086 
9 4087    King. Now welcome Kate: and beare me witnesse all,
9 4088 That here I kisse her as my Soueraigne Queene.
9 4089 
9 4090 Flourish.
9 4091 
9 4092   Quee. God, the best maker of all Marriages,
9 4093 Combine your hearts in one, your Realmes in one:
9 4094 As Man and Wife being two, are one in loue,
9 4095 So be there 'twixt your Kingdomes such a Spousall,
9 4096 That neuer may ill Office, or fell Iealousie,
9 4097 Which troubles oft the Bed of blessed Marriage,
9 4098 Thrust in betweene the Paction of these Kingdomes,
9 4099 To make diuorce of their incorporate League:
9 4100 That English may as French, French Englishmen,
9 4101 Receiue each other. God speake this Amen
9 4102 
9 4103    All. Amen
9 4104 
9 4105    King. Prepare we for our Marriage: on which day,
9 4106 My Lord of Burgundy wee'le take your Oath
9 4107 And all the Peeres, for suretie of our Leagues.
9 4108 Then shall I sweare to Kate, and you to me,
9 4109 And may our Oathes well kept and prosp'rous be.
9 4110 
9 4111 Senet. Exeunt.
9 4112 
9 4113 Enter Chorus.
9 4114 
9 4115 Thus farre with rough, and all-vnable Pen,
9 4116 Our bending Author hath pursu'd the Story,
9 4117 In little roome confining mightie men,
9 4118 Mangling by starts the full course of their glory.
9 4119 Small time: but in that small, most greatly liued
9 4120 This Starre of England. Fortune made his Sword;
9 4121 By which, the Worlds best Garden he atchieued:
9 4122 And of it left his Sonne Imperiall Lord.
9 4123 Henry the Sixt, in Infant Bands crown'd King
9 4124 Of France and England, did this King succeed:
9 4125 Whose State so many had the managing,
9 4126 That they lost France, and made his England bleed:
9 4127 Which oft our Stage hath showne; and for their sake,
9 4128 In your faire minds let this acceptance take.
