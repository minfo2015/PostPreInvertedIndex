1 49                       INDUCTION. SCENE I.
1 50                   Before an alehouse on a heath
1 51 
1 52                       Enter HOSTESS and SLY
1 53 
1 54   SLY. I'll pheeze you, in faith.
1 55   HOSTESS. A pair of stocks, you rogue!
1 56   SLY. Y'are a baggage; the Slys are no rogues. Look in the
1 57     chronicles: we came in with Richard Conqueror. Therefore,
1 58 paucas
1 59     pallabris; let the world slide. Sessa!
1 60   HOSTESS. You will not pay for the glasses you have burst?
1 61   SLY. No, not a denier. Go by, Saint Jeronimy, go to thy cold
1 62 bed
1 63     and warm thee.
1 64   HOSTESS. I know my remedy; I must go fetch the third-borough.
1 65  Exit
1 66   SLY. Third, or fourth, or fifth borough, I'll answer him by
1 67 law.
1 68     I'll not budge an inch, boy; let him come, and kindly.
1 69                                                   [Falls asleep]
1 70 
1 71        Wind horns. Enter a LORD from hunting, with his train
1 72 
1 73   LORD. Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds; 
1 74     Brach Merriman, the poor cur, is emboss'd;
1 75     And couple Clowder with the deep-mouth'd brach.
1 76     Saw'st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good
1 77     At the hedge corner, in the coldest fault?
1 78     I would not lose the dog for twenty pound.
1 79   FIRST HUNTSMAN. Why, Belman is as good as he, my lord;
1 80     He cried upon it at the merest loss,
1 81     And twice to-day pick'd out the dullest scent;
1 82     Trust me, I take him for the better dog.
1 83   LORD. Thou art a fool; if Echo were as fleet,
1 84     I would esteem him worth a dozen such.
1 85     But sup them well, and look unto them all;
1 86     To-morrow I intend to hunt again.
1 87   FIRST HUNTSMAN. I will, my lord.
1 88   LORD. What's here? One dead, or drunk?
1 89     See, doth he breathe?
1 90   SECOND HUNTSMAN. He breathes, my lord. Were he not warm'd with
1 91 ale,
1 92     This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly.
1 93   LORD. O monstrous beast, how like a swine he lies!
1 94     Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image! 
1 95     Sirs, I will practise on this drunken man.
1 96     What think you, if he were convey'd to bed,
1 97     Wrapp'd in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers,
1 98     A most delicious banquet by his bed,
1 99     And brave attendants near him when he wakes,
1 100     Would not the beggar then forget himself?
1 101   FIRST HUNTSMAN. Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose.
1 102   SECOND HUNTSMAN. It would seem strange unto him when he wak'd.
1 103   LORD. Even as a flatt'ring dream or worthless fancy.
1 104     Then take him up, and manage well the jest:
1 105     Carry him gently to my fairest chamber,
1 106     And hang it round with all my wanton pictures;
1 107     Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters,
1 108     And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet;
1 109     Procure me music ready when he wakes,
1 110     To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound;
1 111     And if he chance to speak, be ready straight,
1 112     And with a low submissive reverence
1 113     Say 'What is it your honour will command?'
1 114     Let one attend him with a silver basin 
1 115     Full of rose-water and bestrew'd with flowers;
1 116     Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper,
1 117     And say 'Will't please your lordship cool your hands?'
1 118     Some one be ready with a costly suit,
1 119     And ask him what apparel he will wear;
1 120     Another tell him of his hounds and horse,
1 121     And that his lady mourns at his disease;
1 122     Persuade him that he hath been lunatic,
1 123     And, when he says he is, say that he dreams,
1 124     For he is nothing but a mighty lord.
1 125     This do, and do it kindly, gentle sirs;
1 126     It will be pastime passing excellent,
1 127     If it be husbanded with modesty.
1 128   FIRST HUNTSMAN. My lord, I warrant you we will play our part
1 129     As he shall think by our true diligence
1 130     He is no less than what we say he is.
1 131   LORD. Take him up gently, and to bed with him;
1 132     And each one to his office when he wakes.
1 133                           [SLY is carried out. A trumpet sounds]
1 134     Sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds- 
1 135                                                     Exit SERVANT
1 136     Belike some noble gentleman that means,
1 137     Travelling some journey, to repose him here.
1 138 
1 139                          Re-enter a SERVINGMAN
1 140 
1 141     How now! who is it?
1 142   SERVANT. An't please your honour, players
1 143     That offer service to your lordship.
1 144   LORD. Bid them come near.
1 145 
1 146                              Enter PLAYERS
1 147 
1 148     Now, fellows, you are welcome.
1 149   PLAYERS. We thank your honour.
1 150   LORD. Do you intend to stay with me to-night?
1 151   PLAYER. So please your lordship to accept our duty.
1 152   LORD. With all my heart. This fellow I remember
1 153     Since once he play'd a farmer's eldest son;
1 154     'Twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well. 
1 155     I have forgot your name; but, sure, that part
1 156     Was aptly fitted and naturally perform'd.
1 157   PLAYER. I think 'twas Soto that your honour means.
1 158   LORD. 'Tis very true; thou didst it excellent.
1 159     Well, you are come to me in happy time,
1 160     The rather for I have some sport in hand
1 161     Wherein your cunning can assist me much.
1 162     There is a lord will hear you play to-night;
1 163     But I am doubtful of your modesties,
1 164     Lest, over-eying of his odd behaviour,
1 165     For yet his honour never heard a play,
1 166     You break into some merry passion
1 167     And so offend him; for I tell you, sirs,
1 168     If you should smile, he grows impatient.
1 169   PLAYER. Fear not, my lord; we can contain ourselves,
1 170     Were he the veriest antic in the world.
1 171   LORD. Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery,
1 172     And give them friendly welcome every one;
1 173     Let them want nothing that my house affords.
1 174                                        Exit one with the PLAYERS 
1 175     Sirrah, go you to Bartholomew my page,
1 176     And see him dress'd in all suits like a lady;
1 177     That done, conduct him to the drunkard's chamber,
1 178     And call him 'madam,' do him obeisance.
1 179     Tell him from me- as he will win my love-
1 180     He bear himself with honourable action,
1 181     Such as he hath observ'd in noble ladies
1 182     Unto their lords, by them accomplished;
1 183     Such duty to the drunkard let him do,
1 184     With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,
1 185     And say 'What is't your honour will command,
1 186     Wherein your lady and your humble wife
1 187     May show her duty and make known her love?'
1 188     And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses,
1 189     And with declining head into his bosom,
1 190     Bid him shed tears, as being overjoyed
1 191     To see her noble lord restor'd to health,
1 192     Who for this seven years hath esteemed him
1 193     No better than a poor and loathsome beggar.
1 194     And if the boy have not a woman's gift 
1 195     To rain a shower of commanded tears,
1 196     An onion will do well for such a shift,
1 197     Which, in a napkin being close convey'd,
1 198     Shall in despite enforce a watery eye.
1 199     See this dispatch'd with all the haste thou canst;
1 200     Anon I'll give thee more instructions.     Exit a SERVINGMAN
1 201     I know the boy will well usurp the grace,
1 202     Voice, gait, and action, of a gentlewoman;
1 203     I long to hear him call the drunkard 'husband';
1 204     And how my men will stay themselves from laughter
1 205     When they do homage to this simple peasant.
1 206     I'll in to counsel them; haply my presence
1 207     May well abate the over-merry spleen,
1 208     Which otherwise would grow into extremes.             Exeunt
1 209 
1 210 SC_2
1 211                             SCENE II.
1 212                A bedchamber in the LORD'S house
1 213 
1 214     Enter aloft SLY, with ATTENDANTS; some with apparel, basin
1 215              and ewer, and other appurtenances; and LORD
1 216 
1 217   SLY. For God's sake, a pot of small ale.
1 218   FIRST SERVANT. Will't please your lordship drink a cup of sack?
1 219   SECOND SERVANT. Will't please your honour taste of these
1 220 conserves?
1 221   THIRD SERVANT. What raiment will your honour wear to-day?
1 222   SLY. I am Christophero Sly; call not me 'honour' nor
1 223 'lordship.' I
1 224     ne'er drank sack in my life; and if you give me any
1 225 conserves,
1 226     give me conserves of beef. Ne'er ask me what raiment I'll
1 227 wear,
1 228     for I have no more doublets than backs, no more stockings
1 229 than
1 230     legs, nor no more shoes than feet- nay, sometime more feet
1 231 than
1 232     shoes, or such shoes as my toes look through the overleather.
1 233   LORD. Heaven cease this idle humour in your honour!
1 234     O, that a mighty man of such descent,
1 235     Of such possessions, and so high esteem,
1 236     Should be infused with so foul a spirit!
1 237   SLY. What, would you make me mad? Am not I Christopher Sly, old
1 238     Sly's son of Burton Heath; by birth a pedlar, by education a 
1 239     cardmaker, by transmutation a bear-herd, and now by present
1 240     profession a tinker? Ask Marian Hacket, the fat ale-wife of
1 241     Wincot, if she know me not; if she say I am not fourteen
1 242 pence on
1 243     the score for sheer ale, score me up for the lying'st knave
1 244 in
1 245     Christendom. What! I am not bestraught.  [Taking a pot of
1 246 ale]
1 247     Here's-
1 248   THIRD SERVANT. O, this it is that makes your lady mourn!
1 249   SECOND SERVANT. O, this is it that makes your servants droop!
1 250   LORD. Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house,
1 251     As beaten hence by your strange lunacy.
1 252     O noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth!
1 253     Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment,
1 254     And banish hence these abject lowly dreams.
1 255     Look how thy servants do attend on thee,
1 256     Each in his office ready at thy beck.
1 257     Wilt thou have music? Hark! Apollo plays,            [Music]
1 258     And twenty caged nightingales do sing.
1 259     Or wilt thou sleep? We'll have thee to a couch
1 260     Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed
1 261     On purpose trimm'd up for Semiramis. 
1 262     Say thou wilt walk: we will bestrew the ground.
1 263     Or wilt thou ride? Thy horses shall be trapp'd,
1 264     Their harness studded all with gold and pearl.
1 265     Dost thou love hawking? Thou hast hawks will soar
1 266     Above the morning lark. Or wilt thou hunt?
1 267     Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them
1 268     And fetch shall echoes from the hollow earth.
1 269   FIRST SERVANT. Say thou wilt course; thy greyhounds are as
1 270 swift
1 271     As breathed stags; ay, fleeter than the roe.
1 272   SECOND SERVANT. Dost thou love pictures? We will fetch thee
1 273       straight
1 274     Adonis painted by a running brook,
1 275     And Cytherea all in sedges hid,
1 276     Which seem to move and wanton with her breath
1 277     Even as the waving sedges play wi' th' wind.
1 278   LORD. We'll show thee lo as she was a maid
1 279     And how she was beguiled and surpris'd,
1 280     As lively painted as the deed was done.
1 281   THIRD SERVANT. Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood,
1 282     Scratching her legs, that one shall swear she bleeds 
1 283     And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep,
1 284     So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.
1 285   LORD. Thou art a lord, and nothing but a lord.
1 286     Thou hast a lady far more beautiful
1 287     Than any woman in this waning age.
1 288   FIRST SERVANT. And, till the tears that she hath shed for thee
1 289     Like envious floods o'er-run her lovely face,
1 290     She was the fairest creature in the world;
1 291     And yet she is inferior to none.
1 292   SLY. Am I a lord and have I such a lady?
1 293     Or do I dream? Or have I dream'd till now?
1 294     I do not sleep: I see, I hear, I speak;
1 295     I smell sweet savours, and I feel soft things.
1 296     Upon my life, I am a lord indeed,
1 297     And not a tinker, nor Christopher Sly.
1 298     Well, bring our lady hither to our sight;
1 299     And once again, a pot o' th' smallest ale.
1 300   SECOND SERVANT. Will't please your Mightiness to wash your
1 301 hands?
1 302     O, how we joy to see your wit restor'd!
1 303     O, that once more you knew but what you are! 
1 304     These fifteen years you have been in a dream;
1 305     Or, when you wak'd, so wak'd as if you slept.
1 306   SLY. These fifteen years! by my fay, a goodly nap.
1 307     But did I never speak of all that time?
1 308   FIRST SERVANT. O, yes, my lord, but very idle words;
1 309     For though you lay here in this goodly chamber,
1 310     Yet would you say ye were beaten out of door;
1 311     And rail upon the hostess of the house,
1 312     And say you would present her at the leet,
1 313     Because she brought stone jugs and no seal'd quarts.
1 314     Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket.
1 315   SLY. Ay, the woman's maid of the house.
1 316   THIRD SERVANT. Why, sir, you know no house nor no such maid,
1 317     Nor no such men as you have reckon'd up,
1 318     As Stephen Sly, and old John Naps of Greece,
1 319     And Peter Turph, and Henry Pimpernell;
1 320     And twenty more such names and men as these,
1 321     Which never were, nor no man ever saw.
1 322   SLY. Now, Lord be thanked for my good amends!
1 323   ALL. Amen. 
1 324 
1 325            Enter the PAGE as a lady, with ATTENDANTS
1 326 
1 327   SLY. I thank thee; thou shalt not lose by it.
1 328   PAGE. How fares my noble lord?
1 329   SLY. Marry, I fare well; for here is cheer enough.
1 330     Where is my wife?
1 331   PAGE. Here, noble lord; what is thy will with her?
1 332   SLY. Are you my wife, and will not call me husband?
1 333     My men should call me 'lord'; I am your goodman.
1 334   PAGE. My husband and my lord, my lord and husband;
1 335     I am your wife in all obedience.
1 336   SLY. I know it well. What must I call her?
1 337   LORD. Madam.
1 338   SLY. Al'ce madam, or Joan madam?
1 339   LORD. Madam, and nothing else; so lords call ladies.
1 340   SLY. Madam wife, they say that I have dream'd
1 341     And slept above some fifteen year or more.
1 342   PAGE. Ay, and the time seems thirty unto me,
1 343     Being all this time abandon'd from your bed. 
1 344   SLY. 'Tis much. Servants, leave me and her alone.
1 345                                                  Exeunt SERVANTS
1 346     Madam, undress you, and come now to bed.
1 347   PAGE. Thrice noble lord, let me entreat of you
1 348     To pardon me yet for a night or two;
1 349     Or, if not so, until the sun be set.
1 350     For your physicians have expressly charg'd,
1 351     In peril to incur your former malady,
1 352     That I should yet absent me from your bed.
1 353     I hope this reason stands for my excuse.
1 354   SLY. Ay, it stands so that I may hardly tarry so long. But I
1 355 would
1 356     be loath to fall into my dreams again. I will therefore tarry
1 357 in
1 358     despite of the flesh and the blood.
1 359 
1 360                        Enter a MESSENGER
1 361 
1 362   MESSENGER. Your honour's players, hearing your amendment,
1 363     Are come to play a pleasant comedy;
1 364     For so your doctors hold it very meet,
1 365     Seeing too much sadness hath congeal'd your blood, 
1 366     And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy.
1 367     Therefore they thought it good you hear a play
1 368     And frame your mind to mirth and merriment,
1 369     Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life.
1 370   SLY. Marry, I will; let them play it. Is not a comonty a
1 371     Christmas gambold or a tumbling-trick?
1 372   PAGE. No, my good lord, it is more pleasing stuff.
1 373   SLY. What, household stuff?
1 374   PAGE. It is a kind of history.
1 375   SLY. Well, we'll see't. Come, madam wife, sit by my side and
1 376 let
1 377     the world slip;-we shall ne'er be younger.
1 378                                                  [They sit down]
1 379 
1 380           A flourish of trumpets announces the play
1 381

1 396 ACT I. SCENE I.
1 397 Padua. A public place
1 398 
1 399 Enter LUCENTIO and his man TRANIO
1 400 
1 401   LUCENTIO. Tranio, since for the great desire I had
1 402     To see fair Padua, nursery of arts,
1 403     I am arriv'd for fruitful Lombardy,
1 404     The pleasant garden of great Italy,
1 405     And by my father's love and leave am arm'd
1 406     With his good will and thy good company,
1 407     My trusty servant well approv'd in all,
1 408     Here let us breathe, and haply institute
1 409     A course of learning and ingenious studies.
1 410     Pisa, renowned for grave citizens,
1 411     Gave me my being and my father first,
1 412     A merchant of great traffic through the world,
1 413     Vincentio, come of the Bentivolii;
1 414     Vincentio's son, brought up in Florence,
1 415     It shall become to serve all hopes conceiv'd,
1 416     To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds.
1 417     And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study, 
1 418     Virtue and that part of philosophy
1 419     Will I apply that treats of happiness
1 420     By virtue specially to be achiev'd.
1 421     Tell me thy mind; for I have Pisa left
1 422     And am to Padua come as he that leaves
1 423     A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep,
1 424     And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.
1 425   TRANIO. Mi perdonato, gentle master mine;
1 426     I am in all affected as yourself;
1 427     Glad that you thus continue your resolve
1 428     To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.
1 429     Only, good master, while we do admire
1 430     This virtue and this moral discipline,
1 431     Let's be no Stoics nor no stocks, I pray,
1 432     Or so devote to Aristotle's checks
1 433     As Ovid be an outcast quite abjur'd.
1 434     Balk logic with acquaintance that you have,
1 435     And practise rhetoric in your common talk;
1 436     Music and poesy use to quicken you;
1 437     The mathematics and the metaphysics, 
1 438     Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you.
1 439     No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en;
1 440     In brief, sir, study what you most affect.
1 441   LUCENTIO. Gramercies, Tranio, well dost thou advise.
1 442     If, Biondello, thou wert come ashore,
1 443     We could at once put us in readiness,
1 444     And take a lodging fit to entertain
1 445     Such friends as time in Padua shall beget.
1 446 
1 447       Enter BAPTISTA with his two daughters, KATHERINA
1 448         and BIANCA; GREMIO, a pantaloon; HORTENSIO,
1 449         suitor to BIANCA. LUCENTIO and TRANIO stand by
1 450 
1 451     But stay awhile; what company is this?
1 452   TRANIO. Master, some show to welcome us to town.
1 453   BAPTISTA. Gentlemen, importune me no farther,
1 454     For how I firmly am resolv'd you know;
1 455     That is, not to bestow my youngest daughter
1 456     Before I have a husband for the elder.
1 457     If either of you both love Katherina, 
1 458     Because I know you well and love you well,
1 459     Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure.
1 460   GREMIO. To cart her rather. She's too rough for me.
1 461     There, there, Hortensio, will you any wife?
1 462   KATHERINA.  [To BAPTISTA]  I pray you, sir, is it your will
1 463     To make a stale of me amongst these mates?
1 464   HORTENSIO. Mates, maid! How mean you that? No mates for you,
1 465     Unless you were of gentler, milder mould.
1 466   KATHERINA. I' faith, sir, you shall never need to fear;
1 467     Iwis it is not halfway to her heart;
1 468     But if it were, doubt not her care should be
1 469     To comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool,
1 470     And paint your face, and use you like a fool.
1 471   HORTENSIO. From all such devils, good Lord deliver us!
1 472   GREMIO. And me, too, good Lord!
1 473   TRANIO. Husht, master! Here's some good pastime toward;
1 474     That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward.
1 475   LUCENTIO. But in the other's silence do I see
1 476     Maid's mild behaviour and sobriety.
1 477     Peace, Tranio! 
1 478   TRANIO. Well said, master; mum! and gaze your fill.
1 479   BAPTISTA. Gentlemen, that I may soon make good
1 480     What I have said- Bianca, get you in;
1 481     And let it not displease thee, good Bianca,
1 482     For I will love thee ne'er the less, my girl.
1 483   KATHERINA. A pretty peat! it is best
1 484     Put finger in the eye, an she knew why.
1 485   BIANCA. Sister, content you in my discontent.
1 486     Sir, to your pleasure humbly I subscribe;
1 487     My books and instruments shall be my company,
1 488     On them to look, and practise by myself.
1 489   LUCENTIO. Hark, Tranio, thou mayst hear Minerva speak!
1 490   HORTENSIO. Signior Baptista, will you be so strange?
1 491     Sorry am I that our good will effects
1 492     Bianca's grief.
1 493   GREMIO. Why will you mew her up,
1 494     Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hell,
1 495     And make her bear the penance of her tongue?
1 496   BAPTISTA. Gentlemen, content ye; I am resolv'd.
1 497     Go in, Bianca.                                   Exit BIANCA 
1 498     And for I know she taketh most delight
1 499     In music, instruments, and poetry,
1 500     Schoolmasters will I keep within my house
1 501     Fit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio,
1 502     Or, Signior Gremio, you, know any such,
1 503     Prefer them hither; for to cunning men
1 504     I will be very kind, and liberal
1 505     To mine own children in good bringing-up;
1 506     And so, farewell. Katherina, you may stay;
1 507     For I have more to commune with Bianca.                 Exit
1 508   KATHERINA. Why, and I trust I may go too, may I not?
1 509     What! shall I be appointed hours, as though, belike,
1 510     I knew not what to take and what to leave? Ha!          Exit
1 511   GREMIO. You may go to the devil's dam; your gifts are so good
1 512     here's none will hold you. There! Love is not so great,
1 513     Hortensio, but we may blow our nails together, and fast it
1 514 fairly
1 515     out; our cake's dough on both sides. Farewell; yet, for the
1 516 love
1 517     I bear my sweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fit
1 518 man
1 519     to teach her that wherein she delights, I will wish him to
1 520 her
1 521     father. 
1 522   HORTENSIO. SO Will I, Signior Gremio; but a word, I pray.
1 523 Though
1 524     the nature of our quarrel yet never brook'd parle, know now,
1 525 upon
1 526     advice, it toucheth us both- that we may yet again have
1 527 access to
1 528     our fair mistress, and be happy rivals in Bianca's love- to
1 529     labour and effect one thing specially.
1 530   GREMIO. What's that, I pray?
1 531   HORTENSIO. Marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.
1 532   GREMIO. A husband? a devil.
1 533   HORTENSIO. I say a husband.
1 534   GREMIO. I say a devil. Think'st thou, Hortensio, though her
1 535 father
1 536     be very rich, any man is so very a fool to be married to
1 537 hell?
1 538   HORTENSIO. Tush, Gremio! Though it pass your patience and mine
1 539 to
1 540     endure her loud alarums, why, man, there be good fellows in
1 541 the
1 542     world, an a man could light on them, would take her with all
1 543     faults, and money enough.
1 544   GREMIO. I cannot tell; but I had as lief take her dowry with
1 545 this
1 546     condition: to be whipp'd at the high cross every morning.
1 547   HORTENSIO. Faith, as you say, there's small choice in rotten
1 548     apples. But, come; since this bar in law makes us friends, it
1 549     shall be so far forth friendly maintain'd till by helping 
1 550     Baptista's eldest daughter to a husband we set his youngest
1 551 free
1 552     for a husband, and then have to't afresh. Sweet Bianca! Happy
1 553 man
1 554     be his dole! He that runs fastest gets the ring. How say you,
1 555     Signior Gremio?
1 556   GREMIO. I am agreed; and would I had given him the best horse
1 557 in
1 558     Padua to begin his wooing that would thoroughly woo her, wed
1 559 her,
1 560     and bed her, and rid the house of her! Come on.
1 561                                      Exeunt GREMIO and HORTENSIO
1 562   TRANIO. I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible
1 563     That love should of a sudden take such hold?
1 564   LUCENTIO. O Tranio, till I found it to be true,
1 565     I never thought it possible or likely.
1 566     But see! while idly I stood looking on,
1 567     I found the effect of love in idleness;
1 568     And now in plainness do confess to thee,
1 569     That art to me as secret and as dear
1 570     As Anna to the Queen of Carthage was-
1 571     Tranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio,
1 572     If I achieve not this young modest girl.
1 573     Counsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst; 
1 574     Assist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt.
1 575   TRANIO. Master, it is no time to chide you now;
1 576     Affection is not rated from the heart;
1 577     If love have touch'd you, nought remains but so:
1 578     'Redime te captum quam queas minimo.'
1 579   LUCENTIO. Gramercies, lad. Go forward; this contents;
1 580     The rest will comfort, for thy counsel's sound.
1 581   TRANIO. Master, you look'd so longly on the maid.
1 582     Perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all.
1 583   LUCENTIO. O, yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,
1 584     Such as the daughter of Agenor had,
1 585     That made great Jove to humble him to her hand,
1 586     When with his knees he kiss'd the Cretan strand.
1 587   TRANIO. Saw you no more? Mark'd you not how her sister
1 588     Began to scold and raise up such a storm
1 589     That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?
1 590   LUCENTIO. Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move,
1 591     And with her breath she did perfume the air;
1 592     Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.
1 593   TRANIO. Nay, then 'tis time to stir him from his trance. 
1 594     I pray, awake, sir. If you love the maid,
1 595     Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands:
1 596     Her elder sister is so curst and shrewd
1 597     That, till the father rid his hands of her,
1 598     Master, your love must live a maid at home;
1 599     And therefore has he closely mew'd her up,
1 600     Because she will not be annoy'd with suitors.
1 601   LUCENTIO. Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father's he!
1 602     But art thou not advis'd he took some care
1 603     To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?
1 604   TRANIO. Ay, marry, am I, sir, and now 'tis plotted.
1 605   LUCENTIO. I have it, Tranio.
1 606   TRANIO. Master, for my hand,
1 607     Both our inventions meet and jump in one.
1 608   LUCENTIO. Tell me thine first.
1 609   TRANIO. You will be schoolmaster,
1 610     And undertake the teaching of the maid-
1 611     That's your device.
1 612   LUCENTIO. It is. May it be done?
1 613   TRANIO. Not possible; for who shall bear your part 
1 614     And be in Padua here Vincentio's son;
1 615     Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends,
1 616     Visit his countrymen, and banquet them?
1 617   LUCENTIO. Basta, content thee, for I have it full.
1 618     We have not yet been seen in any house,
1 619     Nor can we be distinguish'd by our faces
1 620     For man or master. Then it follows thus:
1 621     Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,
1 622     Keep house and port and servants, as I should;
1 623     I will some other be- some Florentine,
1 624     Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa.
1 625     'Tis hatch'd, and shall be so. Tranio, at once
1 626     Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak.
1 627     When Biondello comes, he waits on thee;
1 628     But I will charm him first to keep his tongue.
1 629   TRANIO. So had you need.                [They exchange habits]
1 630     In brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is,
1 631     And I am tied to be obedient-
1 632     For so your father charg'd me at our parting:
1 633     'Be serviceable to my son' quoth he, 
1 634     Although I think 'twas in another sense-
1 635     I am content to be Lucentio,
1 636     Because so well I love Lucentio.
1 637   LUCENTIO. Tranio, be so because Lucentio loves;
1 638     And let me be a slave t' achieve that maid
1 639     Whose sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye.
1 640 
1 641                        Enter BIONDELLO.
1 642 
1 643     Here comes the rogue. Sirrah, where have you been?
1 644   BIONDELLO. Where have I been! Nay, how now! where are you?
1 645     Master, has my fellow Tranio stol'n your clothes?
1 646     Or you stol'n his? or both? Pray, what's the news?
1 647   LUCENTIO. Sirrah, come hither; 'tis no time to jest,
1 648     And therefore frame your manners to the time.
1 649     Your fellow Tranio here, to save my life,
1 650     Puts my apparel and my count'nance on,
1 651     And I for my escape have put on his;
1 652     For in a quarrel since I came ashore
1 653     I kill'd a man, and fear I was descried. 
1 654     Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes,
1 655     While I make way from hence to save my life.
1 656     You understand me?
1 657   BIONDELLO. I, sir? Ne'er a whit.
1 658   LUCENTIO. And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth:
1 659     Tranio is chang'd into Lucentio.
1 660   BIONDELLO. The better for him; would I were so too!
1 661   TRANIO. So could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after,
1 662     That Lucentio indeed had Baptista's youngest daughter.
1 663     But, sirrah, not for my sake but your master's, I advise
1 664     You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies.
1 665     When I am alone, why, then I am Tranio;
1 666     But in all places else your master Lucentio.
1 667   LUCENTIO. Tranio, let's go.
1 668     One thing more rests, that thyself execute-
1 669     To make one among these wooers. If thou ask me why-
1 670     Sufficeth, my reasons are both good and weighty.      Exeunt
1 671 
1 672                  The Presenters above speak
1 673  
1 674   FIRST SERVANT. My lord, you nod; you do not mind the play.
1 675   SLY. Yes, by Saint Anne do I. A good matter, surely; comes
1 676 there
1 677     any more of it?
1 678   PAGE. My lord, 'tis but begun.
1 679   SLY. 'Tis a very excellent piece of work, madam lady
1 680     Would 'twere done!                        [They sit and mark]
1 681 
1 682 
1 683 
1 684 
1 685 SCENE II.
1 686 Padua. Before HORTENSIO'S house
1 687 
1 688 Enter PETRUCHIO and his man GRUMIO
1 689 
1 690   PETRUCHIO. Verona, for a while I take my leave,
1 691     To see my friends in Padua; but of all
1 692     My best beloved and approved friend,
1 693     Hortensio; and I trow this is his house.
1 694     Here, sirrah Grumio, knock, I say.
1 695  GRUMIO. Knock, sir! Whom should I knock?
1 696     Is there any man has rebus'd your worship?
1 697   PETRUCHIO. Villain, I say, knock me here soundly.
1 698   GRUMIO. Knock you here, sir? Why, sir, what am I, sir, that I
1 699     should knock you here, sir?
1 700   PETRUCHIO. Villain, I say, knock me at this gate,
1 701     And rap me well, or I'll knock your knave's pate.
1 702   GRUMIO. My master is grown quarrelsome. I should knock you
1 703 first,
1 704     And then I know after who comes by the worst.
1 705   PETRUCHIO. Will it not be?
1 706     Faith, sirrah, an you'll not knock I'll ring it;
1 707     I'll try how you can sol-fa, and sing it.
1 708                                      [He wrings him by the ears] 
1 709   GRUMIO. Help, masters, help! My master is mad.
1 710   PETRUCHIO. Now knock when I bid you, sirrah villain!
1 711 
1 712                         Enter HORTENSIO
1 713 
1 714   HORTENSIO. How now! what's the matter? My old friend Grumio and
1 715 my
1 716     good friend Petruchio! How do you all at Verona?
1 717   PETRUCHIO. Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?
1 718     'Con tutto il cuore ben trovato' may I say.
1 719   HORTENSIO. Alla nostra casa ben venuto,
1 720     Molto honorato signor mio Petruchio.
1 721     Rise, Grumio, rise; we will compound this quarrel.
1 722   GRUMIO. Nay, 'tis no matter, sir, what he 'leges in Latin. If
1 723 this
1 724     be not a lawful cause for me to leave his service- look you,
1 725 sir:
1 726     he bid me knock him and rap him soundly, sir. Well, was it
1 727 fit
1 728     for a servant to use his master so; being, perhaps, for aught
1 729 I
1 730     see, two and thirty, a pip out?
1 731     Whom would to God I had well knock'd at first,
1 732     Then had not Grumio come by the worst.
1 733   PETRUCHIO. A senseless villain! Good Hortensio, 
1 734     I bade the rascal knock upon your gate,
1 735     And could not get him for my heart to do it.
1 736   GRUMIO. Knock at the gate? O heavens! Spake you not these words
1 737     plain: 'Sirrah knock me here, rap me here, knock me well, and
1 738     knock me soundly'? And come you now with 'knocking at the
1 739 gate'?
1 740   PETRUCHIO. Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you.
1 741   HORTENSIO. Petruchio, patience; I am Grumio's pledge;
1 742     Why, this's a heavy chance 'twixt him and you,
1 743     Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio.
1 744     And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale
1 745     Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?
1 746   PETRUCHIO. Such wind as scatters young men through the world
1 747     To seek their fortunes farther than at home,
1 748     Where small experience grows. But in a few,
1 749     Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:
1 750     Antonio, my father, is deceas'd,
1 751     And I have thrust myself into this maze,
1 752     Haply to wive and thrive as best I may;
1 753     Crowns in my purse I have, and goods at home,
1 754     And so am come abroad to see the world. 
1 755   HORTENSIO. Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee
1 756     And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife?
1 757     Thou'dst thank me but a little for my counsel,
1 758     And yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich,
1 759     And very rich; but th'art too much my friend,
1 760     And I'll not wish thee to her.
1 761   PETRUCHIO. Signior Hortensio, 'twixt such friends as we
1 762     Few words suffice; and therefore, if thou know
1 763     One rich enough to be Petruchio's wife,
1 764     As wealth is burden of my wooing dance,
1 765     Be she as foul as was Florentius' love,
1 766     As old as Sibyl, and as curst and shrewd
1 767     As Socrates' Xanthippe or a worse-
1 768     She moves me not, or not removes, at least,
1 769     Affection's edge in me, were she as rough
1 770     As are the swelling Adriatic seas.
1 771     I come to wive it wealthily in Padua;
1 772     If wealthily, then happily in Padua.
1 773   GRUMIO. Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his mind
1 774 is.
1 775     Why, give him gold enough and marry him to a puppet or an 
1 776     aglet-baby, or an old trot with ne'er a tooth in her head,
1 777 though
1 778     she has as many diseases as two and fifty horses. Why,
1 779 nothing
1 780     comes amiss, so money comes withal.
1 781   HORTENSIO. Petruchio, since we are stepp'd thus far in,
1 782     I will continue that I broach'd in jest.
1 783     I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife
1 784     With wealth enough, and young and beauteous;
1 785     Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman;
1 786     Her only fault, and that is faults enough,
1 787     Is- that she is intolerable curst,
1 788     And shrewd and froward so beyond all measure
1 789     That, were my state far worser than it is,
1 790     I would not wed her for a mine of gold.
1 791   PETRUCHIO. Hortensio, peace! thou know'st not gold's effect.
1 792     Tell me her father's name, and 'tis enough;
1 793     For I will board her though she chide as loud
1 794     As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.
1 795   HORTENSIO. Her father is Baptista Minola,
1 796     An affable and courteous gentleman;
1 797     Her name is Katherina Minola, 
1 798     Renown'd in Padua for her scolding tongue.
1 799   PETRUCHIO. I know her father, though I know not her;
1 800     And he knew my deceased father well.
1 801     I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her;
1 802     And therefore let me be thus bold with you
1 803     To give you over at this first encounter,
1 804     Unless you will accompany me thither.
1 805   GRUMIO. I pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts. O'
1 806 my
1 807     word, and she knew him as well as I do, she would think
1 808 scolding
1 809     would do little good upon him. She may perhaps call him half
1 810 a
1 811     score knaves or so. Why, that's nothing; and he begin once,
1 812 he'll
1 813     rail in his rope-tricks. I'll tell you what, sir: an she
1 814 stand
1 815     him but a little, he will throw a figure in her face, and so
1 816     disfigure her with it that she shall have no more eyes to see
1 817     withal than a cat. You know him not, sir.
1 818   HORTENSIO. Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee,
1 819     For in Baptista's keep my treasure is.
1 820     He hath the jewel of my life in hold,
1 821     His youngest daughter, beautiful Bianca;
1 822     And her withholds from me, and other more, 
1 823     Suitors to her and rivals in my love;
1 824     Supposing it a thing impossible-
1 825     For those defects I have before rehears'd-
1 826     That ever Katherina will be woo'd.
1 827     Therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en,
1 828     That none shall have access unto Bianca
1 829     Till Katherine the curst have got a husband.
1 830   GRUMIO. Katherine the curst!
1 831     A title for a maid of all titles the worst.
1 832   HORTENSIO. Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace,
1 833     And offer me disguis'd in sober robes
1 834     To old Baptista as a schoolmaster
1 835     Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca;
1 836     That so I may by this device at least
1 837     Have leave and leisure to make love to her,
1 838     And unsuspected court her by herself.
1 839 
1 840         Enter GREMIO with LUCENTIO disguised as CAMBIO
1 841 
1 842   GRUMIO. Here's no knavery! See, to beguile the old folks, how
1 843 the 
1 844     young folks lay their heads together! Master, master, look
1 845 about
1 846     you. Who goes there, ha?
1 847   HORTENSIO. Peace, Grumio! It is the rival of my love.
1 848 Petruchio,
1 849     stand by awhile.
1 850   GRUMIO. A proper stripling, and an amorous!
1 851                                               [They stand aside]
1 852   GREMIO. O, very well; I have perus'd the note.
1 853     Hark you, sir; I'll have them very fairly bound-
1 854     All books of love, see that at any hand;
1 855     And see you read no other lectures to her.
1 856     You understand me- over and beside
1 857     Signior Baptista's liberality,
1 858     I'll mend it with a largess. Take your paper too,
1 859     And let me have them very well perfum'd;
1 860     For she is sweeter than perfume itself
1 861     To whom they go to. What will you read to her?
1 862   LUCENTIO. Whate'er I read to her, I'll plead for you
1 863     As for my patron, stand you so assur'd,
1 864     As firmly as yourself were still in place;
1 865     Yea, and perhaps with more successful words 
1 866     Than you, unless you were a scholar, sir.
1 867   GREMIO. O this learning, what a thing it is!
1 868   GRUMIO. O this woodcock, what an ass it is!
1 869   PETRUCHIO. Peace, sirrah!
1 870   HORTENSIO. Grumio, mum!                       [Coming forward]
1 871     God save you, Signior Gremio!
1 872   GREMIO. And you are well met, Signior Hortensio.
1 873     Trow you whither I am going? To Baptista Minola.
1 874     I promis'd to enquire carefully
1 875     About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca;
1 876     And by good fortune I have lighted well
1 877     On this young man; for learning and behaviour
1 878     Fit for her turn, well read in poetry
1 879     And other books- good ones, I warrant ye.
1 880   HORTENSIO. 'Tis well; and I have met a gentleman
1 881     Hath promis'd me to help me to another,
1 882     A fine musician to instruct our mistress;
1 883     So shall I no whit be behind in duty
1 884     To fair Bianca, so beloved of me.
1 885   GREMIO. Beloved of me- and that my deeds shall prove. 
1 886   GRUMIO. And that his bags shall prove.
1 887   HORTENSIO. Gremio, 'tis now no time to vent our love.
1 888     Listen to me, and if you speak me fair
1 889     I'll tell you news indifferent good for either.
1 890     Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met,
1 891     Upon agreement from us to his liking,
1 892     Will undertake to woo curst Katherine;
1 893     Yea, and to marry her, if her dowry please.
1 894   GREMIO. So said, so done, is well.
1 895     Hortensio, have you told him all her faults?
1 896   PETRUCHIO. I know she is an irksome brawling scold;
1 897     If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.
1 898   GREMIO. No, say'st me so, friend? What countryman?
1 899   PETRUCHIO. Born in Verona, old Antonio's son.
1 900     My father dead, my fortune lives for me;
1 901     And I do hope good days and long to see.
1 902   GREMIO. O Sir, such a life with such a wife were strange!
1 903     But if you have a stomach, to't a God's name;
1 904     You shall have me assisting you in all.
1 905     But will you woo this wild-cat? 
1 906   PETRUCHIO. Will I live?
1 907   GRUMIO. Will he woo her? Ay, or I'll hang her.
1 908   PETRUCHIO. Why came I hither but to that intent?
1 909     Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?
1 910     Have I not in my time heard lions roar?
1 911     Have I not heard the sea, puff'd up with winds,
1 912     Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?
1 913     Have I not heard great ordnance in the field,
1 914     And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies?
1 915     Have I not in a pitched battle heard
1 916     Loud 'larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets' clang?
1 917     And do you tell me of a woman's tongue,
1 918     That gives not half so great a blow to hear
1 919     As will a chestnut in a fariner's fire?
1 920     Tush! tush! fear boys with bugs.
1 921   GRUMIO. For he fears none.
1 922   GREMIO. Hortensio, hark:
1 923     This gentleman is happily arriv'd,
1 924     My mind presumes, for his own good and ours.
1 925   HORTENSIO. I promis'd we would be contributors 
1 926     And bear his charge of wooing, whatsoe'er.
1 927   GREMIO. And so we will- provided that he win her.
1 928   GRUMIO. I would I were as sure of a good dinner.
1 929 
1 930     Enter TRANIO, bravely apparelled as LUCENTIO, and BIONDELLO
1 931 
1 932   TRANIO. Gentlemen, God save you! If I may be bold,
1 933     Tell me, I beseech you, which is the readiest way
1 934     To the house of Signior Baptista Minola?
1 935   BIONDELLO. He that has the two fair daughters; is't he you
1 936 mean?
1 937   TRANIO. Even he, Biondello.
1 938   GREMIO. Hark you, sir, you mean not her to-
1 939   TRANIO. Perhaps him and her, sir; what have you to do?
1 940   PETRUCHIO. Not her that chides, sir, at any hand, I pray.
1 941   TRANIO. I love no chiders, sir. Biondello, let's away.
1 942   LUCENTIO.  [Aside]  Well begun, Tranio.
1 943   HORTENSIO. Sir, a word ere you go.
1 944     Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of, yea or no?
1 945   TRANIO. And if I be, sir, is it any offence?
1 946   GREMIO. No; if without more words you will get you hence. 
1 947   TRANIO. Why, sir, I pray, are not the streets as free
1 948     For me as for you?
1 949   GREMIO. But so is not she.
1 950 
1 951   TRANIO. For what reason, I beseech you?
1 952   GREMIO. For this reason, if you'll know,
1 953     That she's the choice love of Signior Gremio.
1 954   HORTENSIO. That she's the chosen of Signior Hortensio.
1 955   TRANIO. Softly, my masters! If you be gentlemen,
1 956     Do me this right- hear me with patience.
1 957     Baptista is a noble gentleman,
1 958     To whom my father is not all unknown,
1 959     And, were his daughter fairer than she is,
1 960     She may more suitors have, and me for one.
1 961     Fair Leda's daughter had a thousand wooers;
1 962     Then well one more may fair Bianca have;
1 963     And so she shall: Lucentio shall make one,
1 964     Though Paris came in hope to speed alone.
1 965   GREMIO. What, this gentleman will out-talk us all!
1 966   LUCENTIO. Sir, give him head; I know he'll prove a jade. 
1 967   PETRUCHIO. Hortensio, to what end are all these words?
1 968   HORTENSIO. Sir, let me be so bold as ask you,
1 969     Did you yet ever see Baptista's daughter?
1 970   TRANIO. No, sir, but hear I do that he hath two:
1 971     The one as famous for a scolding tongue
1 972     As is the other for beauteous modesty.
1 973   PETRUCHIO. Sir, sir, the first's for me; let her go by.
1 974   GREMIO. Yea, leave that labour to great Hercules,
1 975     And let it be more than Alcides' twelve.
1 976   PETRUCHIO. Sir, understand you this of me, in sooth:
1 977     The youngest daughter, whom you hearken for,
1 978     Her father keeps from all access of suitors,
1 979     And will not promise her to any man
1 980     Until the elder sister first be wed.
1 981     The younger then is free, and not before.
1 982   TRANIO. If it be so, sir, that you are the man
1 983     Must stead us all, and me amongst the rest;
1 984     And if you break the ice, and do this feat,
1 985     Achieve the elder, set the younger free
1 986     For our access- whose hap shall be to have her 
1 987     Will not so graceless be to be ingrate.
1 988   HORTENSIO. Sir, you say well, and well you do conceive;
1 989     And since you do profess to be a suitor,
1 990     You must, as we do, gratify this gentleman,
1 991     To whom we all rest generally beholding.
1 992   TRANIO. Sir, I shall not be slack; in sign whereof,
1 993     Please ye we may contrive this afternoon,
1 994     And quaff carouses to our mistress' health;
1 995     And do as adversaries do in law-
1 996     Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends.
1 997   GRUMIO, BIONDELLO. O excellent motion! Fellows, let's be gone.
1 998   HORTENSIO. The motion's good indeed, and be it so.
1 999     Petruchio, I shall be your ben venuto.                Exeunt

1 1015 ACT II. SCENE I.
1 1016 Padua. BAPTISTA'S house
1 1017 
1 1018 Enter KATHERINA and BIANCA
1 1019 
1 1020   BIANCA. Good sister, wrong me not, nor wrong yourself,
1 1021     To make a bondmaid and a slave of me-
1 1022     That I disdain; but for these other gawds,
1 1023     Unbind my hands, I'll pull them off myself,
1 1024     Yea, all my raiment, to my petticoat;
1 1025     Or what you will command me will I do,
1 1026     So well I know my duty to my elders.
1 1027   KATHERINA. Of all thy suitors here I charge thee tell
1 1028     Whom thou lov'st best. See thou dissemble not.
1 1029   BIANCA. Believe me, sister, of all the men alive
1 1030     I never yet beheld that special face
1 1031     Which I could fancy more than any other.
1 1032   KATHERINA. Minion, thou liest. Is't not Hortensio?
1 1033   BIANCA. If you affect him, sister, here I swear
1 1034     I'll plead for you myself but you shall have him.
1 1035   KATHERINA. O then, belike, you fancy riches more:
1 1036     You will have Gremio to keep you fair. 
1 1037   BIANCA. Is it for him you do envy me so?
1 1038     Nay, then you jest; and now I well perceive
1 1039     You have but jested with me all this while.
1 1040     I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands.
1 1041   KATHERINA. [Strikes her]  If that be jest, then an the rest was
1 1042 so.
1 1043 
1 1044                             Enter BAPTISTA
1 1045 
1 1046   BAPTISTA. Why, how now, dame! Whence grows this insolence?
1 1047     Bianca, stand aside- poor girl! she weeps.
1 1048                                                 [He unbinds her]
1 1049     Go ply thy needle; meddle not with her.
1 1050     For shame, thou hilding of a devilish spirit,
1 1051     Why dost thou wrong her that did ne'er wrong thee?
1 1052     When did she cross thee with a bitter word?
1 1053   KATHERINA. Her silence flouts me, and I'll be reveng'd.
1 1054                                             [Flies after BIANCA]
1 1055   BAPTISTA. What, in my sight? Bianca, get thee in.
1 1056                                                      Exit BIANCA
1 1057   KATHERINA. What, will you not suffer me? Nay, now I see 
1 1058     She is your treasure, she must have a husband;
1 1059     I must dance bare-foot on her wedding-day,
1 1060     And for your love to her lead apes in hell.
1 1061     Talk not to me; I will go sit and weep,
1 1062     Till I can find occasion of revenge.          Exit KATHERINA
1 1063   BAPTISTA. Was ever gentleman thus griev'd as I?
1 1064     But who comes here?
1 1065 
1 1066         Enter GREMIO, with LUCENTIO in the habit of a mean man;
1 1067          PETRUCHIO, with HORTENSIO as a musician; and TRANIO,
1 1068     as LUCENTIO, with his boy, BIONDELLO, bearing a lute and
1 1069 books
1 1070 
1 1071   GREMIO. Good morrow, neighbour Baptista.
1 1072   BAPTISTA. Good morrow, neighbour Gremio.
1 1073     God save you, gentlemen!
1 1074   PETRUCHIO. And you, good sir! Pray, have you not a daughter
1 1075     Call'd Katherina, fair and virtuous?
1 1076   BAPTISTA. I have a daughter, sir, call'd Katherina.
1 1077   GREMIO. You are too blunt; go to it orderly.
1 1078   PETRUCHIO. You wrong me, Signior Gremio; give me leave. 
1 1079     I am a gentleman of Verona, sir,
1 1080     That, hearing of her beauty and her wit,
1 1081     Her affability and bashful modesty,
1 1082     Her wondrous qualities and mild behaviour,
1 1083     Am bold to show myself a forward guest
1 1084     Within your house, to make mine eye the witness
1 1085     Of that report which I so oft have heard.
1 1086     And, for an entrance to my entertainment,
1 1087     I do present you with a man of mine,
1 1088                                           [Presenting HORTENSIO]
1 1089     Cunning in music and the mathematics,
1 1090     To instruct her fully in those sciences,
1 1091     Whereof I know she is not ignorant.
1 1092     Accept of him, or else you do me wrong-
1 1093     His name is Licio, born in Mantua.
1 1094   BAPTISTA. Y'are welcome, sir, and he for your good sake;
1 1095     But for my daughter Katherine, this I know,
1 1096     She is not for your turn, the more my grief.
1 1097   PETRUCHIO. I see you do not mean to part with her;
1 1098     Or else you like not of my company. 
1 1099   BAPTISTA. Mistake me not; I speak but as I find.
1 1100     Whence are you, sir? What may I call your name?
1 1101   PETRUCHIO. Petruchio is my name, Antonio's son,
1 1102     A man well known throughout all Italy.
1 1103   BAPTISTA. I know him well; you are welcome for his sake.
1 1104   GREMIO. Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray,
1 1105     Let us that are poor petitioners speak too.
1 1106     Bacare! you are marvellous forward.
1 1107   PETRUCHIO. O, pardon me, Signior Gremio! I would fain be doing.
1 1108   GREMIO. I doubt it not, sir; but you will curse your wooing.
1 1109     Neighbour, this is a gift very grateful, I am sure of it. To
1 1110     express the like kindness, myself, that have been more kindly
1 1111     beholding to you than any, freely give unto you this young
1 1112     scholar  [Presenting LUCENTIO]  that hath been long studying
1 1113 at
1 1114     Rheims; as cunning in Greek, Latin, and other languages, as
1 1115 the
1 1116     other in music and mathematics. His name is Cambio. Pray
1 1117 accept
1 1118     his service.
1 1119   BAPTISTA. A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio. Welcome, good
1 1120 Cambio.
1 1121     [To TRANIO]  But, gentle sir, methinks you walk like a
1 1122 stranger.
1 1123     May I be so bold to know the cause of your coming? 
1 1124   TRANIO. Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own
1 1125     That, being a stranger in this city here,
1 1126     Do make myself a suitor to your daughter,
1 1127     Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous.
1 1128     Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me
1 1129     In the preferment of the eldest sister.
1 1130     This liberty is all that I request-
1 1131     That, upon knowledge of my parentage,
1 1132     I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo,
1 1133     And free access and favour as the rest.
1 1134     And toward the education of your daughters
1 1135     I here bestow a simple instrument,
1 1136     And this small packet of Greek and Latin books.
1 1137     If you accept them, then their worth is great.
1 1138   BAPTISTA. Lucentio is your name? Of whence, I pray?
1 1139   TRANIO. Of Pisa, sir; son to Vincentio.
1 1140   BAPTISTA. A mighty man of Pisa. By report
1 1141     I know him well. You are very welcome, sir.
1 1142     Take you the lute, and you the set of books;
1 1143     You shall go see your pupils presently. 
1 1144     Holla, within!
1 1145 
1 1146                          Enter a SERVANT
1 1147 
1 1148     Sirrah, lead these gentlemen
1 1149     To my daughters; and tell them both
1 1150     These are their tutors. Bid them use them well.
1 1151 
1 1152                 Exit SERVANT leading HORTENSIO carrying the lute
1 1153                                      and LUCENTIO with the books
1 1154 
1 1155     We will go walk a little in the orchard,
1 1156     And then to dinner. You are passing welcome,
1 1157     And so I pray you all to think yourselves.
1 1158   PETRUCHIO. Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste,
1 1159     And every day I cannot come to woo.
1 1160     You knew my father well, and in him me,
1 1161     Left solely heir to all his lands and goods,
1 1162     Which I have bettered rather than decreas'd.
1 1163     Then tell me, if I get your daughter's love, 
1 1164     What dowry shall I have with her to wife?
1 1165   BAPTISTA. After my death, the one half of my lands
1 1166     And, in possession, twenty thousand crowns.
1 1167   PETRUCHIO. And for that dowry, I'll assure her of
1 1168     Her widowhood, be it that she survive me,
1 1169     In all my lands and leases whatsoever.
1 1170     Let specialities be therefore drawn between us,
1 1171     That covenants may be kept on either hand.
1 1172   BAPTISTA. Ay, when the special thing is well obtain'd,
1 1173     That is, her love; for that is all in all.
1 1174   PETRUCHIO. Why, that is nothing; for I tell you, father,
1 1175     I am as peremptory as she proud-minded;
1 1176     And where two raging fires meet together,
1 1177     They do consume the thing that feeds their fury.
1 1178     Though little fire grows great with little wind,
1 1179     Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all.
1 1180     So I to her, and so she yields to me;
1 1181     For I am rough, and woo not like a babe.
1 1182   BAPTISTA. Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed
1 1183     But be thou arm'd for some unhappy words. 
1 1184   PETRUCHIO. Ay, to the proof, as mountains are for winds,
1 1185     That shake not though they blow perpetually.
1 1186 
1 1187              Re-enter HORTENSIO, with his head broke
1 1188 
1 1189   BAPTISTA. How now, my friend! Why dost thou look so pale?
1 1190   HORTENSIO. For fear, I promise you, if I look pale.
1 1191   BAPTISTA. What, will my daughter prove a good musician?
1 1192   HORTENSIO. I think she'll sooner prove a soldier:
1 1193     Iron may hold with her, but never lutes.
1 1194   BAPTISTA. Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?
1 1195   HORTENSIO. Why, no; for she hath broke the lute to me.
1 1196     I did but tell her she mistook her frets,
1 1197     And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering,
1 1198     When, with a most impatient devilish spirit,
1 1199     'Frets, call you these?' quoth she 'I'll fume with them.'
1 1200     And with that word she struck me on the head,
1 1201     And through the instrument my pate made way;
1 1202     And there I stood amazed for a while,
1 1203     As on a pillory, looking through the lute, 
1 1204     While she did call me rascal fiddler
1 1205     And twangling Jack, with twenty such vile terms,
1 1206     As she had studied to misuse me so.
1 1207   PETRUCHIO. Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench;
1 1208     I love her ten times more than e'er I did.
1 1209     O, how I long to have some chat with her!
1 1210   BAPTISTA. Well, go with me, and be not so discomfited;
1 1211     Proceed in practice with my younger daughter;
1 1212     She's apt to learn, and thankful for good turns.
1 1213     Signior Petruchio, will you go with us,
1 1214     Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?
1 1215   PETRUCHIO. I pray you do.             Exeunt all but PETRUCHIO
1 1216     I'll attend her here,
1 1217     And woo her with some spirit when she comes.
1 1218     Say that she rail; why, then I'll tell her plain
1 1219     She sings as sweetly as a nightingale.
1 1220     Say that she frown; I'll say she looks as clear
1 1221     As morning roses newly wash'd with dew.
1 1222     Say she be mute, and will not speak a word;
1 1223     Then I'll commend her volubility, 
1 1224     And say she uttereth piercing eloquence.
1 1225     If she do bid me pack, I'll give her thanks,
1 1226     As though she bid me stay by her a week;
1 1227     If she deny to wed, I'll crave the day
1 1228     When I shall ask the banns, and when be married.
1 1229     But here she comes; and now, Petruchio, speak.
1 1230 
1 1231                         Enter KATHERINA
1 1232 
1 1233     Good morrow, Kate- for that's your name, I hear.
1 1234   KATHERINA. Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing:
1 1235     They call me Katherine that do talk of me.
1 1236   PETRUCHIO. You lie, in faith, for you are call'd plain Kate,
1 1237     And bonny Kate, and sometimes Kate the curst;
1 1238     But, Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom,
1 1239     Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate,
1 1240     For dainties are all Kates, and therefore, Kate,
1 1241     Take this of me, Kate of my consolation-
1 1242     Hearing thy mildness prais'd in every town,
1 1243     Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded, 
1 1244     Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs,
1 1245     Myself am mov'd to woo thee for my wife.
1 1246   KATHERINA. Mov'd! in good time! Let him that mov'd you hither
1 1247     Remove you hence. I knew you at the first
1 1248     You were a moveable.
1 1249   PETRUCHIO. Why, what's a moveable?
1 1250   KATHERINA. A join'd-stool.
1 1251   PETRUCHIO. Thou hast hit it. Come, sit on me.
1 1252   KATHERINA. Asses are made to bear, and so are you.
1 1253   PETRUCHIO. Women are made to bear, and so are you.
1 1254   KATHERINA. No such jade as you, if me you mean.
1 1255   PETRUCHIO. Alas, good Kate, I will not burden thee!
1 1256     For, knowing thee to be but young and light-
1 1257   KATHERINA. Too light for such a swain as you to catch;
1 1258     And yet as heavy as my weight should be.
1 1259   PETRUCHIO. Should be! should- buzz!
1 1260   KATHERINA. Well ta'en, and like a buzzard.
1 1261   PETRUCHIO. O, slow-wing'd turtle, shall a buzzard take thee?
1 1262   KATHERINA. Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.
1 1263   PETRUCHIO. Come, come, you wasp; i' faith, you are too angry. 
1 1264   KATHERINA. If I be waspish, best beware my sting.
1 1265   PETRUCHIO. My remedy is then to pluck it out.
1 1266   KATHERINA. Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies.
1 1267   PETRUCHIO. Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting?
1 1268     In his tail.
1 1269   KATHERINA. In his tongue.
1 1270   PETRUCHIO. Whose tongue?
1 1271   KATHERINA. Yours, if you talk of tales; and so farewell.
1 1272   PETRUCHIO. What, with my tongue in your tail? Nay, come again,
1 1273     Good Kate; I am a gentleman.
1 1274   KATHERINA. That I'll try.                    [She strikes him]
1 1275   PETRUCHIO. I swear I'll cuff you, if you strike again.
1 1276   KATHERINA. So may you lose your arms.
1 1277     If you strike me, you are no gentleman;
1 1278     And if no gentleman, why then no arms.
1 1279   PETRUCHIO. A herald, Kate? O, put me in thy books!
1 1280   KATHERINA. What is your crest- a coxcomb?
1 1281   PETRUCHIO. A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.
1 1282   KATHERINA. No cock of mine: you crow too like a craven.
1 1283   PETRUCHIO. Nay, come, Kate, come; you must not look so sour. 
1 1284   KATHERINA. It is my fashion, when I see a crab.
1 1285   PETRUCHIO. Why, here's no crab; and therefore look not sour.
1 1286   KATHERINA. There is, there is.
1 1287   PETRUCHIO. Then show it me.
1 1288   KATHERINA. Had I a glass I would.
1 1289   PETRUCHIO. What, you mean my face?
1 1290   KATHERINA. Well aim'd of such a young one.
1 1291   PETRUCHIO. Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you.
1 1292   KATHERINA. Yet you are wither'd.
1 1293   PETRUCHIO. 'Tis with cares.
1 1294   KATHERINA. I care not.
1 1295   PETRUCHIO. Nay, hear you, Kate- in sooth, you scape not so.
1 1296   KATHERINA. I chafe you, if I tarry; let me go.
1 1297   PETRUCHIO. No, not a whit; I find you passing gentle.
1 1298     'Twas told me you were rough, and coy, and sullen,
1 1299     And now I find report a very liar;
1 1300     For thou art pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,
1 1301     But slow in speech, yet sweet as springtime flowers.
1 1302     Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance,
1 1303     Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will, 
1 1304     Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk;
1 1305     But thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers;
1 1306     With gentle conference, soft and affable.
1 1307     Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?
1 1308     O sland'rous world! Kate like the hazel-twig
1 1309     Is straight and slender, and as brown in hue
1 1310     As hazel-nuts, and sweeter than the kernels.
1 1311     O, let me see thee walk. Thou dost not halt.
1 1312   KATHERINA. Go, fool, and whom thou keep'st command.
1 1313   PETRUCHIO. Did ever Dian so become a grove
1 1314     As Kate this chamber with her princely gait?
1 1315     O, be thou Dian, and let her be Kate;
1 1316     And then let Kate be chaste, and Dian sportful!
1 1317   KATHERINA. Where did you study all this goodly speech?
1 1318   PETRUCHIO. It is extempore, from my mother wit.
1 1319   KATHERINA. A witty mother! witless else her son.
1 1320   PETRUCHIO. Am I not wise?
1 1321   KATHERINA. Yes, keep you warm.
1 1322   PETRUCHIO. Marry, so I mean, sweet Katherine, in thy bed.
1 1323     And therefore, setting all this chat aside, 
1 1324     Thus in plain terms: your father hath consented
1 1325     That you shall be my wife your dowry greed on;
1 1326     And will you, nill you, I will marry you.
1 1327     Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn;
1 1328     For, by this light, whereby I see thy beauty,
1 1329     Thy beauty that doth make me like thee well,
1 1330     Thou must be married to no man but me;
1 1331     For I am he am born to tame you, Kate,
1 1332     And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate
1 1333     Conformable as other household Kates.
1 1334 
1 1335                Re-enter BAPTISTA, GREMIO, and TRANIO
1 1336 
1 1337     Here comes your father. Never make denial;
1 1338     I must and will have Katherine to my wife.
1 1339   BAPTISTA. Now, Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my
1 1340 daughter?
1 1341   PETRUCHIO. How but well, sir? how but well?
1 1342     It were impossible I should speed amiss.
1 1343   BAPTISTA. Why, how now, daughter Katherine, in your dumps?
1 1344   KATHERINA. Call you me daughter? Now I promise you 
1 1345     You have show'd a tender fatherly regard
1 1346     To wish me wed to one half lunatic,
1 1347     A mad-cap ruffian and a swearing Jack,
1 1348     That thinks with oaths to face the matter out.
1 1349   PETRUCHIO. Father, 'tis thus: yourself and all the world
1 1350     That talk'd of her have talk'd amiss of her.
1 1351     If she be curst, it is for policy,
1 1352     For,she's not froward, but modest as the dove;
1 1353     She is not hot, but temperate as the morn;
1 1354     For patience she will prove a second Grissel,
1 1355     And Roman Lucrece for her chastity.
1 1356     And, to conclude, we have 'greed so well together
1 1357     That upon Sunday is the wedding-day.
1 1358   KATHERINA. I'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first.
1 1359   GREMIO. Hark, Petruchio; she says she'll see thee hang'd first.
1 1360   TRANIO. Is this your speeding? Nay, then good-night our part!
1 1361   PETRUCHIO. Be patient, gentlemen. I choose her for myself;
1 1362     If she and I be pleas'd, what's that to you?
1 1363     'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain, being alone,
1 1364     That she shall still be curst in company. 
1 1365     I tell you 'tis incredible to believe.
1 1366     How much she loves me- O, the kindest Kate!
1 1367     She hung about my neck, and kiss on kiss
1 1368     She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath,
1 1369     That in a twink she won me to her love.
1 1370     O, you are novices! 'Tis a world to see,
1 1371     How tame, when men and women are alone,
1 1372     A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.
1 1373     Give me thy hand, Kate; I will unto Venice,
1 1374     To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding-day.
1 1375     Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests;
1 1376     I will be sure my Katherine shall be fine.
1 1377   BAPTISTA. I know not what to say; but give me your hands.
1 1378     God send you joy, Petruchio! 'Tis a match.
1 1379   GREMIO, TRANIO. Amen, say we; we will be witnesses.
1 1380   PETRUCHIO. Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu.
1 1381     I will to Venice; Sunday comes apace;
1 1382     We will have rings and things, and fine array;
1 1383     And kiss me, Kate; we will be married a Sunday.
1 1384                         Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHERINA severally 
1 1385   GREMIO. Was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly?
1 1386   BAPTISTA. Faith, gentlemen, now I play a merchant's part,
1 1387     And venture madly on a desperate mart.
1 1388   TRANIO. 'Twas a commodity lay fretting by you;
1 1389     'Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas.
1 1390   BAPTISTA. The gain I seek is quiet in the match.
1 1391   GREMIO. No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch.
1 1392     But now, Baptista, to your younger daughter:
1 1393     Now is the day we long have looked for;
1 1394     I am your neighbour, and was suitor first.
1 1395   TRANIO. And I am one that love Bianca more
1 1396     Than words can witness or your thoughts can guess.
1 1397   GREMIO. Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I.
1 1398   TRANIO. Greybeard, thy love doth freeze.
1 1399   GREMIO. But thine doth fry.
1 1400     Skipper, stand back; 'tis age that nourisheth.
1 1401   TRANIO. But youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth.
1 1402   BAPTISTA. Content you, gentlemen; I will compound this strife.
1 1403     'Tis deeds must win the prize, and he of both
1 1404     That can assure my daughter greatest dower 
1 1405     Shall have my Bianca's love.
1 1406     Say, Signior Gremio, what can you assure her?
1 1407   GREMIO. First, as you know, my house within the city
1 1408     Is richly furnished with plate and gold,
1 1409     Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands;
1 1410     My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry;
1 1411     In ivory coffers I have stuff'd my crowns;
1 1412     In cypress chests my arras counterpoints,
1 1413     Costly apparel, tents, and canopies,
1 1414     Fine linen, Turkey cushions boss'd with pearl,
1 1415     Valance of Venice gold in needle-work;
1 1416     Pewter and brass, and all things that belongs
1 1417     To house or housekeeping. Then at my farm
1 1418     I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail,
1 1419     Six score fat oxen standing in my stalls,
1 1420     And all things answerable to this portion.
1 1421     Myself am struck in years, I must confess;
1 1422     And if I die to-morrow this is hers,
1 1423     If whilst I live she will be only mine.
1 1424   TRANIO. That 'only' came well in. Sir, list to me: 
1 1425     I am my father's heir and only son;
1 1426     If I may have your daughter to my wife,
1 1427     I'll leave her houses three or four as good
1 1428     Within rich Pisa's walls as any one
1 1429     Old Signior Gremio has in Padua;
1 1430     Besides two thousand ducats by the year
1 1431     Of fruitful land, all which shall be her jointure.
1 1432     What, have I pinch'd you, Signior Gremio?
1 1433   GREMIO. Two thousand ducats by the year of land!
1 1434     [Aside]  My land amounts not to so much in all.-
1 1435     That she shall have, besides an argosy
1 1436     That now is lying in Marseilles road.
1 1437     What, have I chok'd you with an argosy?
1 1438   TRANIO. Gremio, 'tis known my father hath no less
1 1439     Than three great argosies, besides two galliasses,
1 1440     And twelve tight galleys. These I will assure her,
1 1441     And twice as much whate'er thou off'rest next.
1 1442   GREMIO. Nay, I have off'red all; I have no more;
1 1443     And she can have no more than all I have;
1 1444     If you like me, she shall have me and mine. 
1 1445   TRANIO. Why, then the maid is mine from all the world
1 1446     By your firm promise; Gremio is out-vied.
1 1447   BAPTISTA. I must confess your offer is the best;
1 1448     And let your father make her the assurance,
1 1449     She is your own. Else, you must pardon me;
1 1450     If you should die before him, where's her dower?
1 1451   TRANIO. That's but a cavil; he is old, I young.
1 1452   GREMIO. And may not young men die as well as old?
1 1453   BAPTISTA. Well, gentlemen,
1 1454     I am thus resolv'd: on Sunday next you know
1 1455     My daughter Katherine is to be married;
1 1456     Now, on the Sunday following shall Bianca
1 1457     Be bride to you, if you make this assurance;
1 1458     If not, to Signior Gremio.
1 1459     And so I take my leave, and thank you both.
1 1460   GREMIO. Adieu, good neighbour.                   Exit BAPTISTA
1 1461     Now, I fear thee not.
1 1462     Sirrah young gamester, your father were a fool
1 1463     To give thee all, and in his waning age
1 1464     Set foot under thy table. Tut, a toy! 
1 1465     An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy.              Exit
1 1466   TRANIO. A vengeance on your crafty withered hide!
1 1467     Yet I have fac'd it with a card of ten.
1 1468     'Tis in my head to do my master good:
1 1469     I see no reason but suppos'd Lucentio
1 1470     Must get a father, call'd suppos'd Vincentio;
1 1471     And that's a wonder- fathers commonly
1 1472     Do get their children; but in this case of wooing
1 1473     A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.
1 1474  Exit

1 1490 ACT III. SCENE I.
1 1491 Padua. BAPTISTA'S house
1 1492 
1 1493 Enter LUCENTIO as CAMBIO, HORTENSIO as LICIO, and BIANCA
1 1494 
1 1495   LUCENTIO. Fiddler, forbear; you grow too forward, sir.
1 1496     Have you so soon forgot the entertainment
1 1497     Her sister Katherine welcome'd you withal?
1 1498   HORTENSIO. But, wrangling pedant, this is
1 1499     The patroness of heavenly harmony.
1 1500     Then give me leave to have prerogative;
1 1501     And when in music we have spent an hour,
1 1502     Your lecture shall have leisure for as much.
1 1503   LUCENTIO. Preposterous ass, that never read so far
1 1504     To know the cause why music was ordain'd!
1 1505     Was it not to refresh the mind of man
1 1506     After his studies or his usual pain?
1 1507     Then give me leave to read philosophy,
1 1508     And while I pause serve in your harmony.
1 1509   HORTENSIO. Sirrah, I will not bear these braves of thine.
1 1510   BIANCA. Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong
1 1511     To strive for that which resteth in my choice. 
1 1512     I arn no breeching scholar in the schools,
1 1513     I'll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times,
1 1514     But learn my lessons as I please myself.
1 1515     And to cut off all strife: here sit we down;
1 1516     Take you your instrument, play you the whiles!
1 1517     His lecture will be done ere you have tun'd.
1 1518   HORTENSIO. You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune?
1 1519   LUCENTIO. That will be never- tune your instrument.
1 1520   BIANCA. Where left we last?
1 1521   LUCENTIO. Here, madam:
1 1522     'Hic ibat Simois, hic est Sigeia tellus,
1 1523     Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis.'
1 1524   BIANCA. Construe them.
1 1525   LUCENTIO. 'Hic ibat' as I told you before- 'Simois' I am
1 1526 Lucentio-
1 1527     'hic est' son unto Vincentio of Pisa- 'Sigeia tellus'
1 1528 disguised
1 1529     thus to get your love- 'Hic steterat' and that Lucentio that
1 1530     comes a-wooing- 'Priami' is my man Tranio- 'regia' bearing my
1 1531     port- 'celsa senis' that we might beguile the old pantaloon.
1 1532   HORTENSIO. Madam, my instrument's in tune.
1 1533   BIANCA. Let's hear. O fie! the treble jars. 
1 1534   LUCENTIO. Spit in the hole, man, and tune again.
1 1535   BIANCA. Now let me see if I can construe it: 'Hic ibat Simois'
1 1536 I
1 1537     know you not- 'hic est Sigeia tellus' I trust you not- 'Hic
1 1538     steterat Priami' take heed he hear us not- 'regia' presume
1 1539 not-
1 1540    'celsa senis' despair not.
1 1541   HORTENSIO. Madam, 'tis now in tune.
1 1542   LUCENTIO. All but the bass.
1 1543   HORTENSIO. The bass is right; 'tis the base knave that jars.
1 1544     [Aside]  How fiery and forward our pedant is!
1 1545     Now, for my life, the knave doth court my love.
1 1546     Pedascule, I'll watch you better yet.
1 1547   BIANCA. In time I may believe, yet I mistrust.
1 1548   LUCENTIO. Mistrust it not- for sure, AEacides
1 1549     Was Ajax, call'd so from his grandfather.
1 1550   BIANCA. I must believe my master; else, I promise you,
1 1551     I should be arguing still upon that doubt;
1 1552     But let it rest. Now, Licio, to you.
1 1553     Good master, take it not unkindly, pray,
1 1554     That I have been thus pleasant with you both.
1 1555   HORTENSIO.  [To LUCENTIO]  You may go walk and give me leave 
1 1556       awhile;
1 1557     My lessons make no music in three Parts.
1 1558   LUCENTIO. Are you so formal, sir? Well, I must wait,
1 1559     [Aside]  And watch withal; for, but I be deceiv'd,
1 1560     Our fine musician groweth amorous.
1 1561   HORTENSIO. Madam, before you touch the instrument
1 1562     To learn the order of my fingering,
1 1563     I must begin with rudiments of art,
1 1564     To teach you gamut in a briefer sort,
1 1565     More pleasant, pithy, and effectual,
1 1566     Than hath been taught by any of my trade;
1 1567     And there it is in writing fairly drawn.
1 1568   BIANCA. Why, I am past my gamut long ago.
1 1569   HORTENSIO. Yet read the gamut of Hortensio.
1 1570   BIANCA.  [Reads]
1 1571          '"Gamut" I am, the ground of all accord-
1 1572          "A re" to plead Hortensio's passion-
1 1573          "B mi" Bianca, take him for thy lord-
1 1574          "C fa ut" that loves with all affection-
1 1575          "D sol re" one clef, two notes have I- 
1 1576          "E la mi" show pity or I die.'
1 1577     Call you this gamut? Tut, I like it not!
1 1578     Old fashions please me best; I am not so nice
1 1579     To change true rules for odd inventions.
1 1580 
1 1581                        Enter a SERVANT
1 1582 
1 1583   SERVANT. Mistress, your father prays you leave your books
1 1584     And help to dress your sister's chamber up.
1 1585     You know to-morrow is the wedding-day.
1 1586   BIANCA. Farewell, sweet masters, both; I must be gone.
1 1587                                        Exeunt BIANCA and SERVANT
1 1588   LUCENTIO. Faith, mistress, then I have no cause to stay.
1 1589  Exit
1 1590   HORTENSIO. But I have cause to pry into this pedant;
1 1591     Methinks he looks as though he were in love.
1 1592     Yet if thy thoughts, Bianca, be so humble
1 1593     To cast thy wand'ring eyes on every stale-
1 1594     Seize thee that list. If once I find thee ranging,
1 1595   HORTENSIO will be quit with thee by changing.             Exit
1 1596 
1 1597 
1 1598 
1 1599 
1 1600 SCENE II.
1 1601 Padua. Before BAPTISTA'S house
1 1602 
1 1603 Enter BAPTISTA, GREMIO, TRANIO as LUCENTIO, KATHERINA, BIANCA,
1 1604 LUCENTIO as CAMBIO, and ATTENDANTS
1 1605 
1 1606   BAPTISTA.  [To TRANIO]  Signior Lucentio, this is the 'pointed
1 1607 day
1 1608     That Katherine and Petruchio should be married,
1 1609     And yet we hear not of our son-in-law.
1 1610     What will be said? What mockery will it be
1 1611     To want the bridegroom when the priest attends
1 1612     To speak the ceremonial rites of marriage!
1 1613     What says Lucentio to this shame of ours?
1 1614   KATHERINA. No shame but mine; I must, forsooth, be forc'd
1 1615     To give my hand, oppos'd against my heart,
1 1616     Unto a mad-brain rudesby, full of spleen,
1 1617     Who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure.
1 1618     I told you, I, he was a frantic fool,
1 1619     Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behaviour;
1 1620     And, to be noted for a merry man,
1 1621     He'll woo a thousand, 'point the day of marriage,
1 1622     Make friends invited, and proclaim the banns; 
1 1623     Yet never means to wed where he hath woo'd.
1 1624     Now must the world point at poor Katherine,
1 1625     And say 'Lo, there is mad Petruchio's wife,
1 1626     If it would please him come and marry her!'
1 1627   TRANIO. Patience, good Katherine, and Baptista too.
1 1628     Upon my life, Petruchio means but well,
1 1629     Whatever fortune stays him from his word.
1 1630     Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise;
1 1631     Though he be merry, yet withal he's honest.
1 1632   KATHERINA. Would Katherine had never seen him though!
1 1633                     Exit, weeping, followed by BIANCA and others
1 1634   BAPTISTA. Go, girl, I cannot blame thee now to weep,
1 1635     For such an injury would vex a very saint;
1 1636     Much more a shrew of thy impatient humour.
1 1637 
1 1638                            Enter BIONDELLO
1 1639 
1 1640     Master, master! News, and such old news as you never heard
1 1641 of!
1 1642   BAPTISTA. Is it new and old too? How may that be?
1 1643   BIONDELLO. Why, is it not news to hear of Petruchio's coming? 
1 1644   BAPTISTA. Is he come?
1 1645   BIONDELLO. Why, no, sir.
1 1646   BAPTISTA. What then?
1 1647   BIONDELLO. He is coming.
1 1648   BAPTISTA. When will he be here?
1 1649   BIONDELLO. When he stands where I am and sees you there.
1 1650   TRANIO. But, say, what to thine old news?
1 1651   BIONDELLO. Why, Petruchio is coming- in a new hat and an old
1 1652     jerkin; a pair of old breeches thrice turn'd; a pair of boots
1 1653     that have been candle-cases, one buckled, another lac'd; an
1 1654 old
1 1655     rusty sword ta'en out of the town armoury, with a broken
1 1656 hilt,
1 1657     and chapeless; with two broken points; his horse hipp'd, with
1 1658 an
1 1659     old motley saddle and stirrups of no kindred; besides,
1 1660 possess'd
1 1661     with the glanders and like to mose in the chine, troubled
1 1662 with
1 1663     the lampass, infected with the fashions, full of windgalls,
1 1664 sped
1 1665     with spavins, rayed with the yellows, past cure of the fives,
1 1666     stark spoil'd with the staggers, begnawn with the bots,
1 1667 sway'd in
1 1668     the back and shoulder-shotten, near-legg'd before, and with a
1 1669     half-cheek'd bit, and a head-stall of sheep's leather which,
1 1670     being restrained to keep him from stumbling, hath been often 
1 1671     burst, and now repaired with knots; one girth six times
1 1672 piec'd,
1 1673     and a woman's crupper of velure, which hath two letters for
1 1674 her
1 1675     name fairly set down in studs, and here and there piec'd with
1 1676     pack-thread.
1 1677   BAPTISTA. Who comes with him?
1 1678   BIONDELLO. O, sir, his lackey, for all the world caparison'd
1 1679 like
1 1680     the horse- with a linen stock on one leg and a kersey
1 1681 boot-hose
1 1682     on the other, gart'red with a red and blue list; an old hat,
1 1683 and
1 1684     the humour of forty fancies prick'd in't for a feather; a
1 1685     monster, a very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian
1 1686     footboy or a gentleman's lackey.
1 1687   TRANIO. 'Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion;
1 1688     Yet oftentimes lie goes but mean-apparell'd.
1 1689   BAPTISTA. I am glad he's come, howsoe'er he comes.
1 1690   BIONDELLO. Why, sir, he comes not.
1 1691   BAPTISTA. Didst thou not say he comes?
1 1692   BIONDELLO. Who? that Petruchio came?
1 1693   BAPTISTA. Ay, that Petruchio came.
1 1694   BIONDELLO. No, sir; I say his horse comes with him on his back.
1 1695   BAPTISTA. Why, that's all one. 
1 1696   BIONDELLO. Nay, by Saint Jamy,
1 1697              I hold you a penny,
1 1698              A horse and a man
1 1699              Is more than one,
1 1700              And yet not many.
1 1701 
1 1702                   Enter PETRUCHIO and GRUMIO
1 1703 
1 1704   PETRUCHIO. Come, where be these gallants? Who's at home?
1 1705   BAPTISTA. You are welcome, sir.
1 1706   PETRUCHIO. And yet I come not well.
1 1707   BAPTISTA. And yet you halt not.
1 1708   TRANIO. Not so well apparell'd
1 1709     As I wish you were.
1 1710   PETRUCHIO. Were it better, I should rush in thus.
1 1711     But where is Kate? Where is my lovely bride?
1 1712     How does my father? Gentles, methinks you frown;
1 1713     And wherefore gaze this goodly company
1 1714     As if they saw some wondrous monument,
1 1715     Some comet or unusual prodigy? 
1 1716   BAPTISTA. Why, sir, you know this is your wedding-day.
1 1717     First were we sad, fearing you would not come;
1 1718     Now sadder, that you come so unprovided.
1 1719     Fie, doff this habit, shame to your estate,
1 1720     An eye-sore to our solemn festival!
1 1721   TRANIO. And tell us what occasion of import
1 1722     Hath all so long detain'd you from your wife,
1 1723     And sent you hither so unlike yourself?
1 1724   PETRUCHIO. Tedious it were to tell, and harsh to hear;
1 1725     Sufficeth I am come to keep my word,
1 1726     Though in some part enforced to digress,
1 1727     Which at more leisure I will so excuse
1 1728     As you shall well be satisfied withal.
1 1729     But where is Kate? I stay too long from her;
1 1730     The morning wears, 'tis time we were at church.
1 1731   TRANIO. See not your bride in these unreverent robes;
1 1732     Go to my chamber, put on clothes of mine.
1 1733   PETRUCHIO. Not I, believe me; thus I'll visit her.
1 1734   BAPTISTA. But thus, I trust, you will not marry her.
1 1735   PETRUCHIO. Good sooth, even thus; therefore ha' done with
1 1736 words; 
1 1737     To me she's married, not unto my clothes.
1 1738     Could I repair what she will wear in me
1 1739     As I can change these poor accoutrements,
1 1740     'Twere well for Kate and better for myself.
1 1741     But what a fool am I to chat with you,
1 1742     When I should bid good-morrow to my bride
1 1743     And seal the title with a lovely kiss!
1 1744                                   Exeunt PETRUCHIO and GRUMIO
1 1745   TRANIO. He hath some meaning in his mad attire.
1 1746     We will persuade him, be it possible,
1 1747     To put on better ere he go to church.
1 1748   BAPTISTA. I'll after him and see the event of this.
1 1749               Exeunt BAPTISTA, GREMIO, BIONDELLO, and ATTENDENTS
1 1750   TRANIO. But to her love concerneth us to ad
1 1751     Her father's liking; which to bring to pass,
1 1752     As I before imparted to your worship,
1 1753     I am to get a man- whate'er he be
1 1754     It skills not much; we'll fit him to our turn-
1 1755     And he shall be Vincentio of Pisa,
1 1756     And make assurance here in Padua 
1 1757     Of greater sums than I have promised.
1 1758     So shall you quietly enjoy your hope
1 1759     And marry sweet Bianca with consent.
1 1760   LUCENTIO. Were it not that my fellow schoolmaster
1 1761     Doth watch Bianca's steps so narrowly,
1 1762     'Twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage;
1 1763     Which once perform'd, let all the world say no,
1 1764     I'll keep mine own despite of all the world.
1 1765   TRANIO. That by degrees we mean to look into
1 1766     And watch our vantage in this business;
1 1767     We'll over-reach the greybeard, Gremio,
1 1768     The narrow-prying father, Minola,
1 1769     The quaint musician, amorous Licio-
1 1770     All for my master's sake, Lucentio.
1 1771 
1 1772                            Re-enter GREMIO
1 1773 
1 1774     Signior Gremio, came you from the church?
1 1775   GREMIO. As willingly as e'er I came from school.
1 1776   TRANIO. And is the bride and bridegroom coming home? 
1 1777   GREMIO. A bridegroom, say you? 'Tis a groom indeed,
1 1778     A grumbling groom, and that the girl shall find.
1 1779   TRANIO. Curster than she? Why, 'tis impossible.
1 1780   GREMIO. Why, he's a devil, a devil, a very fiend.
1 1781   TRANIO. Why, she's a devil, a devil, the devil's dam.
1 1782   GREMIO. Tut, she's a lamb, a dove, a fool, to him!
1 1783     I'll tell you, Sir Lucentio: when the priest
1 1784     Should ask if Katherine should be his wife,
1 1785     'Ay, by gogs-wouns' quoth he, and swore so loud
1 1786     That, all amaz'd, the priest let fall the book;
1 1787     And as he stoop'd again to take it up,
1 1788     This mad-brain'd bridegroom took him such a cuff
1 1789     That down fell priest and book, and book and priest.
1 1790     'Now take them up,' quoth he 'if any list.'
1 1791   TRANIO. What said the wench, when he rose again?
1 1792   GREMIO. Trembled and shook, for why he stamp'd and swore
1 1793     As if the vicar meant to cozen him.
1 1794     But after many ceremonies done
1 1795     He calls for wine: 'A health!' quoth he, as if
1 1796     He had been abroad, carousing to his mates 
1 1797     After a storm; quaff'd off the muscadel,
1 1798     And threw the sops all in the sexton's face,
1 1799     Having no other reason
1 1800     But that his beard grew thin and hungerly
1 1801     And seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking.
1 1802     This done, he took the bride about the neck,
1 1803     And kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack
1 1804     That at the parting all the church did echo.
1 1805     And I, seeing this, came thence for very shame;
1 1806     And after me, I know, the rout is coming.
1 1807     Such a mad marriage never was before.
1 1808     Hark, hark! I hear the minstrels play.         [Music plays]
1 1809 
1 1810        Enter PETRUCHIO, KATHERINA, BIANCA, BAPTISTA, HORTENSIO,
1 1811                          GRUMIO, and train
1 1812 
1 1813   PETRUCHIO. Gentlemen and friends, I thank you for your pains.
1 1814     I know you think to dine with me to-day,
1 1815     And have prepar'd great store of wedding cheer
1 1816     But so it is- my haste doth call me hence, 
1 1817     And therefore here I mean to take my leave.
1 1818   BAPTISTA. Is't possible you will away to-night?
1 1819   PETRUCHIO. I must away to-day before night come.
1 1820     Make it no wonder; if you knew my business,
1 1821     You would entreat me rather go than stay.
1 1822     And, honest company, I thank you all
1 1823     That have beheld me give away myself
1 1824     To this most patient, sweet, and virtuous wife.
1 1825     Dine with my father, drink a health to me.
1 1826     For I must hence; and farewell to you all.
1 1827   TRANIO. Let us entreat you stay till after dinner.
1 1828   PETRUCHIO. It may not be.
1 1829   GREMIO. Let me entreat you.
1 1830   PETRUCHIO. It cannot be.
1 1831   KATHERINA. Let me entreat you.
1 1832   PETRUCHIO. I am content.
1 1833   KATHERINA. Are you content to stay?
1 1834   PETRUCHIO. I am content you shall entreat me stay;
1 1835     But yet not stay, entreat me how you can.
1 1836   KATHERINA. Now, if you love me, stay. 
1 1837   PETRUCHIO. Grumio, my horse.
1 1838   GRUMIO. Ay, sir, they be ready; the oats have eaten the horses.
1 1839   KATHERINA. Nay, then,
1 1840     Do what thou canst, I will not go to-day;
1 1841     No, nor to-morrow, not till I please myself.
1 1842     The door is open, sir; there lies your way;
1 1843     You may be jogging whiles your boots are green;
1 1844     For me, I'll not be gone till I please myself.
1 1845     'Tis like you'll prove a jolly surly groom
1 1846     That take it on you at the first so roundly.
1 1847   PETRUCHIO. O Kate, content thee; prithee be not angry.
1 1848   KATHERINA. I will be angry; what hast thou to do?
1 1849     Father, be quiet; he shall stay my leisure.
1 1850   GREMIO. Ay, marry, sir, now it begins to work.
1 1851   KATHERINA. Gentlemen, forward to the bridal dinner.
1 1852     I see a woman may be made a fool
1 1853     If she had not a spirit to resist.
1 1854   PETRUCHIO. They shall go forward, Kate, at thy command.
1 1855     Obey the bride, you that attend on her;
1 1856     Go to the feast, revel and domineer, 
1 1857     Carouse full measure to her maidenhead;
1 1858     Be mad and merry, or go hang yourselves.
1 1859     But for my bonny Kate, she must with me.
1 1860     Nay, look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret;
1 1861     I will be master of what is mine own-
1 1862     She is my goods, my chattels, she is my house,
1 1863     My household stuff, my field, my barn,
1 1864     My horse, my ox, my ass, my any thing,
1 1865     And here she stands; touch her whoever dare;
1 1866     I'll bring mine action on the proudest he
1 1867     That stops my way in Padua. Grumio,
1 1868     Draw forth thy weapon; we are beset with thieves;
1 1869     Rescue thy mistress, if thou be a man.
1 1870     Fear not, sweet wench; they shall not touch thee, Kate;
1 1871     I'll buckler thee against a million.
1 1872                          Exeunt PETRUCHIO, KATHERINA, and GRUMIO
1 1873   BAPTISTA. Nay, let them go, a couple of quiet ones.
1 1874   GREMIO. Went they not quickly, I should die with laughing.
1 1875   TRANIO. Of all mad matches, never was the like.
1 1876   LUCENTIO. Mistress, what's your opinion of your sister? 
1 1877   BIANCA. That, being mad herself, she's madly mated.
1 1878   GREMIO. I warrant him, Petruchio is Kated.
1 1879   BAPTISTA. Neighbours and friends, though bride and bridegroom
1 1880 wants
1 1881     For to supply the places at the table,
1 1882     You know there wants no junkets at the feast.
1 1883     Lucentio, you shall supply the bridegroom's place;
1 1884     And let Bianca take her sister's room.
1 1885   TRANIO. Shall sweet Bianca practise how to bride it?
1 1886   BAPTISTA. She shall, Lucentio. Come, gentlemen, let's go.
1 1887                                                           Exeunt

1 1903 ACT IV. SCENE I.
1 1904 PETRUCHIO'S country house
1 1905 
1 1906 Enter GRUMIO
1 1907 
1 1908   GRUMIO. Fie, fie on all tired jades, on all mad masters, and
1 1909 all
1 1910     foul ways! Was ever man so beaten? Was ever man so ray'd? Was
1 1911     ever man so weary? I am sent before to make a fire, and they
1 1912 are
1 1913     coming after to warm them. Now were not I a little pot and
1 1914 soon
1 1915     hot, my very lips might freeze to my teeth, my tongue to the
1 1916 roof
1 1917     of my mouth, my heart in my belly, ere I should come by a
1 1918 fire to
1 1919     thaw me. But I with blowing the fire shall warm myself; for,
1 1920     considering the weather, a taller man than I will take cold.
1 1921     Holla, ho! Curtis!
1 1922 
1 1923                             Enter CURTIS
1 1924 
1 1925   CURTIS. Who is that calls so coldly?
1 1926   GRUMIO. A piece of ice. If thou doubt it, thou mayst slide from
1 1927 my
1 1928     shoulder to my heel with no greater a run but my head and my
1 1929     neck. A fire, good Curtis.
1 1930   CURTIS. Is my master and his wife coming, Grumio? 
1 1931   GRUMIO. O, ay, Curtis, ay; and therefore fire, fire; cast on no
1 1932     water.
1 1933   CURTIS. Is she so hot a shrew as she's reported?
1 1934   GRUMIO. She was, good Curtis, before this frost; but thou
1 1935 know'st
1 1936     winter tames man, woman, and beast; for it hath tam'd my old
1 1937     master, and my new mistress, and myself, fellow Curtis.
1 1938   CURTIS. Away, you three-inch fool! I am no beast.
1 1939   GRUMIO. Am I but three inches? Why, thy horn is a foot, and so
1 1940 long
1 1941     am I at the least. But wilt thou make a fire, or shall I
1 1942 complain
1 1943     on thee to our mistress, whose hand- she being now at hand-
1 1944 thou
1 1945     shalt soon feel, to thy cold comfort, for being slow in thy
1 1946 hot
1 1947     office?
1 1948   CURTIS. I prithee, good Grumio, tell me how goes the world?
1 1949   GRUMIO. A cold world, Curtis, in every office but thine; and
1 1950     therefore fire. Do thy duty, and have thy duty, for my master
1 1951 and
1 1952     mistress are almost frozen to death.
1 1953   CURTIS. There's fire ready; and therefore, good Grumio, the
1 1954 news?
1 1955   GRUMIO. Why, 'Jack boy! ho, boy!' and as much news as thou
1 1956 wilt.
1 1957   CURTIS. Come, you are so full of cony-catching!
1 1958   GRUMIO. Why, therefore, fire; for I have caught extreme cold. 
1 1959     Where's the cook? Is supper ready, the house trimm'd, rushes
1 1960     strew'd, cobwebs swept, the serving-men in their new fustian,
1 1961     their white stockings, and every officer his wedding-garment
1 1962 on?
1 1963     Be the jacks fair within, the jills fair without, the carpets
1 1964     laid, and everything in order?
1 1965   CURTIS. All ready; and therefore, I pray thee, news.
1 1966   GRUMIO. First know my horse is tired; my master and mistress
1 1967 fall'n
1 1968     out.
1 1969   CURTIS. How?
1 1970   GRUMIO. Out of their saddles into the dirt; and thereby hangs a
1 1971     tale.
1 1972   CURTIS. Let's ha't, good Grumio.
1 1973   GRUMIO. Lend thine ear.
1 1974   CURTIS. Here.
1 1975   GRUMIO. There.                                  [Striking him]
1 1976   CURTIS. This 'tis to feel a tale, not to hear a tale.
1 1977   GRUMIO. And therefore 'tis call'd a sensible tale; and this
1 1978 cuff
1 1979     was but to knock at your car and beseech list'ning. Now I
1 1980 begin:
1 1981     Imprimis, we came down a foul hill, my master riding behind
1 1982 my
1 1983     mistress- 
1 1984   CURTIS. Both of one horse?
1 1985   GRUMIO. What's that to thee?
1 1986   CURTIS. Why, a horse.
1 1987   GRUMIO. Tell thou the tale. But hadst thou not cross'd me, thou
1 1988     shouldst have heard how her horse fell and she under her
1 1989 horse;
1 1990     thou shouldst have heard in how miry a place, how she was
1 1991     bemoil'd, how he left her with the horse upon her, how he
1 1992 beat me
1 1993     because her horse stumbled, how she waded through the dirt to
1 1994     pluck him off me, how he swore, how she pray'd that never
1 1995 pray'd
1 1996     before, how I cried, how the horses ran away, how her bridle
1 1997 was
1 1998     burst, how I lost my crupper- with many things of worthy
1 1999 memory,
1 2000     which now shall die in oblivion, and thou return
1 2001 unexperienc'd to
1 2002     thy grave.
1 2003   CURTIS. By this reck'ning he is more shrew than she.
1 2004   GRUMIO. Ay, and that thou and the proudest of you all shall
1 2005 find
1 2006     when he comes home. But what talk I of this? Call forth
1 2007     Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip, Walter, Sugarsop, and
1 2008 the
1 2009     rest; let their heads be sleekly comb'd, their blue coats
1 2010 brush'd
1 2011     and their garters of an indifferent knit; let them curtsy
1 2012 with
1 2013     their left legs, and not presume to touch a hair of my
1 2014 master's 
1 2015     horse-tail till they kiss their hands. Are they all ready?
1 2016   CURTIS. They are.
1 2017   GRUMIO. Call them forth.
1 2018   CURTIS. Do you hear, ho? You must meet my master, to
1 2019 countenance my
1 2020     mistress.
1 2021   GRUMIO. Why, she hath a face of her own.
1 2022   CURTIS. Who knows not that?
1 2023   GRUMIO. Thou, it seems, that calls for company to countenance
1 2024 her.
1 2025   CURTIS. I call them forth to credit her.
1 2026   GRUMIO. Why, she comes to borrow nothing of them.
1 2027 
1 2028                      Enter four or five SERVINGMEN
1 2029 
1 2030   NATHANIEL. Welcome home, Grumio!
1 2031   PHILIP. How now, Grumio!
1 2032   JOSEPH. What, Grumio!
1 2033   NICHOLAS. Fellow Grumio!
1 2034   NATHANIEL. How now, old lad!
1 2035   GRUMIO. Welcome, you!- how now, you!- what, you!- fellow, you!-
1 2036 and
1 2037     thus much for greeting. Now, my spruce companions, is all
1 2038 ready, 
1 2039     and all things neat?
1 2040   NATHANIEL. All things is ready. How near is our master?
1 2041   GRUMIO. E'en at hand, alighted by this; and therefore be not-
1 2042    Cock's passion, silence! I hear my master.
1 2043 
1 2044                      Enter PETRUCHIO and KATHERINA
1 2045 
1 2046   PETRUCHIO. Where be these knaves? What, no man at door
1 2047     To hold my stirrup nor to take my horse!
1 2048     Where is Nathaniel, Gregory, Philip?
1 2049   ALL SERVANTS. Here, here, sir; here, sir.
1 2050   PETRUCHIO. Here, sir! here, sir! here, sir! here, sir!
1 2051     You logger-headed and unpolish'd grooms!
1 2052     What, no attendance? no regard? no duty?
1 2053     Where is the foolish knave I sent before?
1 2054   GRUMIO. Here, sir; as foolish as I was before.
1 2055   PETRUCHIO. YOU peasant swain! you whoreson malt-horse drudge!
1 2056     Did I not bid thee meet me in the park
1 2057     And bring along these rascal knaves with thee?
1 2058   GRUMIO. Nathaniel's coat, sir, was not fully made, 
1 2059     And Gabriel's pumps were all unpink'd i' th' heel;
1 2060     There was no link to colour Peter's hat,
1 2061     And Walter's dagger was not come from sheathing;
1 2062     There were none fine but Adam, Ralph, and Gregory;
1 2063     The rest were ragged, old, and beggarly;
1 2064     Yet, as they are, here are they come to meet you.
1 2065   PETRUCHIO. Go, rascals, go and fetch my supper in.
1 2066                                    Exeunt some of the SERVINGMEN
1 2067 
1 2068     [Sings]  Where is the life that late I led?
1 2069              Where are those-
1 2070 
1 2071     Sit down, Kate, and welcome. Soud, soud, soud, soud!
1 2072 
1 2073                  Re-enter SERVANTS with supper
1 2074 
1 2075     Why, when, I say? Nay, good sweet Kate, be merry.
1 2076     Off with my boots, you rogues! you villains, when?
1 2077 
1 2078     [Sings]  It was the friar of orders grey, 
1 2079              As he forth walked on his way-
1 2080 
1 2081     Out, you rogue! you pluck my foot awry;
1 2082     Take that, and mend the plucking off the other.
1 2083                                                    [Strikes him]
1 2084     Be merry, Kate. Some water, here, what, ho!
1 2085 
1 2086                       Enter one with water
1 2087 
1 2088     Where's my spaniel Troilus? Sirrah, get you hence,
1 2089     And bid my cousin Ferdinand come hither:
1 2090                                                  Exit SERVINGMAN
1 2091     One, Kate, that you must kiss and be acquainted with.
1 2092     Where are my slippers? Shall I have some water?
1 2093     Come, Kate, and wash, and welcome heartily.
1 2094     You whoreson villain! will you let it fall?    [Strikes him]
1 2095   KATHERINA. Patience, I pray you; 'twas a fault unwilling.
1 2096   PETRUCHIO. A whoreson, beetle-headed, flap-ear'd knave!
1 2097     Come, Kate, sit down; I know you have a stomach.
1 2098     Will you give thanks, sweet Kate, or else shall I? 
1 2099     What's this? Mutton?
1 2100   FIRST SERVANT. Ay.
1 2101   PETRUCHIO. Who brought it?
1 2102   PETER. I.
1 2103   PETRUCHIO. 'Tis burnt; and so is all the meat.
1 2104     What dogs are these? Where is the rascal cook?
1 2105     How durst you villains bring it from the dresser
1 2106     And serve it thus to me that love it not?
1 2107     There, take it to you, trenchers, cups, and all;
1 2108                                 [Throws the meat, etc., at them]
1 2109     You heedless joltheads and unmanner'd slaves!
1 2110     What, do you grumble? I'll be with you straight.
1 2111                                                  Exeunt SERVANTS
1 2112   KATHERINA. I pray you, husband, be not so disquiet;
1 2113     The meat was well, if you were so contented.
1 2114   PETRUCHIO. I tell thee, Kate, 'twas burnt and dried away,
1 2115     And I expressly am forbid to touch it;
1 2116     For it engenders choler, planteth anger;
1 2117     And better 'twere that both of us did fast,
1 2118     Since, of ourselves, ourselves are choleric, 
1 2119     Than feed it with such over-roasted flesh.
1 2120     Be patient; to-morrow 't shall be mended.
1 2121     And for this night we'll fast for company.
1 2122     Come, I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber.        Exeunt
1 2123 
1 2124                      Re-enter SERVANTS severally
1 2125 
1 2126   NATHANIEL. Peter, didst ever see the like?
1 2127   PETER. He kills her in her own humour.
1 2128 
1 2129                             Re-enter CURTIS
1 2130 
1 2131   GRUMIO. Where is he?
1 2132   CURTIS. In her chamber. Making a sermon of continency to her,
1 2133     And rails, and swears, and rates, that she, poor soul,
1 2134     Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak.
1 2135     And sits as one new risen from a dream.
1 2136     Away, away! for he is coming hither.                  Exeunt
1 2137 
1 2138                        Re-enter PETRUCHIO 
1 2139 
1 2140   PETRUCHIO. Thus have I politicly begun my reign,
1 2141     And 'tis my hope to end successfully.
1 2142     My falcon now is sharp and passing empty.
1 2143     And till she stoop she must not be full-gorg'd,
1 2144     For then she never looks upon her lure.
1 2145     Another way I have to man my haggard,
1 2146     To make her come, and know her keeper's call,
1 2147     That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites
1 2148     That bate and beat, and will not be obedient.
1 2149     She eat no meat to-day, nor none shall eat;
1 2150     Last night she slept not, nor to-night she shall not;
1 2151     As with the meat, some undeserved fault
1 2152     I'll find about the making of the bed;
1 2153     And here I'll fling the pillow, there the bolster,
1 2154     This way the coverlet, another way the sheets;
1 2155     Ay, and amid this hurly I intend
1 2156     That all is done in reverend care of her-
1 2157     And, in conclusion, she shall watch all night;
1 2158     And if she chance to nod I'll rail and brawl 
1 2159     And with the clamour keep her still awake.
1 2160     This is a way to kill a wife with kindness,
1 2161     And thus I'll curb her mad and headstrong humour.
1 2162     He that knows better how to tame a shrew,
1 2163     Now let him speak; 'tis charity to show.                Exit

1 2168 SCENE II.
1 2169 Padua. Before BAPTISTA'S house
1 2170 
1 2171 Enter TRANIO as LUCENTIO, and HORTENSIO as LICIO
1 2172 
1 2173   TRANIO. Is 't possible, friend Licio, that Mistress Bianca
1 2174     Doth fancy any other but Lucentio?
1 2175     I tell you, sir, she bears me fair in hand.
1 2176   HORTENSIO. Sir, to satisfy you in what I have said,
1 2177     Stand by and mark the manner of his teaching.
1 2178                                               [They stand aside]
1 2179 
1 2180                Enter BIANCA, and LUCENTIO as CAMBIO
1 2181 
1 2182   LUCENTIO. Now, mistress, profit you in what you read?
1 2183   BIANCA. What, master, read you, First resolve me that.
1 2184   LUCENTIO. I read that I profess, 'The Art to Love.'
1 2185   BIANCA. And may you prove, sir, master of your art!
1 2186   LUCENTIO. While you, sweet dear, prove mistress of my heart.
1 2187                                                    [They retire]
1 2188   HORTENSIO. Quick proceeders, marry! Now tell me, I pray,
1 2189     You that durst swear that your Mistress Blanca 
1 2190     Lov'd none in the world so well as Lucentio.
1 2191   TRANIO. O despiteful love! unconstant womankind!
1 2192     I tell thee, Licio, this is wonderful.
1 2193   HORTENSIO. Mistake no more; I am not Licio.
1 2194     Nor a musician as I seem to be;
1 2195     But one that scorn to live in this disguise
1 2196     For such a one as leaves a gentleman
1 2197     And makes a god of such a cullion.
1 2198     Know, sir, that I am call'd Hortensio.
1 2199   TRANIO. Signior Hortensio, I have often heard
1 2200     Of your entire affection to Bianca;
1 2201     And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness,
1 2202     I will with you, if you be so contented,
1 2203     Forswear Bianca and her love for ever.
1 2204   HORTENSIO. See, how they kiss and court! Signior Lucentio,
1 2205     Here is my hand, and here I firmly vow
1 2206     Never to woo her more, but do forswear her,
1 2207     As one unworthy all the former favours
1 2208     That I have fondly flatter'd her withal.
1 2209   TRANIO. And here I take the like unfeigned oath, 
1 2210     Never to marry with her though she would entreat;
1 2211     Fie on her! See how beastly she doth court him!
1 2212   HORTENSIO. Would all the world but he had quite forsworn!
1 2213     For me, that I may surely keep mine oath,
1 2214     I will be married to a wealthy widow
1 2215     Ere three days pass, which hath as long lov'd me
1 2216     As I have lov'd this proud disdainful haggard.
1 2217     And so farewell, Signior Lucentio.
1 2218     Kindness in women, not their beauteous looks,
1 2219     Shall win my love; and so I take my leave,
1 2220     In resolution as I swore before.                        Exit
1 2221   TRANIO. Mistress Bianca, bless you with such grace
1 2222     As 'longeth to a lover's blessed case!
1 2223     Nay, I have ta'en you napping, gentle love,
1 2224     And have forsworn you with Hortensio.
1 2225   BIANCA. Tranio, you jest; but have you both forsworn me?
1 2226   TRANIO. Mistress, we have.
1 2227   LUCENTIO. Then we are rid of Licio.
1 2228   TRANIO. I' faith, he'll have a lusty widow now,
1 2229     That shall be woo'd and wedded in a day. 
1 2230   BIANCA. God give him joy!
1 2231   TRANIO. Ay, and he'll tame her.
1 2232   BIANCA. He says so, Tranio.
1 2233   TRANIO. Faith, he is gone unto the taming-school.
1 2234   BIANCA. The taming-school! What, is there such a place?
1 2235   TRANIO. Ay, mistress; and Petruchio is the master,
1 2236     That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long,
1 2237     To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue.
1 2238 
1 2239                        Enter BIONDELLO
1 2240 
1 2241   BIONDELLO. O master, master, have watch'd so long
1 2242     That I am dog-weary; but at last I spied
1 2243     An ancient angel coming down the hill
1 2244     Will serve the turn.
1 2245   TRANIO. What is he, Biondello?
1 2246   BIONDELLO. Master, a mercatante or a pedant,
1 2247     I know not what; but formal in apparel,
1 2248     In gait and countenance surely like a father.
1 2249   LUCENTIO. And what of him, Tranio? 
1 2250   TRANIO. If he be credulous and trust my tale,
1 2251     I'll make him glad to seem Vincentio,
1 2252     And give assurance to Baptista Minola
1 2253     As if he were the right Vincentio.
1 2254     Take in your love, and then let me alone.
1 2255                                       Exeunt LUCENTIO and BIANCA
1 2256 
1 2257                          Enter a PEDANT
1 2258 
1 2259   PEDANT. God save you, sir!
1 2260   TRANIO. And you, sir; you are welcome.
1 2261     Travel you far on, or are you at the farthest?
1 2262   PEDANT. Sir, at the farthest for a week or two;
1 2263     But then up farther, and as far as Rome;
1 2264     And so to Tripoli, if God lend me life.
1 2265   TRANIO. What countryman, I pray?
1 2266   PEDANT. Of Mantua.
1 2267   TRANIO. Of Mantua, sir? Marry, God forbid,
1 2268     And come to Padua, careless of your life!
1 2269   PEDANT. My life, sir! How, I pray? For that goes hard. 
1 2270   TRANIO. 'Tis death for any one in Mantua
1 2271     To come to Padua. Know you not the cause?
1 2272     Your ships are stay'd at Venice; and the Duke,
1 2273     For private quarrel 'twixt your Duke and him,
1 2274     Hath publish'd and proclaim'd it openly.
1 2275     'Tis marvel- but that you are but newly come,
1 2276     You might have heard it else proclaim'd about.
1 2277   PEDANT. Alas, sir, it is worse for me than so!
1 2278     For I have bills for money by exchange
1 2279     From Florence, and must here deliver them.
1 2280   TRANIO. Well, sir, to do you courtesy,
1 2281     This will I do, and this I will advise you-
1 2282     First, tell me, have you ever been at Pisa?
1 2283   PEDANT. Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been,
1 2284     Pisa renowned for grave citizens.
1 2285   TRANIO. Among them know you one Vincentio?
1 2286   PEDANT. I know him not, but I have heard of him,
1 2287     A merchant of incomparable wealth.
1 2288   TRANIO. He is my father, sir; and, sooth to say,
1 2289     In count'nance somewhat doth resemble you. 
1 2290   BIONDELLO.  [Aside]  As much as an apple doth an oyster, and
1 2291 all
1 2292     one.
1 2293   TRANIO. To save your life in this extremity,
1 2294     This favour will I do you for his sake;
1 2295     And think it not the worst of all your fortunes
1 2296     That you are like to Sir Vincentio.
1 2297     His name and credit shall you undertake,
1 2298     And in my house you shall be friendly lodg'd;
1 2299     Look that you take upon you as you should.
1 2300     You understand me, sir. So shall you stay
1 2301     Till you have done your business in the city.
1 2302     If this be court'sy, sir, accept of it.
1 2303   PEDANT. O, sir, I do; and will repute you ever
1 2304     The patron of my life and liberty.
1 2305   TRANIO. Then go with me to make the matter good.
1 2306     This, by the way, I let you understand:
1 2307     My father is here look'd for every day
1 2308     To pass assurance of a dow'r in marriage
1 2309     'Twixt me and one Baptista's daughter here.
1 2310     In all these circumstances I'll instruct you. 
1 2311     Go with me to clothe you as becomes you.              Exeunt
1 2312 
1 2313 
1 2314 
1 2315 
1 2316 SCENE III.
1 2317 PETRUCHIO'S house
1 2318 
1 2319 Enter KATHERINA and GRUMIO
1 2320 
1 2321   GRUMIO. No, no, forsooth; I dare not for my life.
1 2322   KATHERINA. The more my wrong, the more his spite appears.
1 2323     What, did he marry me to famish me?
1 2324     Beggars that come unto my father's door
1 2325     Upon entreaty have a present alms;
1 2326     If not, elsewhere they meet with charity;
1 2327     But I, who never knew how to entreat,
1 2328     Nor never needed that I should entreat,
1 2329     Am starv'd for meat, giddy for lack of sleep;
1 2330     With oaths kept waking, and with brawling fed;
1 2331     And that which spites me more than all these wants-
1 2332     He does it under name of perfect love;
1 2333     As who should say, if I should sleep or eat,
1 2334     'Twere deadly sickness or else present death.
1 2335     I prithee go and get me some repast;
1 2336     I care not what, so it be wholesome food.
1 2337   GRUMIO. What say you to a neat's foot? 
1 2338   KATHERINA. 'Tis passing good; I prithee let me have it.
1 2339   GRUMIO. I fear it is too choleric a meat.
1 2340     How say you to a fat tripe finely broil'd?
1 2341   KATHERINA. I like it well; good Grumio, fetch it me.
1 2342   GRUMIO. I cannot tell; I fear 'tis choleric.
1 2343     What say you to a piece of beef and mustard?
1 2344   KATHERINA. A dish that I do love to feed upon.
1 2345   GRUMIO. Ay, but the mustard is too hot a little.
1 2346   KATHERINA. Why then the beef, and let the mustard rest.
1 2347   GRUMIO. Nay, then I will not; you shall have the mustard,
1 2348     Or else you get no beef of Grumio.
1 2349   KATHERINA. Then both, or one, or anything thou wilt.
1 2350   GRUMIO. Why then the mustard without the beef.
1 2351   KATHERINA. Go, get thee gone, thou false deluding slave,
1 2352                                                      [Beats him]
1 2353     That feed'st me with the very name of meat.
1 2354     Sorrow on thee and all the pack of you
1 2355     That triumph thus upon my misery!
1 2356     Go, get thee gone, I say.
1 2357  
1 2358                Enter PETRUCHIO, and HORTENSIO with meat
1 2359 
1 2360   PETRUCHIO. How fares my Kate? What, sweeting, all amort?
1 2361   HORTENSIO. Mistress, what cheer?
1 2362   KATHERINA. Faith, as cold as can be.
1 2363   PETRUCHIO. Pluck up thy spirits, look cheerfully upon me.
1 2364     Here, love, thou seest how diligent I am,
1 2365     To dress thy meat myself, and bring it thee.
1 2366     I am sure, sweet Kate, this kindness merits thanks.
1 2367     What, not a word? Nay, then thou lov'st it not,
1 2368     And all my pains is sorted to no proof.
1 2369     Here, take away this dish.
1 2370   KATHERINA. I pray you, let it stand.
1 2371   PETRUCHIO. The poorest service is repaid with thanks;
1 2372     And so shall mine, before you touch the meat.
1 2373   KATHERINA. I thank you, sir.
1 2374   HORTENSIO. Signior Petruchio, fie! you are to blame.
1 2375     Come, Mistress Kate, I'll bear you company.
1 2376   PETRUCHIO.  [Aside]  Eat it up all, Hortensio, if thou lovest
1 2377 me.-
1 2378     Much good do it unto thy gentle heart! 
1 2379     Kate, eat apace. And now, my honey love,
1 2380     Will we return unto thy father's house
1 2381     And revel it as bravely as the best,
1 2382     With silken coats and caps, and golden rings,
1 2383     With ruffs and cuffs and farthingales and things,
1 2384     With scarfs and fans and double change of brav'ry.
1 2385     With amber bracelets, beads, and all this knav'ry.
1 2386     What, hast thou din'd? The tailor stays thy leisure,
1 2387     To deck thy body with his ruffling treasure.
1 2388 
1 2389                           Enter TAILOR
1 2390 
1 2391     Come, tailor, let us see these ornaments;
1 2392     Lay forth the gown.
1 2393 
1 2394                         Enter HABERDASHER
1 2395 
1 2396     What news with you, sir?
1 2397   HABERDASHER. Here is the cap your worship did bespeak.
1 2398   PETRUCHIO. Why, this was moulded on a porringer; 
1 2399     A velvet dish. Fie, fie! 'tis lewd and filthy;
1 2400     Why, 'tis a cockle or a walnut-shell,
1 2401     A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby's cap.
1 2402     Away with it. Come, let me have a bigger.
1 2403   KATHERINA. I'll have no bigger; this doth fit the time,
1 2404     And gentlewomen wear such caps as these.
1 2405   PETRUCHIO. When you are gentle, you shall have one too,
1 2406     And not till then.
1 2407   HORTENSIO.  [Aside]  That will not be in haste.
1 2408   KATHERINA. Why, sir, I trust I may have leave to speak;
1 2409     And speak I will. I am no child, no babe.
1 2410     Your betters have endur'd me say my mind,
1 2411     And if you cannot, best you stop your ears.
1 2412     My tongue will tell the anger of my heart,
1 2413     Or else my heart, concealing it, will break;
1 2414     And rather than it shall, I will be free
1 2415     Even to the uttermost, as I please, in words.
1 2416   PETRUCHIO. Why, thou say'st true; it is a paltry cap,
1 2417     A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie;
1 2418     I love thee well in that thou lik'st it not. 
1 2419   KATHERINA. Love me or love me not, I like the cap;
1 2420     And it I will have, or I will have none.    Exit HABERDASHER
1 2421   PETRUCHIO. Thy gown? Why, ay. Come, tailor, let us see't.
1 2422     O mercy, God! what masquing stuff is here?
1 2423     What's this? A sleeve? 'Tis like a demi-cannon.
1 2424     What, up and down, carv'd like an appletart?
1 2425     Here's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash,
1 2426     Like to a censer in a barber's shop.
1 2427     Why, what a devil's name, tailor, call'st thou this?
1 2428   HORTENSIO.  [Aside]  I see she's like to have neither cap nor
1 2429 gown.
1 2430   TAILOR. You bid me make it orderly and well,
1 2431     According to the fashion and the time.
1 2432   PETRUCHIO. Marry, and did; but if you be rememb'red,
1 2433     I did not bid you mar it to the time.
1 2434     Go, hop me over every kennel home,
1 2435     For you shall hop without my custom, sir.
1 2436     I'll none of it; hence! make your best of it.
1 2437   KATHERINA. I never saw a better fashion'd gown,
1 2438     More quaint, more pleasing, nor more commendable;
1 2439     Belike you mean to make a puppet of me. 
1 2440   PETRUCHIO. Why, true; he means to make a puppet of thee.
1 2441   TAILOR. She says your worship means to make a puppet of her.
1 2442   PETRUCHIO. O monstrous arrogance! Thou liest, thou thread, thou
1 2443       thimble,
1 2444     Thou yard, three-quarters, half-yard, quarter, nail,
1 2445     Thou flea, thou nit, thou winter-cricket thou-
1 2446     Brav'd in mine own house with a skein of thread!
1 2447     Away, thou rag, thou quantity, thou remnant;
1 2448     Or I shall so bemete thee with thy yard
1 2449     As thou shalt think on prating whilst thou liv'st!
1 2450     I tell thee, I, that thou hast marr'd her gown.
1 2451   TAILOR. Your worship is deceiv'd; the gown is made
1 2452     Just as my master had direction.
1 2453     Grumio gave order how it should be done.
1 2454   GRUMIO. I gave him no order; I gave him the stuff.
1 2455   TAILOR. But how did you desire it should be made?
1 2456   GRUMIO. Marry, sir, with needle and thread.
1 2457   TAILOR. But did you not request to have it cut?
1 2458   GRUMIO. Thou hast fac'd many things.
1 2459   TAILOR. I have. 
1 2460   GRUMIO. Face not me. Thou hast brav'd many men; brave not me. I
1 2461     will neither be fac'd nor brav'd. I say unto thee, I bid thy
1 2462     master cut out the gown; but I did not bid him cut it to
1 2463 pieces.
1 2464     Ergo, thou liest.
1 2465   TAILOR. Why, here is the note of the fashion to testify.
1 2466   PETRUCHIO. Read it.
1 2467   GRUMIO. The note lies in's throat, if he say I said so.
1 2468   TAILOR.  [Reads]  'Imprimis, a loose-bodied gown'-
1 2469   GRUMIO. Master, if ever I said loose-bodied gown, sew me in the
1 2470     skirts of it and beat me to death with a bottom of brown
1 2471 bread; I
1 2472     said a gown.
1 2473   PETRUCHIO. Proceed.
1 2474   TAILOR.  [Reads]  'With a small compass'd cape'-
1 2475   GRUMIO. I confess the cape.
1 2476   TAILOR.  [Reads]  'With a trunk sleeve'-
1 2477   GRUMIO. I confess two sleeves.
1 2478   TAILOR.  [Reads]  'The sleeves curiously cut.'
1 2479   PETRUCHIO. Ay, there's the villainy.
1 2480   GRUMIO. Error i' th' bill, sir; error i' th' bill! I commanded
1 2481 the
1 2482     sleeves should be cut out, and sew'd up again; and that I'll 
1 2483     prove upon thee, though thy little finger be armed in a
1 2484 thimble.
1 2485   TAILOR. This is true that I say; an I had thee in place where,
1 2486 thou
1 2487     shouldst know it.
1 2488   GRUMIO. I am for thee straight; take thou the bill, give me thy
1 2489     meteyard, and spare not me.
1 2490   HORTENSIO. God-a-mercy, Grumio! Then he shall have no odds.
1 2491   PETRUCHIO. Well, sir, in brief, the gown is not for me.
1 2492   GRUMIO. You are i' th' right, sir; 'tis for my mistress.
1 2493   PETRUCHIO. Go, take it up unto thy master's use.
1 2494   GRUMIO. Villain, not for thy life! Take up my mistress' gown
1 2495 for
1 2496     thy master's use!
1 2497   PETRUCHIO. Why, sir, what's your conceit in that?
1 2498   GRUMIO. O, sir, the conceit is deeper than you think for.
1 2499     Take up my mistress' gown to his master's use!
1 2500     O fie, fie, fie!
1 2501   PETRUCHIO.  [Aside]  Hortensio, say thou wilt see the tailor
1 2502 paid.-
1 2503     Go take it hence; be gone, and say no more.
1 2504   HORTENSIO. Tailor, I'll pay thee for thy gown to-morrow;
1 2505     Take no unkindness of his hasty words.
1 2506     Away, I say; commend me to thy master.           Exit TAILOR 
1 2507   PETRUCHIO. Well, come, my Kate; we will unto your father's
1 2508     Even in these honest mean habiliments;
1 2509     Our purses shall be proud, our garments poor;
1 2510     For 'tis the mind that makes the body rich;
1 2511     And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds,
1 2512     So honour peereth in the meanest habit.
1 2513     What, is the jay more precious than the lark
1 2514     Because his feathers are more beautiful?
1 2515     Or is the adder better than the eel
1 2516     Because his painted skin contents the eye?
1 2517     O no, good Kate; neither art thou the worse
1 2518     For this poor furniture and mean array.
1 2519     If thou account'st it shame, lay it on me;
1 2520     And therefore frolic; we will hence forthwith
1 2521     To feast and sport us at thy father's house.
1 2522     Go call my men, and let us straight to him;
1 2523     And bring our horses unto Long-lane end;
1 2524     There will we mount, and thither walk on foot.
1 2525     Let's see; I think 'tis now some seven o'clock,
1 2526     And well we may come there by dinner-time. 
1 2527   KATHERINA. I dare assure you, sir, 'tis almost two,
1 2528     And 'twill be supper-time ere you come there.
1 2529   PETRUCHIO. It shall be seven ere I go to horse.
1 2530     Look what I speak, or do, or think to do,
1 2531     You are still crossing it. Sirs, let 't alone;
1 2532     I will not go to-day; and ere I do,
1 2533     It shall be what o'clock I say it is.
1 2534   HORTENSIO. Why, so this gallant will command the sun.
1 2535                                                           Exeunt

1 2540 SCENE IV.
1 2541 Padua. Before BAPTISTA'S house
1 2542 
1 2543 Enter TRANIO as LUCENTIO, and the PEDANT dressed like VINCENTIO
1 2544 
1 2545   TRANIO. Sir, this is the house; please it you that I call?
1 2546   PEDANT. Ay, what else? And, but I be deceived,
1 2547     Signior Baptista may remember me
1 2548     Near twenty years ago in Genoa,
1 2549     Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus.
1 2550   TRANIO. 'Tis well; and hold your own, in any case,
1 2551     With such austerity as longeth to a father.
1 2552 
1 2553                        Enter BIONDELLO
1 2554 
1 2555   PEDANT. I warrant you. But, sir, here comes your boy;
1 2556     'Twere good he were school'd.
1 2557   TRANIO. Fear you not him. Sirrah Biondello,
1 2558     Now do your duty throughly, I advise you.
1 2559     Imagine 'twere the right Vincentio.
1 2560   BIONDELLO. Tut, fear not me. 
1 2561   TRANIO. But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista?
1 2562   BIONDELLO. I told him that your father was at Venice,
1 2563     And that you look'd for him this day in Padua.
1 2564   TRANIO. Th'art a tall fellow; hold thee that to drink.
1 2565     Here comes Baptista. Set your countenance, sir.
1 2566 
1 2567                  Enter BAPTISTA, and LUCENTIO as CAMBIO
1 2568 
1 2569     Signior Baptista, you are happily met.
1 2570     [To the PEDANT] Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of;
1 2571     I pray you stand good father to me now;
1 2572     Give me Bianca for my patrimony.
1 2573   PEDANT. Soft, son!
1 2574     Sir, by your leave: having come to Padua
1 2575     To gather in some debts, my son Lucentio
1 2576     Made me acquainted with a weighty cause
1 2577     Of love between your daughter and himself;
1 2578     And- for the good report I hear of you,
1 2579     And for the love he beareth to your daughter,
1 2580     And she to him- to stay him not too long, 
1 2581     I am content, in a good father's care,
1 2582     To have him match'd; and, if you please to like
1 2583     No worse than I, upon some agreement
1 2584     Me shall you find ready and willing
1 2585     With one consent to have her so bestow'd;
1 2586     For curious I cannot be with you,
1 2587     Signior Baptista, of whom I hear so well.
1 2588   BAPTISTA. Sir, pardon me in what I have to say.
1 2589     Your plainness and your shortness please me well.
1 2590     Right true it is your son Lucentio here
1 2591     Doth love my daughter, and she loveth him,
1 2592     Or both dissemble deeply their affections;
1 2593     And therefore, if you say no more than this,
1 2594     That like a father you will deal with him,
1 2595     And pass my daughter a sufficient dower,
1 2596     The match is made, and all is done-
1 2597     Your son shall have my daughter with consent.
1 2598   TRANIO. I thank you, sir. Where then do you know best
1 2599     We be affied, and such assurance ta'en
1 2600     As shall with either part's agreement stand? 
1 2601   BAPTISTA. Not in my house, Lucentio, for you know
1 2602     Pitchers have ears, and I have many servants;
1 2603     Besides, old Gremio is heark'ning still,
1 2604     And happily we might be interrupted.
1 2605   TRANIO. Then at my lodging, an it like you.
1 2606     There doth my father lie; and there this night
1 2607     We'll pass the business privately and well.
1 2608     Send for your daughter by your servant here;
1 2609     My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently.
1 2610     The worst is this, that at so slender warning
1 2611     You are like to have a thin and slender pittance.
1 2612   BAPTISTA. It likes me well. Cambio, hie you home,
1 2613     And bid Bianca make her ready straight;
1 2614     And, if you will, tell what hath happened-
1 2615     Lucentio's father is arriv'd in Padua,
1 2616     And how she's like to be Lucentio's wife.      Exit LUCENTIO
1 2617   BIONDELLO. I pray the gods she may, with all my heart.
1 2618   TRANIO. Dally not with the gods, but get thee gone.
1 2619                                                   Exit BIONDELLO
1 2620     Signior Baptista, shall I lead the way? 
1 2621     Welcome! One mess is like to be your cheer;
1 2622     Come, sir; we will better it in Pisa.
1 2623   BAPTISTA. I follow you.                                 Exeunt
1 2624 
1 2625             Re-enter LUCENTIO as CAMBIO, and BIONDELLO
1 2626 
1 2627   BIONDELLO. Cambio.
1 2628   LUCENTIO. What say'st thou, Biondello?
1 2629   BIONDELLO. You saw my master wink and laugh upon you?
1 2630   LUCENTIO. Biondello, what of that?
1 2631   BIONDELLO. Faith, nothing; but has left me here behind to
1 2632 expound
1 2633     the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens.
1 2634   LUCENTIO. I pray thee moralize them.
1 2635   BIONDELLO. Then thus: Baptista is safe, talking with the
1 2636 deceiving
1 2637     father of a deceitful son.
1 2638   LUCENTIO. And what of him?
1 2639   BIONDELLO. His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper.
1 2640   LUCENTIO. And then?
1 2641   BIONDELLO. The old priest at Saint Luke's church is at your
1 2642 command
1 2643     at all hours. 
1 2644   LUCENTIO. And what of all this?
1 2645   BIONDELLO. I cannot tell, except they are busied about a
1 2646     counterfeit assurance. Take your assurance of her, cum
1 2647 privilegio
1 2648     ad imprimendum solum; to th' church take the priest, clerk,
1 2649 and
1 2650     some sufficient honest witnesses.
1 2651     If this be not that you look for, I have more to say,
1 2652     But bid Bianca farewell for ever and a day.
1 2653   LUCENTIO. Hear'st thou, Biondello?
1 2654   BIONDELLO. I cannot tarry. I knew a wench married in an
1 2655 afternoon
1 2656     as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit; and
1 2657 so
1 2658     may you, sir; and so adieu, sir. My master hath appointed me
1 2659 to
1 2660     go to Saint Luke's to bid the priest be ready to come against
1 2661 you
1 2662     come with your appendix.
1 2663  Exit
1 2664   LUCENTIO. I may and will, if she be so contented.
1 2665     She will be pleas'd; then wherefore should I doubt?
1 2666     Hap what hap may, I'll roundly go about her;
1 2667     It shall go hard if Cambio go without her.              Exit
1 2668 
1 2669 
1 2670 
1 2671 
1 2672 SCENE V.
1 2673 A public road
1 2674 
1 2675 Enter PETRUCHIO, KATHERINA, HORTENSIO, and SERVANTS
1 2676 
1 2677   PETRUCHIO. Come on, a God's name; once more toward our
1 2678 father's.
1 2679     Good Lord, how bright and goodly shines the moon!
1 2680   KATHERINA. The moon? The sun! It is not moonlight now.
1 2681   PETRUCHIO. I say it is the moon that shines so bright.
1 2682   KATHERINA. I know it is the sun that shines so bright.
1 2683   PETRUCHIO. Now by my mother's son, and that's myself,
1 2684     It shall be moon, or star, or what I list,
1 2685     Or ere I journey to your father's house.
1 2686     Go on and fetch our horses back again.
1 2687     Evermore cross'd and cross'd; nothing but cross'd!
1 2688   HORTENSIO. Say as he says, or we shall never go.
1 2689   KATHERINA. Forward, I pray, since we have come so far,
1 2690     And be it moon, or sun, or what you please;
1 2691     And if you please to call it a rush-candle,
1 2692     Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me.
1 2693   PETRUCHIO. I say it is the moon.
1 2694   KATHERINA. I know it is the moon. 
1 2695   PETRUCHIO. Nay, then you lie; it is the blessed sun.
1 2696   KATHERINA. Then, God be bless'd, it is the blessed sun;
1 2697     But sun it is not, when you say it is not;
1 2698     And the moon changes even as your mind.
1 2699     What you will have it nam'd, even that it is,
1 2700     And so it shall be so for Katherine.
1 2701   HORTENSIO. Petruchio, go thy ways, the field is won.
1 2702   PETRUCHIO. Well, forward, forward! thus the bowl should run,
1 2703     And not unluckily against the bias.
1 2704     But, soft! Company is coming here.
1 2705 
1 2706                             Enter VINCENTIO
1 2707 
1 2708     [To VINCENTIO]  Good-morrow, gentle mistress; where away?-
1 2709     Tell me, sweet Kate, and tell me truly too,
1 2710     Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman?
1 2711     Such war of white and red within her cheeks!
1 2712     What stars do spangle heaven with such beauty
1 2713     As those two eyes become that heavenly face?
1 2714     Fair lovely maid, once more good day to thee. 
1 2715     Sweet Kate, embrace her for her beauty's sake.
1 2716   HORTENSIO. 'A will make the man mad, to make a woman of him.
1 2717   KATHERINA. Young budding virgin, fair and fresh and sweet,
1 2718     Whither away, or where is thy abode?
1 2719     Happy the parents of so fair a child;
1 2720     Happier the man whom favourable stars
1 2721     Allots thee for his lovely bed-fellow.
1 2722   PETRUCHIO. Why, how now, Kate, I hope thou art not mad!
1 2723     This is a man, old, wrinkled, faded, withered,
1 2724     And not a maiden, as thou sayst he is.
1 2725   KATHERINA. Pardon, old father, my mistaking eyes,
1 2726     That have been so bedazzled with the sun
1 2727     That everything I look on seemeth green;
1 2728     Now I perceive thou art a reverend father.
1 2729     Pardon, I pray thee, for my mad mistaking.
1 2730   PETRUCHIO. Do, good old grandsire, and withal make known
1 2731     Which way thou travellest- if along with us,
1 2732     We shall be joyful of thy company.
1 2733   VINCENTIO. Fair sir, and you my merry mistress,
1 2734     That with your strange encounter much amaz'd me, 
1 2735     My name is call'd Vincentio, my dwelling Pisa,
1 2736     And bound I am to Padua, there to visit
1 2737     A son of mine, which long I have not seen.
1 2738   PETRUCHIO. What is his name?
1 2739   VINCENTIO. Lucentio, gentle sir.
1 2740   PETRUCHIO. Happily met; the happier for thy son.
1 2741     And now by law, as well as reverend age,
1 2742     I may entitle thee my loving father:
1 2743     The sister to my wife, this gentlewoman,
1 2744     Thy son by this hath married. Wonder not,
1 2745     Nor be not grieved- she is of good esteem,
1 2746     Her dowry wealthy, and of worthy birth;
1 2747     Beside, so qualified as may beseem
1 2748     The spouse of any noble gentleman.
1 2749     Let me embrace with old Vincentio;
1 2750     And wander we to see thy honest son,
1 2751     Who will of thy arrival be full joyous.
1 2752   VINCENTIO. But is this true; or is it else your pleasure,
1 2753     Like pleasant travellers, to break a jest
1 2754     Upon the company you overtake? 
1 2755   HORTENSIO. I do assure thee, father, so it is.
1 2756   PETRUCHIO. Come, go along, and see the truth hereof;
1 2757     For our first merriment hath made thee jealous.
1 2758                                         Exeunt all but HORTENSIO
1 2759   HORTENSIO. Well, Petruchio, this has put me in heart.
1 2760     Have to my widow; and if she be froward,
1 2761     Then hast thou taught Hortensio to be untoward.         Exit
1 2762

1 2777 ACT V. SCENE I.
1 2778 Padua. Before LUCENTIO'S house
1 2779 
1 2780 Enter BIONDELLO, LUCENTIO, and BIANCA; GREMIO is out before
1 2781 
1 2782   BIONDELLO. Softly and swiftly, sir, for the priest is ready.
1 2783   LUCENTIO. I fly, Biondello; but they may chance to need thee at
1 2784     home, therefore leave us.
1 2785   BIONDELLO. Nay, faith, I'll see the church a your back, and
1 2786 then
1 2787     come back to my master's as soon as I can.
1 2788                           Exeunt LUCENTIO, BIANCA, and BIONDELLO
1 2789   GREMIO. I marvel Cambio comes not all this while.
1 2790 
1 2791            Enter PETRUCHIO, KATHERINA, VINCENTIO, GRUMIO,
1 2792                           and ATTENDANTS
1 2793 
1 2794   PETRUCHIO. Sir, here's the door; this is Lucentio's house;
1 2795     My father's bears more toward the market-place;
1 2796     Thither must I, and here I leave you, sir.
1 2797   VINCENTIO. You shall not choose but drink before you go;
1 2798     I think I shall command your welcome here, 
1 2799     And by all likelihood some cheer is toward.         [Knocks]
1 2800   GREMIO. They're busy within; you were best knock louder.
1 2801                                 [PEDANT looks out of the window]
1 2802   PEDANT. What's he that knocks as he would beat down the gate?
1 2803   VINCENTIO. Is Signior Lucentio within, sir?
1 2804   PEDANT. He's within, sir, but not to be spoken withal.
1 2805   VINCENTIO. What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two to
1 2806 make
1 2807     merry withal?
1 2808   PEDANT. Keep your hundred pounds to yourself; he shall need
1 2809 none so
1 2810     long as I live.
1 2811   PETRUCHIO. Nay, I told you your son was well beloved in Padua.
1 2812 Do
1 2813     you hear, sir? To leave frivolous circumstances, I pray you
1 2814 tell
1 2815     Signior Lucentio that his father is come from Pisa, and is
1 2816 here
1 2817     at the door to speak with him.
1 2818   PEDANT. Thou liest: his father is come from Padua, and here
1 2819 looking
1 2820     out at the window.
1 2821   VINCENTIO. Art thou his father?
1 2822   PEDANT. Ay, sir; so his mother says, if I may believe her.
1 2823   PETRUCHIO.  [To VINCENTIO]  Why, how now, gentleman!
1 2824     Why, this is flat knavery to take upon you another man's
1 2825 name. 
1 2826   PEDANT. Lay hands on the villain; I believe 'a means to cozen
1 2827     somebody in this city under my countenance.
1 2828 
1 2829                        Re-enter BIONDELLO
1 2830 
1 2831   BIONDELLO. I have seen them in the church together. God send
1 2832 'em
1 2833     good shipping! But who is here? Mine old master, Vicentio!
1 2834 Now we
1 2835     are undone and brought to nothing.
1 2836   VINCENTIO.  [Seeing BIONDELLO]  Come hither, crack-hemp.
1 2837   BIONDELLO. I hope I may choose, sir.
1 2838   VINCENTIO. Come hither, you rogue. What, have you forgot me?
1 2839   BIONDELLO. Forgot you! No, sir. I could not forget you, for I
1 2840 never
1 2841     saw you before in all my life.
1 2842   VINCENTIO. What, you notorious villain, didst thou never see
1 2843 thy
1 2844     master's father, Vincentio?
1 2845   BIONDELLO. What, my old worshipful old master? Yes, marry, sir;
1 2846 see
1 2847     where he looks out of the window.
1 2848   VINCENTIO. Is't so, indeed?               [He beats BIONDELLO]
1 2849   BIONDELLO. Help, help, help! Here's a madman will murder me.
1 2850  Exit 
1 2851   PEDANT. Help, son! help, Signior Baptista!     Exit from above
1 2852   PETRUCHIO. Prithee, Kate, let's stand aside and see the end of
1 2853 this
1 2854     controversy.                              [They stand aside]
1 2855 
1 2856        Re-enter PEDANT below; BAPTISTA, TRANIO, and SERVANTS
1 2857 
1 2858   TRANIO. Sir, what are you that offer to beat my servant?
1 2859   VINCENTIO. What am I, sir? Nay, what are you, sir? O immortal
1 2860 gods!
1 2861     O fine villain! A silken doublet, a velvet hose, a scarlet
1 2862 cloak,
1 2863     and a copatain hat! O, I am undone! I am undone! While I play
1 2864 the
1 2865     good husband at home, my son and my servant spend all at the
1 2866     university.
1 2867   TRANIO. How now! what's the matter?
1 2868   BAPTISTA. What, is the man lunatic?
1 2869   TRANIO. Sir, you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your habit,
1 2870 but
1 2871     your words show you a madman. Why, sir, what 'cerns it you if
1 2872 I
1 2873     wear pearl and gold? I thank my good father, I am able to
1 2874     maintain it.
1 2875   VINCENTIO. Thy father! O villain! he is a sailmaker in Bergamo.
1 2876   BAPTISTA. You mistake, sir; you mistake, sir. Pray, what do you
1 2877 
1 2878     think is his name?
1 2879   VINCENTIO. His name! As if I knew not his name! I have brought
1 2880 him
1 2881     up ever since he was three years old, and his name is Tranio.
1 2882   PEDANT. Away, away, mad ass! His name is Lucentio; and he is
1 2883 mine
1 2884     only son, and heir to the lands of me, Signior Vicentio.
1 2885   VINCENTIO. Lucentio! O, he hath murd'red his master! Lay hold
1 2886 on
1 2887     him, I charge you, in the Duke's name. O, my son, my son!
1 2888 Tell
1 2889     me, thou villain, where is my son, Lucentio?
1 2890   TRANIO. Call forth an officer.
1 2891 
1 2892                       Enter one with an OFFICER
1 2893 
1 2894     Carry this mad knave to the gaol. Father Baptista, I charge
1 2895 you
1 2896     see that he be forthcoming.
1 2897   VINCENTIO. Carry me to the gaol!
1 2898   GREMIO. Stay, Officer; he shall not go to prison.
1 2899   BAPTISTA. Talk not, Signior Gremio; I say he shall go to
1 2900 prison.
1 2901   GREMIO. Take heed, Signior Baptista, lest you be cony-catch'd
1 2902 in
1 2903     this business; I dare swear this is the right Vincentio.
1 2904   PEDANT. Swear if thou dar'st. 
1 2905   GREMIO. Nay, I dare not swear it.
1 2906   TRANIO. Then thou wert best say that I am not Lucentio.
1 2907   GREMIO. Yes, I know thee to be Signior Lucentio.
1 2908   BAPTISTA. Away with the dotard; to the gaol with him!
1 2909   VINCENTIO. Thus strangers may be hal'd and abus'd. O monstrous
1 2910     villain!
1 2911 
1 2912           Re-enter BIONDELLO, with LUCENTIO and BIANCA
1 2913 
1 2914   BIONDELLO. O, we are spoil'd; and yonder he is! Deny him,
1 2915 forswear
1 2916     him, or else we are all undone.
1 2917          Exeunt BIONDELLO, TRANIO, and PEDANT, as fast as may be
1 2918   LUCENTIO.  [Kneeling]  Pardon, sweet father.
1 2919   VINCENTIO. Lives my sweet son?
1 2920   BIANCA. Pardon, dear father.
1 2921   BAPTISTA. How hast thou offended?
1 2922     Where is Lucentio?
1 2923   LUCENTIO. Here's Lucentio,
1 2924     Right son to the right Vincentio,
1 2925     That have by marriage made thy daughter mine, 
1 2926     While counterfeit supposes blear'd thine eyne.
1 2927   GREMIO. Here's packing, with a witness, to deceive us all!
1 2928   VINCENTIO. Where is that damned villain, Tranio,
1 2929     That fac'd and brav'd me in this matter so?
1 2930   BAPTISTA. Why, tell me, is not this my Cambio?
1 2931   BIANCA. Cambio is chang'd into Lucentio.
1 2932   LUCENTIO. Love wrought these miracles. Bianca's love
1 2933     Made me exchange my state with Tranio,
1 2934     While he did bear my countenance in the town;
1 2935     And happily I have arrived at the last
1 2936     Unto the wished haven of my bliss.
1 2937     What Tranio did, myself enforc'd him to;
1 2938     Then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake.
1 2939   VINCENTIO. I'll slit the villain's nose that would have sent me
1 2940 to
1 2941     the gaol.
1 2942   BAPTISTA.  [To LUCENTIO]  But do you hear, sir? Have you
1 2943 married my
1 2944     daughter without asking my good will?
1 2945   VINCENTIO. Fear not, Baptista; we will content you, go to; but
1 2946 I
1 2947     will in to be revenged for this villainy.               Exit
1 2948   BAPTISTA. And I to sound the depth of this knavery.       Exit 
1 2949   LUCENTIO. Look not pale, Bianca; thy father will not frown.
1 2950                                       Exeunt LUCENTIO and BIANCA
1 2951   GREMIO. My cake is dough, but I'll in among the rest;
1 2952     Out of hope of all but my share of the feast.           Exit
1 2953   KATHERINA. Husband, let's follow to see the end of this ado.
1 2954   PETRUCHIO. First kiss me, Kate, and we will.
1 2955   KATHERINA. What, in the midst of the street?
1 2956   PETRUCHIO. What, art thou asham'd of me?
1 2957   KATHERINA. No, sir; God forbid; but asham'd to kiss.
1 2958   PETRUCHIO. Why, then, let's home again. Come, sirrah, let's
1 2959 away.
1 2960   KATHERINA. Nay, I will give thee a kiss; now pray thee, love,
1 2961 stay.
1 2962   PETRUCHIO. Is not this well? Come, my sweet Kate:
1 2963     Better once than never, for never too late.           Exeunt
1 2964 
1 2965 
1 2966 
1 2967 
1 2968 SCENE II.
1 2969 LUCENTIO'S house
1 2970 
1 2971 Enter BAPTISTA, VINCENTIO, GREMIO, the PEDANT, LUCENTIO, BIANCA,
1 2972 PETRUCHIO, KATHERINA, HORTENSIO, and WIDOW. The SERVINGMEN with
1 2973 TRANIO,
1 2974 BIONDELLO, and GRUMIO, bringing in a banquet
1 2975 
1 2976   LUCENTIO. At last, though long, our jarring notes agree;
1 2977     And time it is when raging war is done
1 2978     To smile at scapes and perils overblown.
1 2979     My fair Bianca, bid my father welcome,
1 2980     While I with self-same kindness welcome thine.
1 2981     Brother Petruchio, sister Katherina,
1 2982     And thou, Hortensio, with thy loving widow,
1 2983     Feast with the best, and welcome to my house.
1 2984     My banquet is to close our stomachs up
1 2985     After our great good cheer. Pray you, sit down;
1 2986     For now we sit to chat as well as eat.            [They sit]
1 2987   PETRUCHIO. Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!
1 2988   BAPTISTA. Padua affords this kindness, son Petruchio.
1 2989   PETRUCHIO. Padua affords nothing but what is kind. 
1 2990   HORTENSIO. For both our sakes I would that word were true.
1 2991   PETRUCHIO. Now, for my life, Hortensio fears his widow.
1 2992   WIDOW. Then never trust me if I be afeard.
1 2993   PETRUCHIO. YOU are very sensible, and yet you miss my sense:
1 2994     I mean Hortensio is afeard of you.
1 2995   WIDOW. He that is giddy thinks the world turns round.
1 2996   PETRUCHIO. Roundly replied.
1 2997   KATHERINA. Mistress, how mean you that?
1 2998   WIDOW. Thus I conceive by him.
1 2999   PETRUCHIO. Conceives by me! How likes Hortensio that?
1 3000   HORTENSIO. My widow says thus she conceives her tale.
1 3001   PETRUCHIO. Very well mended. Kiss him for that, good widow.
1 3002   KATHERINA. 'He that is giddy thinks the world turns round.'
1 3003     I pray you tell me what you meant by that.
1 3004   WIDOW. Your husband, being troubled with a shrew,
1 3005     Measures my husband's sorrow by his woe;
1 3006     And now you know my meaning.
1 3007   KATHERINA. A very mean meaning.
1 3008   WIDOW. Right, I mean you.
1 3009   KATHERINA. And I am mean, indeed, respecting you. 
1 3010   PETRUCHIO. To her, Kate!
1 3011   HORTENSIO. To her, widow!
1 3012   PETRUCHIO. A hundred marks, my Kate does put her down.
1 3013   HORTENSIO. That's my office.
1 3014   PETRUCHIO. Spoke like an officer- ha' to thee, lad.
1 3015                                            [Drinks to HORTENSIO]
1 3016   BAPTISTA. How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?
1 3017   GREMIO. Believe me, sir, they butt together well.
1 3018   BIANCA. Head and butt! An hasty-witted body
1 3019     Would say your head and butt were head and horn.
1 3020   VINCENTIO. Ay, mistress bride, hath that awakened you?
1 3021   BIANCA. Ay, but not frighted me; therefore I'll sleep again.
1 3022   PETRUCHIO. Nay, that you shall not; since you have begun,
1 3023     Have at you for a bitter jest or two.
1 3024   BIANCA. Am I your bird? I mean to shift my bush,
1 3025     And then pursue me as you draw your bow.
1 3026     You are welcome all.
1 3027                              Exeunt BIANCA, KATHERINA, and WIDOW
1 3028   PETRUCHIO. She hath prevented me. Here, Signior Tranio,
1 3029     This bird you aim'd at, though you hit her not; 
1 3030     Therefore a health to all that shot and miss'd.
1 3031   TRANIO. O, sir, Lucentio slipp'd me like his greyhound,
1 3032     Which runs himself, and catches for his master.
1 3033   PETRUCHIO. A good swift simile, but something currish.
1 3034   TRANIO. 'Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself;
1 3035     'Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.
1 3036   BAPTISTA. O, O, Petruchio! Tranio hits you now.
1 3037   LUCENTIO. I thank thee for that gird, good Tranio.
1 3038   HORTENSIO. Confess, confess; hath he not hit you here?
1 3039   PETRUCHIO. 'A has a little gall'd me, I confess;
1 3040     And, as the jest did glance away from me,
1 3041     'Tis ten to one it maim'd you two outright.
1 3042   BAPTISTA. Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio,
1 3043     I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.
1 3044   PETRUCHIO. Well, I say no; and therefore, for assurance,
1 3045     Let's each one send unto his wife,
1 3046     And he whose wife is most obedient,
1 3047     To come at first when he doth send for her,
1 3048     Shall win the wager which we will propose.
1 3049   HORTENSIO. Content. What's the wager? 
1 3050   LUCENTIO. Twenty crowns.
1 3051   PETRUCHIO. Twenty crowns?
1 3052     I'll venture so much of my hawk or hound,
1 3053     But twenty times so much upon my wife.
1 3054   LUCENTIO. A hundred then.
1 3055   HORTENSIO. Content.
1 3056   PETRUCHIO. A match! 'tis done.
1 3057   HORTENSIO. Who shall begin?
1 3058   LUCENTIO. That will I.
1 3059     Go, Biondello, bid your mistress come to me.
1 3060   BIONDELLO. I go.                                          Exit
1 3061   BAPTISTA. Son, I'll be your half Bianca comes.
1 3062   LUCENTIO. I'll have no halves; I'll bear it all myself.
1 3063 
1 3064                           Re-enter BIONDELLO
1 3065 
1 3066     How now! what news?
1 3067   BIONDELLO. Sir, my mistress sends you word
1 3068     That she is busy and she cannot come.
1 3069   PETRUCHIO. How! She's busy, and she cannot come! 
1 3070     Is that an answer?
1 3071   GREMIO. Ay, and a kind one too.
1 3072     Pray God, sir, your wife send you not a worse.
1 3073   PETRUCHIO. I hope better.
1 3074   HORTENSIO. Sirrah Biondello, go and entreat my wife
1 3075     To come to me forthwith.                      Exit BIONDELLO
1 3076   PETRUCHIO. O, ho! entreat her!
1 3077     Nay, then she must needs come.
1 3078   HORTENSIO. I am afraid, sir,
1 3079     Do what you can, yours will not be entreated.
1 3080 
1 3081                             Re-enter BIONDELLO
1 3082 
1 3083     Now, where's my wife?
1 3084   BIONDELLO. She says you have some goodly jest in hand:
1 3085     She will not come; she bids you come to her.
1 3086   PETRUCHIO. Worse and worse; she will not come! O vile,
1 3087     Intolerable, not to be endur'd!
1 3088     Sirrah Grumio, go to your mistress;
1 3089     Say I command her come to me.                    Exit GRUMIO 
1 3090   HORTENSIO. I know her answer.
1 3091   PETRUCHIO. What?
1 3092   HORTENSIO. She will not.
1 3093   PETRUCHIO. The fouler fortune mine, and there an end.
1 3094 
1 3095                              Re-enter KATHERINA
1 3096 
1 3097   BAPTISTA. Now, by my holidame, here comes Katherina!
1 3098   KATHERINA. What is your will, sir, that you send for me?
1 3099   PETRUCHIO. Where is your sister, and Hortensio's wife?
1 3100   KATHERINA. They sit conferring by the parlour fire.
1 3101   PETRUCHIO. Go, fetch them hither; if they deny to come.
1 3102     Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands.
1 3103     Away, I say, and bring them hither straight.
1 3104                                                   Exit KATHERINA
1 3105   LUCENTIO. Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder.
1 3106   HORTENSIO. And so it is. I wonder what it bodes.
1 3107   PETRUCHIO. Marry, peace it bodes, and love, and quiet life,
1 3108     An awful rule, and right supremacy;
1 3109     And, to be short, what not that's sweet and happy. 
1 3110   BAPTISTA. Now fair befall thee, good Petruchio!
1 3111     The wager thou hast won; and I will ad
1 3112     Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;
1 3113     Another dowry to another daughter,
1 3114     For she is chang'd, as she had never been.
1 3115   PETRUCHIO. Nay, I will win my wager better yet,
1 3116     And show more sign of her obedience,
1 3117     Her new-built virtue and obedience.
1 3118 
1 3119                  Re-enter KATHERINA with BIANCA and WIDOW
1 3120 
1 3121     See where she comes, and brings your froward wives
1 3122     As prisoners to her womanly persuasion.
1 3123     Katherine, that cap of yours becomes you not:
1 3124     Off with that bauble, throw it underfoot.
1 3125                                             [KATHERINA complies]
1 3126   WIDOW. Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh
1 3127     Till I be brought to such a silly pass!
1 3128   BIANCA. Fie! what a foolish duty call you this?
1 3129   LUCENTIO. I would your duty were as foolish too; 
1 3130     The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca,
1 3131     Hath cost me a hundred crowns since supper-time!
1 3132   BIANCA. The more fool you for laying on my duty.
1 3133   PETRUCHIO. Katherine, I charge thee, tell these headstrong
1 3134 women
1 3135     What duty they do owe their lords and husbands.
1 3136   WIDOW. Come, come, you're mocking; we will have no telling.
1 3137   PETRUCHIO. Come on, I say; and first begin with her.
1 3138   WIDOW. She shall not.
1 3139   PETRUCHIO. I say she shall. And first begin with her.
1 3140   KATHERINA. Fie, fie! unknit that threatening unkind brow,
1 3141     And dart not scornful glances from those eyes
1 3142     To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor.
1 3143     It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,
1 3144     Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,
1 3145     And in no sense is meet or amiable.
1 3146     A woman mov'd is like a fountain troubled-
1 3147     Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty;
1 3148     And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty
1 3149     Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.
1 3150     Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper, 
1 3151     Thy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee,
1 3152     And for thy maintenance commits his body
1 3153     To painful labour both by sea and land,
1 3154     To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,
1 3155     Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe;
1 3156     And craves no other tribute at thy hands
1 3157     But love, fair looks, and true obedience-
1 3158     Too little payment for so great a debt.
1 3159     Such duty as the subject owes the prince,
1 3160     Even such a woman oweth to her husband;
1 3161     And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,
1 3162     And not obedient to his honest will,
1 3163     What is she but a foul contending rebel
1 3164     And graceless traitor to her loving lord?
1 3165     I am asham'd that women are so simple
1 3166     To offer war where they should kneel for peace;
1 3167     Or seek for rule, supremacy, and sway,
1 3168     When they are bound to serve, love, and obey.
1 3169     Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,
1 3170     Unapt to toll and trouble in the world, 
1 3171     But that our soft conditions and our hearts
1 3172     Should well agree with our external parts?
1 3173     Come, come, you froward and unable worins!
1 3174     My mind hath been as big as one of yours,
1 3175     My heart as great, my reason haply more,
1 3176     To bandy word for word and frown for frown;
1 3177     But now I see our lances are but straws,
1 3178     Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,
1 3179     That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.
1 3180     Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,
1 3181     And place your hands below your husband's foot;
1 3182     In token of which duty, if he please,
1 3183     My hand is ready, may it do him ease.
1 3184   PETRUCHIO. Why, there's a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate.
1 3185   LUCENTIO. Well, go thy ways, old lad, for thou shalt ha't.
1 3186   VINCENTIO. 'Tis a good hearing when children are toward.
1 3187   LUCENTIO. But a harsh hearing when women are froward.
1 3188   PETRUCHIO. Come, Kate, we'll to bed.
1 3189     We three are married, but you two are sped.
1 3190     [To LUCENTIO]  'Twas I won the wager, though you hit the
1 3191 white; 
1 3192     And being a winner, God give you good night!
1 3193                                   Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHERINA
1 3194   HORTENSIO. Now go thy ways; thou hast tam'd a curst shrow.
1 3195   LUCENTIO. 'Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tam'd so.
1 3196                                                           Exeunt
