8 9   From fairest creatures we desire increase,
8 10   That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
8 11   But as the riper should by time decease,
8 12   His tender heir might bear his memory:
8 13   But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,
8 14   Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,
8 15   Making a famine where abundance lies,
8 16   Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:
8 17   Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,
8 18   And only herald to the gaudy spring,
8 19   Within thine own bud buriest thy content,
8 20   And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:
8 21     Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
8 22     To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.
8 23 
8 24   II
8 25 
8 26   When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,
8 27   And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,
8 28   Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now,
8 29   Will be a tatter'd weed of small worth held:
8 30   Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,
8 31   Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;
8 32   To say, within thine own deep sunken eyes,
8 33   Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.
8 34   How much more praise deserv'd thy beauty's use,
8 35   If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine
8 36   Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse,'
8 37   Proving his beauty by succession thine!
8 38     This were to be new made when thou art old,
8 39     And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.
8 40 
8 41   III
8 42 
8 43   Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest
8 44   Now is the time that face should form another;
8 45   Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,
8 46   Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.
8 47   For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb
8 48   Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?
8 49   Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,
8 50   Of his self-love to stop posterity?
8 51   Thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee
8 52   Calls back the lovely April of her prime;
8 53   So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,
8 54   Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.
8 55     But if thou live, remember'd not to be,
8 56     Die single and thine image dies with thee.
8 57 
8 58   IV
8 59 
8 60   Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend
8 61   Upon thy self thy beauty's legacy?
8 62   Nature's bequest gives nothing, but doth lend,
8 63   And being frank she lends to those are free:
8 64   Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse
8 65   The bounteous largess given thee to give?
8 66   Profitless usurer, why dost thou use
8 67   So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?
8 68   For having traffic with thy self alone,
8 69   Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive:
8 70   Then how when nature calls thee to be gone,
8 71   What acceptable audit canst thou leave?
8 72     Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,
8 73     Which, used, lives th' executor to be.
8 74 
8 75   V
8 76 
8 77   Those hours, that with gentle work did frame
8 78   The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,
8 79   Will play the tyrants to the very same
8 80   And that unfair which fairly doth excel;
8 81   For never-resting time leads summer on
8 82   To hideous winter, and confounds him there;
8 83   Sap checked with frost, and lusty leaves quite gone,
8 84   Beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where:
8 85   Then were not summer's distillation left,
8 86   A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,
8 87   Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,
8 88   Nor it, nor no remembrance what it was:
8 89     But flowers distill'd, though they with winter meet,
8 90     Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.
8 91 
8 92 
8 93   VI
8 94 
8 95   Then let not winter's ragged hand deface,
8 96   In thee thy summer, ere thou be distill'd:
8 97   Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place
8 98   With beauty's treasure ere it be self-kill'd.
8 99   That use is not forbidden usury,
8 100   Which happies those that pay the willing loan;
8 101   That's for thy self to breed another thee,
8 102   Or ten times happier, be it ten for one;
8 103   Ten times thy self were happier than thou art,
8 104   If ten of thine ten times refigur'd thee:
8 105   Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,
8 106   Leaving thee living in posterity?
8 107     Be not self-will'd, for thou art much too fair
8 108     To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.
8 109 
8 110   VII
8 111 
8 112   Lo! in the orient when the gracious light
8 113   Lifts up his burning head, each under eye
8 114   Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,
8 115   Serving with looks his sacred majesty;
8 116   And having climb'd the steep-up heavenly hill,
8 117   Resembling strong youth in his middle age,
8 118   Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,
8 119   Attending on his golden pilgrimage:
8 120   But when from highmost pitch, with weary car,
8 121   Like feeble age, he reeleth from the day,
8 122   The eyes, 'fore duteous, now converted are
8 123   From his low tract, and look another way:
8 124     So thou, thyself outgoing in thy noon:
8 125     Unlook'd, on diest unless thou get a son.
8 126 
8 127   VIII
8 128 
8 129   Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?
8 130   Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:
8 131   Why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly,
8 132   Or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy?
8 133   If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,
8 134   By unions married, do offend thine ear,
8 135   They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds
8 136   In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear.
8 137   Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,
8 138   Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;
8 139   Resembling sire and child and happy mother,
8 140   Who, all in one, one pleasing note do sing:
8 141     Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,
8 142     Sings this to thee: 'Thou single wilt prove none.'
8 143 
8 144   IX
8 145 
8 146   Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye,
8 147   That thou consum'st thy self in single life?
8 148   Ah! if thou issueless shalt hap to die,
8 149   The world will wail thee like a makeless wife;
8 150   The world will be thy widow and still weep
8 151   That thou no form of thee hast left behind,
8 152   When every private widow well may keep
8 153   By children's eyes, her husband's shape in mind:
8 154   Look! what an unthrift in the world doth spend
8 155   Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;
8 156   But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,
8 157   And kept unused the user so destroys it.
8 158     No love toward others in that bosom sits
8 159     That on himself such murd'rous shame commits.
8 160 
8 161   X
8 162 
8 163   For shame! deny that thou bear'st love to any,
8 164   Who for thy self art so unprovident.
8 165   Grant, if thou wilt, thou art belov'd of many,
8 166   But that thou none lov'st is most evident:
8 167   For thou art so possess'd with murderous hate,
8 168   That 'gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire,
8 169   Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
8 170   Which to repair should be thy chief desire.
8 171   O! change thy thought, that I may change my mind:
8 172   Shall hate be fairer lodg'd than gentle love?
8 173   Be, as thy presence is, gracious and kind,
8 174   Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:
8 175     Make thee another self for love of me,
8 176     That beauty still may live in thine or thee.
8 177 
8 178   XI
8 179 
8 180   As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou grow'st,
8 181   In one of thine, from that which thou departest;
8 182   And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st,
8 183   Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest,
8 184   Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase;
8 185   Without this folly, age, and cold decay:
8 186   If all were minded so, the times should cease
8 187   And threescore year would make the world away.
8 188   Let those whom nature hath not made for store,
8 189   Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:
8 190   Look, whom she best endow'd, she gave thee more;
8 191   Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:
8 192     She carv'd thee for her seal, and meant thereby,
8 193     Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.
8 194 
8 195   XII
8 196 
8 197   When I do count the clock that tells the time,
8 198   And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;
8 199   When I behold the violet past prime,
8 200   And sable curls, all silvered o'er with white;
8 201   When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,
8 202   Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,
8 203   And summer's green all girded up in sheaves,
8 204   Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard,
8 205   Then of thy beauty do I question make,
8 206   That thou among the wastes of time must go,
8 207   Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
8 208   And die as fast as they see others grow;
8 209     And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence
8 210     Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.
8 211 
8 212   XIII
8 213 
8 214   O! that you were your self; but, love you are
8 215   No longer yours, than you your self here live:
8 216   Against this coming end you should prepare,
8 217   And your sweet semblance to some other give:
8 218   So should that beauty which you hold in lease
8 219   Find no determination; then you were
8 220   Yourself again, after yourself's decease,
8 221   When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.
8 222   Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,
8 223   Which husbandry in honour might uphold,
8 224   Against the stormy gusts of winter's day
8 225   And barren rage of death's eternal cold?
8 226     O! none but unthrifts. Dear my love, you know,
8 227     You had a father: let your son say so.
8 228 
8 229   XIV
8 230 
8 231   Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck;
8 232   And yet methinks I have astronomy,
8 233   But not to tell of good or evil luck,
8 234   Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality;
8 235   Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,
8 236   Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,
8 237   Or say with princes if it shall go well
8 238   By oft predict that I in heaven find:
8 239   But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,
8 240   And constant stars in them I read such art
8 241   As 'Truth and beauty shall together thrive,
8 242   If from thyself, to store thou wouldst convert';
8 243     Or else of thee this I prognosticate:
8 244     'Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.'
8 245 
8 246   XV
8 247 
8 248   When I consider every thing that grows
8 249   Holds in perfection but a little moment,
8 250   That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
8 251   Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;
8 252   When I perceive that men as plants increase,
8 253   Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky,
8 254   Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
8 255   And wear their brave state out of memory;
8 256   Then the conceit of this inconstant stay
8 257   Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,
8 258   Where wasteful Time debateth with decay
8 259   To change your day of youth to sullied night,
8 260     And all in war with Time for love of you,
8 261     As he takes from you, I engraft you new.
8 262 
8 263   XVI
8 264 
8 265   But wherefore do not you a mightier way
8 266   Make war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?
8 267   And fortify your self in your decay
8 268   With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?
8 269   Now stand you on the top of happy hours,
8 270   And many maiden gardens, yet unset,
8 271   With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,
8 272   Much liker than your painted counterfeit:
8 273   So should the lines of life that life repair,
8 274   Which this, Time's pencil, or my pupil pen,
8 275   Neither in inward worth nor outward fair,
8 276   Can make you live your self in eyes of men.
8 277     To give away yourself, keeps yourself still,
8 278     And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill.
8 279 
8 280   XVII
8 281 
8 282   Who will believe my verse in time to come,
8 283   If it were fill'd with your most high deserts?
8 284   Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb
8 285   Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts.
8 286   If I could write the beauty of your eyes,
8 287   And in fresh numbers number all your graces,
8 288   The age to come would say 'This poet lies;
8 289   Such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces.'
8 290   So should my papers, yellow'd with their age,
8 291   Be scorn'd, like old men of less truth than tongue,
8 292   And your true rights be term'd a poet's rage
8 293   And stretched metre of an antique song:
8 294     But were some child of yours alive that time,
8 295     You should live twice,--in it, and in my rhyme.
8 296 
8 297   XVIII
8 298 
8 299   Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
8 300   Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
8 301   Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
8 302   And summer's lease hath all too short a date:
8 303   Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
8 304   And often is his gold complexion dimm'd,
8 305   And every fair from fair sometime declines,
8 306   By chance, or nature's changing course untrimm'd:
8 307   But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
8 308   Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,
8 309   Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,
8 310   When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,
8 311     So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
8 312     So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
8 313 
8 314   XIX
8 315 
8 316   Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion's paws,
8 317   And make the earth devour her own sweet brood;
8 318   Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,
8 319   And burn the long-liv'd phoenix, in her blood;
8 320   Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets,
8 321   And do whate'er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,
8 322   To the wide world and all her fading sweets;
8 323   But I forbid thee one most heinous crime:
8 324   O! carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,
8 325   Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;
8 326   Him in thy course untainted do allow
8 327   For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.
8 328     Yet, do thy worst old Time: despite thy wrong,
8 329     My love shall in my verse ever live young.
8 330 
8 331   XX
8 332 
8 333   A woman's face with nature's own hand painted,
8 334   Hast thou, the master mistress of my passion;
8 335   A woman's gentle heart, but not acquainted
8 336   With shifting change, as is false women's fashion:
8 337   An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,
8 338   Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;
8 339   A man in hue all 'hues' in his controlling,
8 340   Which steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.
8 341   And for a woman wert thou first created;
8 342   Till Nature, as she wrought thee, fell a-doting,
8 343   And by addition me of thee defeated,
8 344   By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.
8 345     But since she prick'd thee out for women's pleasure,
8 346     Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.
8 347 
8 348   XXI
8 349 
8 350   So is it not with me as with that Muse,
8 351   Stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse,
8 352   Who heaven itself for ornament doth use
8 353   And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,
8 354   Making a couplement of proud compare'
8 355   With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems,
8 356   With April's first-born flowers, and all things rare,
8 357   That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.
8 358   O! let me, true in love, but truly write,
8 359   And then believe me, my love is as fair
8 360   As any mother's child, though not so bright
8 361   As those gold candles fix'd in heaven's air:
8 362     Let them say more that like of hearsay well;
8 363     I will not praise that purpose not to sell.
8 364 
8 365   XXII
8 366 
8 367   My glass shall not persuade me I am old,
8 368   So long as youth and thou are of one date;
8 369   But when in thee time's furrows I behold,
8 370   Then look I death my days should expiate.
8 371   For all that beauty that doth cover thee,
8 372   Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,
8 373   Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me:
8 374   How can I then be elder than thou art?
8 375   O! therefore love, be of thyself so wary
8 376   As I, not for myself, but for thee will;
8 377   Bearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary
8 378   As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.
8 379     Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain,
8 380     Thou gav'st me thine not to give back again.
8 381 
8 382   XXIII
8 383 
8 384   As an unperfect actor on the stage,
8 385   Who with his fear is put beside his part,
8 386   Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,
8 387   Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart;
8 388   So I, for fear of trust, forget to say
8 389   The perfect ceremony of love's rite,
8 390   And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,
8 391   O'ercharg'd with burthen of mine own love's might.
8 392   O! let my looks be then the eloquence
8 393   And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,
8 394   Who plead for love, and look for recompense,
8 395   More than that tongue that more hath more express'd.
8 396     O! learn to read what silent love hath writ:
8 397     To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.
8 398 
8 399   XXIV
8 400 
8 401   Mine eye hath play'd the painter and hath stell'd,
8 402   Thy beauty's form in table of my heart;
8 403   My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,
8 404   And perspective it is best painter's art.
8 405   For through the painter must you see his skill,
8 406   To find where your true image pictur'd lies,
8 407   Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,
8 408   That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes.
8 409   Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:
8 410   Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me
8 411   Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun
8 412   Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;
8 413     Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,
8 414     They draw but what they see, know not the heart.
8 415 
8 416   XXV
8 417 
8 418   Let those who are in favour with their stars
8 419   Of public honour and proud titles boast,
8 420   Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars
8 421   Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.
8 422   Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread
8 423   But as the marigold at the sun's eye,
8 424   And in themselves their pride lies buried,
8 425   For at a frown they in their glory die.
8 426   The painful warrior famoused for fight,
8 427   After a thousand victories once foil'd,
8 428   Is from the book of honour razed quite,
8 429   And all the rest forgot for which he toil'd:
8 430   Then happy I, that love and am belov'd,
8 431   Where I may not remove nor be remov'd.
8 432 
8 433   XXVI
8 434 
8 435   Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage
8 436   Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit,
8 437   To thee I send this written embassage,
8 438   To witness duty, not to show my wit:
8 439   Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine
8 440   May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it,
8 441   But that I hope some good conceit of thine
8 442   In thy soul's thought, all naked, will bestow it:
8 443   Till whatsoever star that guides my moving,
8 444   Points on me graciously with fair aspect,
8 445   And puts apparel on my tatter'd loving,
8 446   To show me worthy of thy sweet respect:
8 447     Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee;
8 448     Till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me.
8 449 
8 450   XXVII
8 451 
8 452   Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,
8 453   The dear respose for limbs with travel tir'd;
8 454   But then begins a journey in my head
8 455   To work my mind, when body's work's expired:
8 456   For then my thoughts--from far where I abide--
8 457   Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,
8 458   And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,
8 459   Looking on darkness which the blind do see:
8 460   Save that my soul's imaginary sight
8 461   Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,
8 462   Which, like a jewel (hung in ghastly night,
8 463   Makes black night beauteous, and her old face new.
8 464     Lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,
8 465     For thee, and for myself, no quiet find.
8 466 
8 467   XXVIII
8 468 
8 469   How can I then return in happy plight,
8 470   That am debarre'd the benefit of rest?
8 471   When day's oppression is not eas'd by night,
8 472   But day by night and night by day oppress'd,
8 473   And each, though enemies to either's reign,
8 474   Do in consent shake hands to torture me,
8 475   The one by toil, the other to complain
8 476   How far I toil, still farther off from thee.
8 477   I tell the day, to please him thou art bright,
8 478   And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:
8 479   So flatter I the swart-complexion'd night,
8 480   When sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even.
8 481     But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer,
8 482     And night doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger.
8 483 
8 484   XXIX
8 485 
8 486   When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes
8 487   I all alone beweep my outcast state,
8 488   And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,
8 489   And look upon myself, and curse my fate,
8 490   Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,
8 491   Featur'd like him, like him with friends possess'd,
8 492   Desiring this man's art, and that man's scope,
8 493   With what I most enjoy contented least;
8 494   Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising,
8 495   Haply I think on thee,-- and then my state,
8 496   Like to the lark at break of day arising
8 497   From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;
8 498     For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings
8 499     That then I scorn to change my state with kings.
8 500 
8 501   XXX
8 502 
8 503   When to the sessions of sweet silent thought
8 504   I summon up remembrance of things past,
8 505   I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,
8 506   And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:
8 507   Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow,
8 508   For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,
8 509   And weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe,
8 510   And moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight:
8 511   Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,
8 512   And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
8 513   The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,
8 514   Which I new pay as if not paid before.
8 515     But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,
8 516     All losses are restor'd and sorrows end.
8 517 
8 518   XXXI
8 519 
8 520   Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,
8 521   Which I by lacking have supposed dead;
8 522   And there reigns Love, and all Love's loving parts,
8 523   And all those friends which I thought buried.
8 524   How many a holy and obsequious tear
8 525   Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye,
8 526   As interest of the dead, which now appear
8 527   But things remov'd that hidden in thee lie!
8 528   Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,
8 529   Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,
8 530   Who all their parts of me to thee did give,
8 531   That due of many now is thine alone:
8 532     Their images I lov'd, I view in thee,
8 533     And thou--all they--hast all the all of me.
8 534 
8 535   XXXII
8 536 
8 537   If thou survive my well-contented day,
8 538   When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover
8 539   And shalt by fortune once more re-survey
8 540   These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover,
8 541   Compare them with the bett'ring of the time,
8 542   And though they be outstripp'd by every pen,
8 543   Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
8 544   Exceeded by the height of happier men.
8 545   O! then vouchsafe me but this loving thought:
8 546   'Had my friend's Muse grown with this growing age,
8 547   A dearer birth than this his love had brought,
8 548   To march in ranks of better equipage:
8 549     But since he died and poets better prove,
8 550     Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love'.
8 551 
8 552   XXXIII
8 553 
8 554   Full many a glorious morning have I seen
8 555   Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,
8 556   Kissing with golden face the meadows green,
8 557   Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;
8 558   Anon permit the basest clouds to ride
8 559   With ugly rack on his celestial face,
8 560   And from the forlorn world his visage hide,
8 561   Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:
8 562   Even so my sun one early morn did shine,
8 563   With all triumphant splendour on my brow;
8 564   But out! alack! he was but one hour mine,
8 565   The region cloud hath mask'd him from me now.
8 566     Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;
8 567     Suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth.
8 568 
8 569   XXXIV
8 570 
8 571   Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,
8 572   And make me travel forth without my cloak,
8 573   To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way,
8 574   Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke?
8 575   'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,
8 576   To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,
8 577   For no man well of such a salve can speak,
8 578   That heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace:
8 579   Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief;
8 580   Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss:
8 581   The offender's sorrow lends but weak relief
8 582   To him that bears the strong offence's cross.
8 583     Ah! but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,
8 584     And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds.
8 585 
8 586   XXXV
8 587 
8 588   No more be griev'd at that which thou hast done:
8 589   Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud:
8 590   Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,
8 591   And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.
8 592   All men make faults, and even I in this,
8 593   Authorizing thy trespass with compare,
8 594   Myself corrupting, salving thy amiss,
8 595   Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
8 596   For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense,--
8 597   Thy adverse party is thy advocate,--
8 598   And 'gainst myself a lawful plea commence:
8 599   Such civil war is in my love and hate,
8 600     That I an accessary needs must be,
8 601     To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.
8 602 
8 603   XXXVI
8 604 
8 605   Let me confess that we two must be twain,
8 606   Although our undivided loves are one:
8 607   So shall those blots that do with me remain,
8 608   Without thy help, by me be borne alone.
8 609   In our two loves there is but one respect,
8 610   Though in our lives a separable spite,
8 611   Which though it alter not love's sole effect,
8 612   Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight.
8 613   I may not evermore acknowledge thee,
8 614   Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,
8 615   Nor thou with public kindness honour me,
8 616   Unless thou take that honour from thy name:
8 617     But do not so, I love thee in such sort,
8 618     As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.
8 619 
8 620   XXXVII
8 621 
8 622   As a decrepit father takes delight
8 623   To see his active child do deeds of youth,
8 624   So I, made lame by Fortune's dearest spite,
8 625   Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth;
8 626   For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,
8 627   Or any of these all, or all, or more,
8 628   Entitled in thy parts, do crowned sit,
8 629   I make my love engrafted, to this store:
8 630   So then I am not lame, poor, nor despis'd,
8 631   Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give
8 632   That I in thy abundance am suffic'd,
8 633   And by a part of all thy glory live.
8 634     Look what is best, that best I wish in thee:
8 635     This wish I have; then ten times happy me!
8 636 
8 637   XXXVIII
8 638 
8 639   How can my muse want subject to invent,
8 640   While thou dost breathe, that pour'st into my verse
8 641   Thine own sweet argument, too excellent
8 642   For every vulgar paper to rehearse?
8 643   O! give thy self the thanks, if aught in me
8 644   Worthy perusal stand against thy sight;
8 645   For who's so dumb that cannot write to thee,
8 646   When thou thy self dost give invention light?
8 647   Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth
8 648   Than those old nine which rhymers invocate;
8 649   And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth
8 650   Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
8 651     If my slight muse do please these curious days,
8 652     The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.
8 653 
8 654   XXXIX
8 655 
8 656   O! how thy worth with manners may I sing,
8 657   When thou art all the better part of me?
8 658   What can mine own praise to mine own self bring?
8 659   And what is't but mine own when I praise thee?
8 660   Even for this, let us divided live,
8 661   And our dear love lose name of single one,
8 662   That by this separation I may give
8 663   That due to thee which thou deserv'st alone.
8 664   O absence! what a torment wouldst thou prove,
8 665   Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave,
8 666   To entertain the time with thoughts of love,
8 667   Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive,
8 668     And that thou teachest how to make one twain,
8 669     By praising him here who doth hence remain.
8 670 
8 671   XL
8 672 
8 673   Take all my loves, my love, yea take them all;
8 674   What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?
8 675   No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call;
8 676   All mine was thine, before thou hadst this more.
8 677   Then, if for my love, thou my love receivest,
8 678   I cannot blame thee, for my love thou usest;
8 679   But yet be blam'd, if thou thy self deceivest
8 680   By wilful taste of what thyself refusest.
8 681   I do forgive thy robbery, gentle thief,
8 682   Although thou steal thee all my poverty:
8 683   And yet, love knows it is a greater grief
8 684   To bear love's wrong, than hate's known injury.
8 685     Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,
8 686     Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes.
8 687 
8 688   XLI
8 689 
8 690   Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits,
8 691   When I am sometime absent from thy heart,
8 692   Thy beauty, and thy years full well befits,
8 693   For still temptation follows where thou art.
8 694   Gentle thou art, and therefore to be won,
8 695   Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assail'd;
8 696   And when a woman woos, what woman's son
8 697   Will sourly leave her till he have prevail'd?
8 698   Ay me! but yet thou mightst my seat forbear,
8 699   And chide thy beauty and thy straying youth,
8 700   Who lead thee in their riot even there
8 701   Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth:--
8 702     Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,
8 703     Thine by thy beauty being false to me.
8 704 
8 705   XLII
8 706 
8 707   That thou hast her it is not all my grief,
8 708   And yet it may be said I loved her dearly;
8 709   That she hath thee is of my wailing chief,
8 710   A loss in love that touches me more nearly.
8 711   Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye:
8 712   Thou dost love her, because thou know'st I love her;
8 713   And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,
8 714   Suffering my friend for my sake to approve her.
8 715   If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain,
8 716   And losing her, my friend hath found that loss;
8 717   Both find each other, and I lose both twain,
8 718   And both for my sake lay on me this cross:
8 719     But here's the joy; my friend and I are one;
8 720     Sweet flattery! then she loves but me alone.
8 721 
8 722   XLIII
8 723 
8 724   When most I wink, then do mine eyes best see,
8 725   For all the day they view things unrespected;
8 726   But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,
8 727   And darkly bright, are bright in dark directed.
8 728   Then thou, whose shadow shadows doth make bright,
8 729   How would thy shadow's form form happy show
8 730   To the clear day with thy much clearer light,
8 731   When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so!
8 732   How would, I say, mine eyes be blessed made
8 733   By looking on thee in the living day,
8 734   When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade
8 735   Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!
8 736     All days are nights to see till I see thee,
8 737     And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.
8 738 
8 739   XLIV
8 740 
8 741   If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,
8 742   Injurious distance should not stop my way;
8 743   For then despite of space I would be brought,
8 744   From limits far remote, where thou dost stay.
8 745   No matter then although my foot did stand
8 746   Upon the farthest earth remov'd from thee;
8 747   For nimble thought can jump both sea and land,
8 748   As soon as think the place where he would be.
8 749   But, ah! thought kills me that I am not thought,
8 750   To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,
8 751   But that so much of earth and water wrought,
8 752   I must attend time's leisure with my moan;
8 753     Receiving nought by elements so slow
8 754     But heavy tears, badges of either's woe.
8 755 
8 756   XLV
8 757 
8 758   The other two, slight air, and purging fire
8 759   Are both with thee, wherever I abide;
8 760   The first my thought, the other my desire,
8 761   These present-absent with swift motion slide.
8 762   For when these quicker elements are gone
8 763   In tender embassy of love to thee,
8 764   My life, being made of four, with two alone
8 765   Sinks down to death, oppress'd with melancholy;
8 766   Until life's composition be recur'd
8 767   By those swift messengers return'd from thee,
8 768   Who even but now come back again, assur'd,
8 769   Of thy fair health, recounting it to me:
8 770     This told, I joy; but then no longer glad,
8 771     I send them back again, and straight grow sad.
8 772 
8 773   XLVI
8 774 
8 775   Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war,
8 776   How to divide the conquest of thy sight;
8 777   Mine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar,
8 778   My heart mine eye the freedom of that right.
8 779   My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie,--
8 780   A closet never pierc'd with crystal eyes--
8 781   But the defendant doth that plea deny,
8 782   And says in him thy fair appearance lies.
8 783   To side this title is impannelled
8 784   A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart;
8 785   And by their verdict is determined
8 786   The clear eye's moiety, and the dear heart's part:
8 787     As thus; mine eye's due is thy outward part,
8 788     And my heart's right, thy inward love of heart.
8 789 
8 790   XLVII
8 791 
8 792   Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,
8 793   And each doth good turns now unto the other:
8 794   When that mine eye is famish'd for a look,
8 795   Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother,
8 796   With my love's picture then my eye doth feast,
8 797   And to the painted banquet bids my heart;
8 798   Another time mine eye is my heart's guest,
8 799   And in his thoughts of love doth share a part:
8 800   So, either by thy picture or my love,
8 801   Thy self away, art present still with me;
8 802   For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,
8 803   And I am still with them, and they with thee;
8 804     Or, if they sleep, thy picture in my sight
8 805     Awakes my heart, to heart's and eye's delight.
8 806 
8 807   XLVIII
8 808 
8 809   How careful was I when I took my way,
8 810   Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
8 811   That to my use it might unused stay
8 812   From hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!
8 813   But thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,
8 814   Most worthy comfort, now my greatest grief,
8 815   Thou best of dearest, and mine only care,
8 816   Art left the prey of every vulgar thief.
8 817   Thee have I not lock'd up in any chest,
8 818   Save where thou art not, though I feel thou art,
8 819   Within the gentle closure of my breast,
8 820   From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part;
8 821     And even thence thou wilt be stol'n I fear,
8 822     For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.
8 823 
8 824   XLIX
8 825 
8 826   Against that time, if ever that time come,
8 827   When I shall see thee frown on my defects,
8 828   When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,
8 829   Call'd to that audit by advis'd respects;
8 830   Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass,
8 831   And scarcely greet me with that sun, thine eye,
8 832   When love, converted from the thing it was,
8 833   Shall reasons find of settled gravity;
8 834   Against that time do I ensconce me here,
8 835   Within the knowledge of mine own desert,
8 836   And this my hand, against my self uprear,
8 837   To guard the lawful reasons on thy part:
8 838     To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws,
8 839     Since why to love I can allege no cause.
8 840 
8 841   L
8 842 
8 843   How heavy do I journey on the way,
8 844   When what I seek, my weary travel's end,
8 845   Doth teach that ease and that repose to say,
8 846   'Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend!'
8 847   The beast that bears me, tired with my woe,
8 848   Plods dully on, to bear that weight in me,
8 849   As if by some instinct the wretch did know
8 850   His rider lov'd not speed, being made from thee:
8 851   The bloody spur cannot provoke him on,
8 852   That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide,
8 853   Which heavily he answers with a groan,
8 854   More sharp to me than spurring to his side;
8 855     For that same groan doth put this in my mind,
8 856     My grief lies onward, and my joy behind.
8 857 
8 858   LI
8 859 
8 860   Thus can my love excuse the slow offence
8 861   Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed:
8 862   From where thou art why should I haste me thence?
8 863   Till I return, of posting is no need.
8 864   O! what excuse will my poor beast then find,
8 865   When swift extremity can seem but slow?
8 866   Then should I spur, though mounted on the wind,
8 867   In winged speed no motion shall I know,
8 868   Then can no horse with my desire keep pace;
8 869   Therefore desire, of perfect'st love being made,
8 870   Shall neigh--no dull flesh--in his fiery race;
8 871   But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade,--
8 872     'Since from thee going, he went wilful-slow,
8 873     Towards thee I'll run, and give him leave to go.'
8 874 
8 875   LII

8 877   So am I as the rich, whose blessed key,
8 878   Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,
8 879   The which he will not every hour survey,
8 880   For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.
8 881   Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,
8 882   Since, seldom coming in that long year set,
8 883   Like stones of worth they thinly placed are,
8 884   Or captain jewels in the carcanet.
8 885   So is the time that keeps you as my chest,
8 886   Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,
8 887   To make some special instant special-blest,
8 888   By new unfolding his imprison'd pride.
8 889     Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope,
8 890     Being had, to triumph; being lacked, to hope.

8 893 
8 894   What is your substance, whereof are you made,
8 895   That millions of strange shadows on you tend?
8 896   Since every one, hath every one, one shade,
8 897   And you but one, can every shadow lend.
8 898   Describe Adonis, and the counterfeit
8 899   Is poorly imitated after you;
8 900   On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set,
8 901   And you in Grecian tires are painted new:
8 902   Speak of the spring, and foison of the year,
8 903   The one doth shadow of your beauty show,
8 904   The other as your bounty doth appear;
8 905   And you in every blessed shape we know.
8 906     In all external grace you have some part,
8 907     But you like none, none you, for constant heart.
8 908 
8 909   LIV
8 910 
8 911   O! how much more doth beauty beauteous seem
8 912   By that sweet ornament which truth doth give.
8 913   The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem
8 914   For that sweet odour, which doth in it live.
8 915   The canker blooms have full as deep a dye
8 916   As the perfumed tincture of the roses.
8 917   Hang on such thorns, and play as wantonly
8 918   When summer's breath their masked buds discloses:
8 919   But, for their virtue only is their show,
8 920   They live unwoo'd, and unrespected fade;
8 921   Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so;
8 922   Of their sweet deaths, are sweetest odours made:
8 923     And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,
8 924     When that shall vade, by verse distills your truth.
8 925 
8 926   LV
8 927 
8 928   Not marble, nor the gilded monuments
8 929   Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme;
8 930   But you shall shine more bright in these contents
8 931   Than unswept stone, besmear'd with sluttish time.
8 932   When wasteful war shall statues overturn,
8 933   And broils root out the work of masonry,
8 934   Nor Mars his sword, nor war's quick fire shall burn
8 935   The living record of your memory.
8 936   'Gainst death, and all-oblivious enmity
8 937   Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room
8 938   Even in the eyes of all posterity
8 939   That wear this world out to the ending doom.
8 940     So, till the judgment that yourself arise,
8 941     You live in this, and dwell in lovers' eyes.
8 942 
8 943   LVI
8 944 
8 945   Sweet love, renew thy force; be it not said
8 946   Thy edge should blunter be than appetite,
8 947   Which but to-day by feeding is allay'd,
8 948   To-morrow sharpened in his former might:
8 949   So, love, be thou, although to-day thou fill
8 950   Thy hungry eyes, even till they wink with fulness,
8 951   To-morrow see again, and do not kill
8 952   The spirit of love, with a perpetual dulness.
8 953   Let this sad interim like the ocean be
8 954   Which parts the shore, where two contracted new
8 955   Come daily to the banks, that when they see
8 956   Return of love, more blest may be the view;
8 957     Or call it winter, which being full of care,
8 958     Makes summer's welcome, thrice more wished, more rare.

8 961 
8 962   Being your slave what should I do but tend,
8 963   Upon the hours, and times of your desire?
8 964   I have no precious time at all to spend;
8 965   Nor services to do, till you require.
8 966   Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour,
8 967   Whilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you,
8 968   Nor think the bitterness of absence sour,
8 969   When you have bid your servant once adieu;
8 970   Nor dare I question with my jealous thought
8 971   Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,
8 972   But, like a sad slave, stay and think of nought
8 973   Save, where you are, how happy you make those.
8 974     So true a fool is love, that in your will,
8 975     Though you do anything, he thinks no ill.
8 976 
8 977   LVIII
8 978 
8 979   That god forbid, that made me first your slave,
8 980   I should in thought control your times of pleasure,
8 981   Or at your hand the account of hours to crave,
8 982   Being your vassal, bound to stay your leisure!
8 983   O! let me suffer, being at your beck,
8 984   The imprison'd absence of your liberty;
8 985   And patience, tame to sufferance, bide each check,
8 986   Without accusing you of injury.
8 987   Be where you list, your charter is so strong
8 988   That you yourself may privilage your time
8 989   To what you will; to you it doth belong
8 990   Yourself to pardon of self-doing crime.
8 991     I am to wait, though waiting so be hell,
8 992     Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well.

8 994   LIX
8 995 
8 996   If there be nothing new, but that which is
8 997   Hath been before, how are our brains beguil'd,
8 998   Which labouring for invention bear amiss
8 999   The second burthen of a former child!
8 1000   O! that record could with a backward look,
8 1001   Even of five hundred courses of the sun,
8 1002   Show me your image in some antique book,
8 1003   Since mind at first in character was done!
8 1004   That I might see what the old world could say
8 1005   To this composed wonder of your frame;
8 1006   Wh'r we are mended, or wh'r better they,
8 1007   Or whether revolution be the same.
8 1008     O! sure I am the wits of former days,
8 1009     To subjects worse have given admiring praise.

8 1011   LX
8 1012 
8 1013   Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,
8 1014   So do our minutes hasten to their end;
8 1015   Each changing place with that which goes before,
8 1016   In sequent toil all forwards do contend.
8 1017   Nativity, once in the main of light,
8 1018   Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crown'd,
8 1019   Crooked eclipses 'gainst his glory fight,
8 1020   And Time that gave doth now his gift confound.
8 1021   Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth
8 1022   And delves the parallels in beauty's brow,
8 1023   Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth,
8 1024   And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow:
8 1025     And yet to times in hope, my verse shall stand.
8 1026     Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.
8 1027 
8 1028   LXI
8 1029 
8 1030   Is it thy will, thy image should keep open
8 1031   My heavy eyelids to the weary night?
8 1032   Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken,
8 1033   While shadows like to thee do mock my sight?
8 1034   Is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee
8 1035   So far from home into my deeds to pry,
8 1036   To find out shames and idle hours in me,
8 1037   The scope and tenure of thy jealousy?
8 1038   O, no! thy love, though much, is not so great:
8 1039   It is my love that keeps mine eye awake:
8 1040   Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat,
8 1041   To play the watchman ever for thy sake:
8 1042     For thee watch I, whilst thou dost wake elsewhere,
8 1043     From me far off, with others all too near.
8 1044 
8 1045   LXII
8 1046 
8 1047   Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye
8 1048   And all my soul, and all my every part;
8 1049   And for this sin there is no remedy,
8 1050   It is so grounded inward in my heart.
8 1051   Methinks no face so gracious is as mine,
8 1052   No shape so true, no truth of such account;
8 1053   And for myself mine own worth do define,
8 1054   As I all other in all worths surmount.
8 1055   But when my glass shows me myself indeed
8 1056   Beated and chopp'd with tanned antiquity,
8 1057   Mine own self-love quite contrary I read;
8 1058   Self so self-loving were iniquity.
8 1059     'Tis thee,--myself,--that for myself I praise,
8 1060     Painting my age with beauty of thy days.
8 1061 
8 1062   LXIII
8 1063 
8 1064   Against my love shall be as I am now,
8 1065   With Time's injurious hand crush'd and o'erworn;
8 1066   When hours have drain'd his blood and fill'd his brow
8 1067   With lines and wrinkles; when his youthful morn
8 1068   Hath travell'd on to age's steepy night;
8 1069   And all those beauties whereof now he's king
8 1070   Are vanishing, or vanished out of sight,
8 1071   Stealing away the treasure of his spring;
8 1072   For such a time do I now fortify
8 1073   Against confounding age's cruel knife,
8 1074   That he shall never cut from memory
8 1075   My sweet love's beauty, though my lover's life:
8 1076     His beauty shall in these black lines be seen,
8 1077     And they shall live, and he in them still green.
8 1078 
8 1079   LXIV
8 1080 
8 1081   When I have seen by Time's fell hand defac'd
8 1082   The rich-proud cost of outworn buried age;
8 1083   When sometime lofty towers I see down-raz'd,
8 1084   And brass eternal slave to mortal rage;
8 1085   When I have seen the hungry ocean gain
8 1086   Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,
8 1087   And the firm soil win of the watery main,
8 1088   Increasing store with loss, and loss with store;
8 1089   When I have seen such interchange of state,
8 1090   Or state itself confounded, to decay;
8 1091   Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate--
8 1092   That Time will come and take my love away.
8 1093     This thought is as a death which cannot choose
8 1094     But weep to have, that which it fears to lose.
8 1095 
8 1096   LXV
8 1097 
8 1098   Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,
8 1099   But sad mortality o'ersways their power,
8 1100   How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,
8 1101   Whose action is no stronger than a flower?
8 1102   O! how shall summer's honey breath hold out,
8 1103   Against the wrackful siege of battering days,
8 1104   When rocks impregnable are not so stout,
8 1105   Nor gates of steel so strong but Time decays?
8 1106   O fearful meditation! where, alack,
8 1107   Shall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid?
8 1108   Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back?
8 1109   Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?
8 1110     O! none, unless this miracle have might,
8 1111     That in black ink my love may still shine bright.
8 1112 
8 1113   LXVI
8 1114 
8 1115   Tired with all these, for restful death I cry,
8 1116   As to behold desert a beggar born,
8 1117   And needy nothing trimm'd in jollity,
8 1118   And purest faith unhappily forsworn,
8 1119   And gilded honour shamefully misplac'd,
8 1120   And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,
8 1121   And right perfection wrongfully disgrac'd,
8 1122   And strength by limping sway disabled
8 1123   And art made tongue-tied by authority,
8 1124   And folly--doctor-like--controlling skill,
8 1125   And simple truth miscall'd simplicity,
8 1126   And captive good attending captain ill:
8 1127     Tir'd with all these, from these would I be gone,
8 1128     Save that, to die, I leave my love alone.
8 1129 
8 1130   LXVII
8 1131 
8 1132   Ah! wherefore with infection should he live,
8 1133   And with his presence grace impiety,
8 1134   That sin by him advantage should achieve,
8 1135   And lace itself with his society?
8 1136   Why should false painting imitate his cheek,
8 1137   And steel dead seeming of his living hue?
8 1138   Why should poor beauty indirectly seek
8 1139   Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?
8 1140   Why should he live, now Nature bankrupt is,
8 1141   Beggar'd of blood to blush through lively veins?
8 1142   For she hath no exchequer now but his,
8 1143   And proud of many, lives upon his gains.
8 1144     O! him she stores, to show what wealth she had
8 1145     In days long since, before these last so bad.
8 1146 
8 1147   LXVIII
8 1148 
8 1149   Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn,
8 1150   When beauty lived and died as flowers do now,
8 1151   Before these bastard signs of fair were born,
8 1152   Or durst inhabit on a living brow;
8 1153   Before the golden tresses of the dead,
8 1154   The right of sepulchres, were shorn away,
8 1155   To live a second life on second head;
8 1156   Ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay:
8 1157   In him those holy antique hours are seen,
8 1158   Without all ornament, itself and true,
8 1159   Making no summer of another's green,
8 1160   Robbing no old to dress his beauty new;
8 1161     And him as for a map doth Nature store,
8 1162     To show false Art what beauty was of yore.
8 1163 
8 1164   LXIX
8 1165 
8 1166   Those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view
8 1167   Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend;
8 1168   All tongues--the voice of souls--give thee that due,
8 1169   Uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend.
8 1170   Thy outward thus with outward praise is crown'd;
8 1171   But those same tongues, that give thee so thine own,
8 1172   In other accents do this praise confound
8 1173   By seeing farther than the eye hath shown.
8 1174   They look into the beauty of thy mind,
8 1175   And that in guess they measure by thy deeds;
8 1176   Then--churls--their thoughts, although their eyes were kind,
8 1177   To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds:
8 1178     But why thy odour matcheth not thy show,
8 1179     The soil is this, that thou dost common grow.
8 1180 
8 1181   LXX
8 1182 
8 1183   That thou art blam'd shall not be thy defect,
8 1184   For slander's mark was ever yet the fair;
8 1185   The ornament of beauty is suspect,
8 1186   A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.
8 1187   So thou be good, slander doth but approve
8 1188   Thy worth the greater being woo'd of time;
8 1189   For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,
8 1190   And thou present'st a pure unstained prime.
8 1191   Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days
8 1192   Either not assail'd, or victor being charg'd;
8 1193   Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,
8 1194   To tie up envy, evermore enlarg'd,
8 1195     If some suspect of ill mask'd not thy show,
8 1196     Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.

8 1198   LXXI
8 1199 
8 1200   No longer mourn for me when I am dead
8 1201   Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell
8 1202   Give warning to the world that I am fled
8 1203   From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell:
8 1204   Nay, if you read this line, remember not
8 1205   The hand that writ it, for I love you so,
8 1206   That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot,
8 1207   If thinking on me then should make you woe.
8 1208   O! if,--I say you look upon this verse,
8 1209   When I perhaps compounded am with clay,
8 1210   Do not so much as my poor name rehearse;
8 1211   But let your love even with my life decay;
8 1212     Lest the wise world should look into your moan,
8 1213     And mock you with me after I am gone.
8 1214 
8 1215   LXXII
8 1216 
8 1217   O! lest the world should task you to recite
8 1218   What merit lived in me, that you should love
8 1219   After my death,--dear love, forget me quite,
8 1220   For you in me can nothing worthy prove;
8 1221   Unless you would devise some virtuous lie,
8 1222   To do more for me than mine own desert,
8 1223   And hang more praise upon deceased I
8 1224   Than niggard truth would willingly impart:
8 1225   O! lest your true love may seem false in this
8 1226   That you for love speak well of me untrue,
8 1227   My name be buried where my body is,
8 1228   And live no more to shame nor me nor you.
8 1229     For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,
8 1230     And so should you, to love things nothing worth.
8 1231 
8 1232   LXXIII
8 1233 
8 1234   That time of year thou mayst in me behold
8 1235   When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang
8 1236   Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,
8 1237   Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.
8 1238   In me thou see'st the twilight of such day
8 1239   As after sunset fadeth in the west;
8 1240   Which by and by black night doth take away,
8 1241   Death's second self, that seals up all in rest.
8 1242   In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire,
8 1243   That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,
8 1244   As the death-bed, whereon it must expire,
8 1245   Consum'd with that which it was nourish'd by.
8 1246     This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,
8 1247     To love that well, which thou must leave ere long.
8 1248 
8 1249   LXXIV
8 1250 
8 1251   But be contented: when that fell arrest
8 1252   Without all bail shall carry me away,
8 1253   My life hath in this line some interest,
8 1254   Which for memorial still with thee shall stay.
8 1255   When thou reviewest this, thou dost review
8 1256   The very part was consecrate to thee:
8 1257   The earth can have but earth, which is his due;
8 1258   My spirit is thine, the better part of me:
8 1259   So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,
8 1260   The prey of worms, my body being dead;
8 1261   The coward conquest of a wretch's knife,
8 1262   Too base of thee to be remembered.
8 1263     The worth of that is that which it contains,
8 1264     And that is this, and this with thee remains.
8 1265 
8 1266   LXXV
8 1267 
8 1268   So are you to my thoughts as food to life,
8 1269   Or as sweet-season'd showers are to the ground;
8 1270   And for the peace of you I hold such strife
8 1271   As 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found.
8 1272   Now proud as an enjoyer, and anon
8 1273   Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure;
8 1274   Now counting best to be with you alone,
8 1275   Then better'd that the world may see my pleasure:
8 1276   Sometime all full with feasting on your sight,
8 1277   And by and by clean starved for a look;
8 1278   Possessing or pursuing no delight,
8 1279   Save what is had, or must from you be took.
8 1280     Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,
8 1281     Or gluttoning on all, or all away.
8 1282 
8 1283   LXXVI
8 1284 
8 1285   Why is my verse so barren of new pride,
8 1286   So far from variation or quick change?
8 1287   Why with the time do I not glance aside
8 1288   To new-found methods, and to compounds strange?
8 1289   Why write I still all one, ever the same,
8 1290   And keep invention in a noted weed,
8 1291   That every word doth almost tell my name,
8 1292   Showing their birth, and where they did proceed?
8 1293   O! know sweet love I always write of you,
8 1294   And you and love are still my argument;
8 1295   So all my best is dressing old words new,
8 1296   Spending again what is already spent:
8 1297     For as the sun is daily new and old,
8 1298     So is my love still telling what is told.

8 1302   Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,
8 1303   Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste;
8 1304   These vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear,
8 1305   And of this book, this learning mayst thou taste.
8 1306   The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show
8 1307   Of mouthed graves will give thee memory;
8 1308   Thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know
8 1309   Time's thievish progress to eternity.
8 1310   Look! what thy memory cannot contain,
8 1311   Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find
8 1312   Those children nursed, deliver'd from thy brain,
8 1313   To take a new acquaintance of thy mind.
8 1314     These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,
8 1315     Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book.

8 1319   So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse,
8 1320   And found such fair assistance in my verse
8 1321   As every alien pen hath got my use
8 1322   And under thee their poesy disperse.
8 1323   Thine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing
8 1324   And heavy ignorance aloft to fly,
8 1325   Have added feathers to the learned's wing
8 1326   And given grace a double majesty.
8 1327   Yet be most proud of that which I compile,
8 1328   Whose influence is thine, and born of thee:
8 1329   In others' works thou dost but mend the style,
8 1330   And arts with thy sweet graces graced be;
8 1331     But thou art all my art, and dost advance
8 1332     As high as learning, my rude ignorance.

8 1334   LXXIX
8 1335 
8 1336   Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,
8 1337   My verse alone had all thy gentle grace;
8 1338   But now my gracious numbers are decay'd,
8 1339   And my sick Muse doth give an other place.
8 1340   I grant, sweet love, thy lovely argument
8 1341   Deserves the travail of a worthier pen;
8 1342   Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent
8 1343   He robs thee of, and pays it thee again.
8 1344   He lends thee virtue, and he stole that word
8 1345   From thy behaviour; beauty doth he give,
8 1346   And found it in thy cheek: he can afford
8 1347   No praise to thee, but what in thee doth live.
8 1348     Then thank him not for that which he doth say,
8 1349     Since what he owes thee, thou thyself dost pay.

8 1353   O! how I faint when I of you do write,
8 1354   Knowing a better spirit doth use your name,
8 1355   And in the praise thereof spends all his might,
8 1356   To make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame!
8 1357   But since your worth--wide as the ocean is,--
8 1358   The humble as the proudest sail doth bear,
8 1359   My saucy bark, inferior far to his,
8 1360   On your broad main doth wilfully appear.
8 1361   Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat,
8 1362   Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride;
8 1363   Or, being wrack'd, I am a worthless boat,
8 1364   He of tall building, and of goodly pride:
8 1365     Then if he thrive and I be cast away,
8 1366     The worst was this,--my love was my decay.

8 1370   Or I shall live your epitaph to make,
8 1371   Or you survive when I in earth am rotten;
8 1372   From hence your memory death cannot take,
8 1373   Although in me each part will be forgotten.
8 1374   Your name from hence immortal life shall have,
8 1375   Though I, once gone, to all the world must die:
8 1376   The earth can yield me but a common grave,
8 1377   When you entombed in men's eyes shall lie.
8 1378   Your monument shall be my gentle verse,
8 1379   Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read;
8 1380   And tongues to be, your being shall rehearse,
8 1381   When all the breathers of this world are dead;
8 1382     You still shall live,--such virtue hath my pen,--
8 1383     Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men.

8 1387   I grant thou wert not married to my Muse,
8 1388   And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook
8 1389   The dedicated words which writers use
8 1390   Of their fair subject, blessing every book.
8 1391   Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,
8 1392   Finding thy worth a limit past my praise;
8 1393   And therefore art enforced to seek anew
8 1394   Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days.
8 1395   And do so, love; yet when they have devis'd,
8 1396   What strained touches rhetoric can lend,
8 1397   Thou truly fair, wert truly sympathiz'd
8 1398   In true plain words, by thy true-telling friend;
8 1399     And their gross painting might be better us'd
8 1400     Where cheeks need blood; in thee it is abus'd.
8 1401 
8 1402   LXXXIII
8 1403 
8 1404   I never saw that you did painting need,
8 1405   And therefore to your fair no painting set;
8 1406   I found, or thought I found, you did exceed
8 1407   That barren tender of a poet's debt:
8 1408   And therefore have I slept in your report,
8 1409   That you yourself, being extant, well might show
8 1410   How far a modern quill doth come too short,
8 1411   Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.
8 1412   This silence for my sin you did impute,
8 1413   Which shall be most my glory being dumb;
8 1414   For I impair not beauty being mute,
8 1415   When others would give life, and bring a tomb.
8 1416     There lives more life in one of your fair eyes
8 1417     Than both your poets can in praise devise.

8 1421   Who is it that says most, which can say more,
8 1422   Than this rich praise,--that you alone, are you?
8 1423   In whose confine immured is the store
8 1424   Which should example where your equal grew.
8 1425   Lean penury within that pen doth dwell
8 1426   That to his subject lends not some small glory;
8 1427   But he that writes of you, if he can tell
8 1428   That you are you, so dignifies his story,
8 1429   Let him but copy what in you is writ,
8 1430   Not making worse what nature made so clear,
8 1431   And such a counterpart shall fame his wit,
8 1432   Making his style admired every where.
8 1433     You to your beauteous blessings add a curse,
8 1434     Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.
8 1435 
8 1436   LXXXV
8 1437 
8 1438   My tongue-tied Muse in manners holds her still,
8 1439   While comments of your praise richly compil'd,
8 1440   Reserve their character with golden quill,
8 1441   And precious phrase by all the Muses fil'd.
8 1442   I think good thoughts, whilst others write good words,
8 1443   And like unlettered clerk still cry 'Amen'
8 1444   To every hymn that able spirit affords,
8 1445   In polish'd form of well-refined pen.
8 1446   Hearing you praised, I say ''tis so, 'tis true,'
8 1447   And to the most of praise add something more;
8 1448   But that is in my thought, whose love to you,
8 1449   Though words come hindmost, holds his rank before.
8 1450     Then others, for the breath of words respect,
8 1451     Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.

8 1454 
8 1455   Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,
8 1456   Bound for the prize of all too precious you,
8 1457   That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,
8 1458   Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?
8 1459   Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write,
8 1460   Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?
8 1461   No, neither he, nor his compeers by night
8 1462   Giving him aid, my verse astonished.
8 1463   He, nor that affable familiar ghost
8 1464   Which nightly gulls him with intelligence,
8 1465   As victors of my silence cannot boast;
8 1466   I was not sick of any fear from thence:
8 1467     But when your countenance fill'd up his line,
8 1468     Then lacked I matter; that enfeebled mine.

8 1471 
8 1472   Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,
8 1473   And like enough thou know'st thy estimate,
8 1474   The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;
8 1475   My bonds in thee are all determinate.
8 1476   For how do I hold thee but by thy granting?
8 1477   And for that riches where is my deserving?
8 1478   The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,
8 1479   And so my patent back again is swerving.
8 1480   Thy self thou gav'st, thy own worth then not knowing,
8 1481   Or me to whom thou gav'st it, else mistaking;
8 1482   So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,
8 1483   Comes home again, on better judgement making.
8 1484     Thus have I had thee, as a dream doth flatter,
8 1485     In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.

8 1487   LXXXVIII
8 1488 
8 1489   When thou shalt be dispos'd to set me light,
8 1490   And place my merit in the eye of scorn,
8 1491   Upon thy side, against myself I'll fight,
8 1492   And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn.
8 1493   With mine own weakness, being best acquainted,
8 1494   Upon thy part I can set down a story
8 1495   Of faults conceal'd, wherein I am attainted;
8 1496   That thou in losing me shalt win much glory:
8 1497   And I by this will be a gainer too;
8 1498   For bending all my loving thoughts on thee,
8 1499   The injuries that to myself I do,
8 1500   Doing thee vantage, double-vantage me.
8 1501     Such is my love, to thee I so belong,
8 1502     That for thy right, myself will bear all wrong.
8 1503 
8 1504   LXXXIX
8 1505 
8 1506   Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault,
8 1507   And I will comment upon that offence:
8 1508   Speak of my lameness, and I straight will halt,
8 1509   Against thy reasons making no defence.
8 1510   Thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill,
8 1511   To set a form upon desired change,
8 1512   As I'll myself disgrace; knowing thy will,
8 1513   I will acquaintance strangle, and look strange;
8 1514   Be absent from thy walks; and in my tongue
8 1515   Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,
8 1516   Lest I, too much profane, should do it wrong,
8 1517   And haply of our old acquaintance tell.
8 1518     For thee, against my self I'll vow debate,
8 1519     For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate.
8 1520 
8 1521   XC
8 1522 
8 1523   Then hate me when thou wilt; if ever, now;
8 1524   Now, while the world is bent my deeds to cross,
8 1525   Join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,
8 1526   And do not drop in for an after-loss:
8 1527   Ah! do not, when my heart hath 'scap'd this sorrow,
8 1528   Come in the rearward of a conquer'd woe;
8 1529   Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,
8 1530   To linger out a purpos'd overthrow.
8 1531   If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,
8 1532   When other petty griefs have done their spite,
8 1533   But in the onset come: so shall I taste
8 1534   At first the very worst of fortune's might;
8 1535     And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,
8 1536     Compar'd with loss of thee, will not seem so.

8 1540   Some glory in their birth, some in their skill,
8 1541   Some in their wealth, some in their body's force,
8 1542   Some in their garments though new-fangled ill;
8 1543   Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse;
8 1544   And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,
8 1545   Wherein it finds a joy above the rest:
8 1546   But these particulars are not my measure,
8 1547   All these I better in one general best.
8 1548   Thy love is better than high birth to me,
8 1549   Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' costs,
8 1550   Of more delight than hawks and horses be;
8 1551   And having thee, of all men's pride I boast:
8 1552     Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take
8 1553     All this away, and me most wretchcd make.

8 1556 
8 1557   But do thy worst to steal thyself away,
8 1558   For term of life thou art assured mine;
8 1559   And life no longer than thy love will stay,
8 1560   For it depends upon that love of thine.
8 1561   Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs,
8 1562   When in the least of them my life hath end.
8 1563   I see a better state to me belongs
8 1564   Than that which on thy humour doth depend:
8 1565   Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind,
8 1566   Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie.
8 1567   O! what a happy title do I find,
8 1568   Happy to have thy love, happy to die!
8 1569     But what's so blessed-fair that fears no blot?
8 1570     Thou mayst be false, and yet I know it not.

8 1574   So shall I live, supposing thou art true,
8 1575   Like a deceived husband; so love's face
8 1576   May still seem love to me, though alter'd new;
8 1577   Thy looks with me, thy heart in other place:
8 1578   For there can live no hatred in thine eye,
8 1579   Therefore in that I cannot know thy change.
8 1580   In many's looks, the false heart's history
8 1581   Is writ in moods, and frowns, and wrinkles strange.
8 1582   But heaven in thy creation did decree
8 1583   That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell;
8 1584   Whate'er thy thoughts, or thy heart's workings be,
8 1585   Thy looks should nothing thence, but sweetness tell.
8 1586     How like Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow,
8 1587     If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show!

8 1591   They that have power to hurt, and will do none,
8 1592   That do not do the thing they most do show,
8 1593   Who, moving others, are themselves as stone,
8 1594   Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow;
8 1595   They rightly do inherit heaven's graces,
8 1596   And husband nature's riches from expense;
8 1597   They are the lords and owners of their faces,
8 1598   Others, but stewards of their excellence.
8 1599   The summer's flower is to the summer sweet,
8 1600   Though to itself, it only live and die,
8 1601   But if that flower with base infection meet,
8 1602   The basest weed outbraves his dignity:
8 1603     For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;
8 1604     Lilies that fester, smell far worse than weeds.

8 1609   Which, like a canker in the fragrant rose,
8 1610   Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name!
8 1611   O! in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose.
8 1612   That tongue that tells the story of thy days,
8 1613   Making lascivious comments on thy sport,
8 1614   Cannot dispraise, but in a kind of praise;
8 1615   Naming thy name, blesses an ill report.
8 1616   O! what a mansion have those vices got
8 1617   Which for their habitation chose out thee,
8 1618   Where beauty's veil doth cover every blot
8 1619   And all things turns to fair that eyes can see!
8 1620     Take heed, dear heart, of this large privilege;
8 1621     The hardest knife ill-us'd doth lose his edge.

8 1625   Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness;
8 1626   Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport;
8 1627   Both grace and faults are lov'd of more and less:
8 1628   Thou mak'st faults graces that to thee resort.
8 1629   As on the finger of a throned queen
8 1630   The basest jewel will be well esteem'd,
8 1631   So are those errors that in thee are seen
8 1632   To truths translated, and for true things deem'd.
8 1633   How many lambs might the stern wolf betray,
8 1634   If like a lamb he could his looks translate!
8 1635   How many gazers mightst thou lead away,
8 1636   if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!

8 1643   From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!
8 1644   What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!
8 1645   What old December's bareness everywhere!
8 1646   And yet this time removed was summer's time;
8 1647   The teeming autumn, big with rich increase,
8 1648   Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,
8 1649   Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:
8 1650   Yet this abundant issue seem'd to me
8 1651   But hope of orphans, and unfather'd fruit;
8 1652   For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,
8 1653   And, thou away, the very birds are mute:
8 1654     Or, if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer,
8 1655     That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near.

8 1661   Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing,
8 1662   That heavy Saturn laugh'd and leap'd with him.
8 1663   Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell
8 1664   Of different flowers in odour and in hue,
8 1665   Could make me any summer's story tell,
8 1666   Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew:
8 1667   Nor did I wonder at the lily's white,
8 1668   Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;
8 1669   They were but sweet, but figures of delight,
8 1670   Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.
8 1671     Yet seem'd it winter still, and you away,

8 1678   If not from my love's breath? The purple pride
8 1679   Which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells
8 1680   In my love's veins thou hast too grossly dy'd.
8 1681   The lily I condemned for thy hand,
8 1682   And buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair;
8 1683   The roses fearfully on thorns did stand,
8 1684   One blushing shame, another white despair;
8 1685   A third, nor red nor white, had stol'n of both,
8 1686   And to his robbery had annex'd thy breath;
8 1687   But, for his theft, in pride of all his growth
8 1688   A vengeful canker eat him up to death.
8 1689     More flowers I noted, yet I none could see,
8 1690     But sweet, or colour it had stol'n from thee.

8 1697   Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light?
8 1698   Return forgetful Muse, and straight redeem,
8 1699   In gentle numbers time so idly spent;

8 1701   And gives thy pen both skill and argument.

8 1703   If Time have any wrinkle graven there;
8 1704   If any, be a satire to decay,
8 1705   And make time's spoils despised every where.

8 1714   So dost thou too, and therein dignified.
8 1715   Make answer Muse: wilt thou not haply say,
8 1716   'Truth needs no colour, with his colour fix'd;
8 1717   Beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay;
8 1718   But best is best, if never intermix'd'?
8 1719   Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?
8 1720   Excuse not silence so, for't lies in thee
8 1721   To make him much outlive a gilded tomb
8 1722   And to be prais'd of ages yet to be.
8 1723     Then do thy office, Muse; I teach thee how
8 1724     To make him seem long hence as he shows now.
8 1725 
8 1726   CII
8 1727 
8 1728   My love is strengthen'd, though more weak in seeming;
8 1729   I love not less, though less the show appear;
8 1730   That love is merchandiz'd, whose rich esteeming,
8 1731   The owner's tongue doth publish every where.
8 1732   Our love was new, and then but in the spring,
8 1733   When I was wont to greet it with my lays;
8 1734   As Philomel in summer's front doth sing,
8 1735   And stops her pipe in growth of riper days:
8 1736   Not that the summer is less pleasant now
8 1737   Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,
8 1738   But that wild music burthens every bough,
8 1739   And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.
8 1740     Therefore like her, I sometime hold my tongue:
8 1741     Because I would not dull you with my song.
8 1742 
8 1743   CIII
8 1744 
8 1745   Alack! what poverty my Muse brings forth,
8 1746   That having such a scope to show her pride,
8 1747   The argument, all bare, is of more worth
8 1748   Than when it hath my added praise beside!
8 1749   O! blame me not, if I no more can write!
8 1750   Look in your glass, and there appears a face
8 1751   That over-goes my blunt invention quite,
8 1752   Dulling my lines, and doing me disgrace.
8 1753   Were it not sinful then, striving to mend,
8 1754   To mar the subject that before was well?
8 1755   For to no other pass my verses tend
8 1756   Than of your graces and your gifts to tell;
8 1757     And more, much more, than in my verse can sit,
8 1758     Your own glass shows you when you look in it.
8 1759 
8 1760   CIV
8 1761 
8 1762   To me, fair friend, you never can be old,
8 1763   For as you were when first your eye I ey'd,
8 1764   Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold,
8 1765   Have from the forests shook three summers' pride,
8 1766   Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd,
8 1767   In process of the seasons have I seen,
8 1768   Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burn'd,
8 1769   Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.
8 1770   Ah! yet doth beauty like a dial-hand,
8 1771   Steal from his figure, and no pace perceiv'd;
8 1772   So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,
8 1773   Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceiv'd:
8 1774     For fear of which, hear this thou age unbred:
8 1775     Ere you were born was beauty's summer dead.
8 1776 
8 1777   CV
8 1778 
8 1779   Let not my love be call'd idolatry,
8 1780   Nor my beloved as an idol show,
8 1781   Since all alike my songs and praises be
8 1782   To one, of one, still such, and ever so.
8 1783   Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,
8 1784   Still constant in a wondrous excellence;
8 1785   Therefore my verse to constancy confin'd,
8 1786   One thing expressing, leaves out difference.
8 1787   'Fair, kind, and true,' is all my argument,
8 1788   'Fair, kind, and true,' varying to other words;
8 1789   And in this change is my invention spent,
8 1790   Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.
8 1791     Fair, kind, and true, have often liv'd alone,
8 1792     Which three till now, never kept seat in one.
8 1793 
8 1794   CVI
8 1795 
8 1796   When in the chronicle of wasted time
8 1797   I see descriptions of the fairest wights,
8 1798   And beauty making beautiful old rime,
8 1799   In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights,
8 1800   Then, in the blazon of sweet beauty's best,
8 1801   Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,
8 1802   I see their antique pen would have express'd
8 1803   Even such a beauty as you master now.
8 1804   So all their praises are but prophecies
8 1805   Of this our time, all you prefiguring;
8 1806   And for they looked but with divining eyes,
8 1807   They had not skill enough your worth to sing:
8 1808     For we, which now behold these present days,
8 1809     Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.
8 1810 
8 1811   CVII
8 1812 
8 1813   Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul
8 1814   Of the wide world dreaming on things to come,
8 1815   Can yet the lease of my true love control,
8 1816   Supposed as forfeit to a confin'd doom.
8 1817   The mortal moon hath her eclipse endur'd,
8 1818   And the sad augurs mock their own presage;
8 1819   Incertainties now crown themselves assur'd,
8 1820   And peace proclaims olives of endless age.
8 1821   Now with the drops of this most balmy time,
8 1822   My love looks fresh, and Death to me subscribes,
8 1823   Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rime,
8 1824   While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes:
8 1825     And thou in this shalt find thy monument,
8 1826     When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.
8 1827 
8 1828   CVIII
8 1829 
8 1830   What's in the brain, that ink may character,
8 1831   Which hath not figur'd to thee my true spirit?
8 1832   What's new to speak, what now to register,
8 1833   That may express my love, or thy dear merit?
8 1834   Nothing, sweet boy; but yet, like prayers divine,
8 1835   I must each day say o'er the very same;
8 1836   Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,
8 1837   Even as when first I hallow'd thy fair name.
8 1838   So that eternal love in love's fresh case,
8 1839   Weighs not the dust and injury of age,
8 1840   Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,
8 1841   But makes antiquity for aye his page;
8 1842     Finding the first conceit of love there bred,
8 1843     Where time and outward form would show it dead.
8 1844 
8 1845   CIX
8 1846 
8 1847   O! never say that I was false of heart,
8 1848   Though absence seem'd my flame to qualify,
8 1849   As easy might I from my self depart
8 1850   As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie:
8 1851   That is my home of love: if I have rang'd,
8 1852   Like him that travels, I return again;
8 1853   Just to the time, not with the time exchang'd,
8 1854   So that myself bring water for my stain.
8 1855   Never believe though in my nature reign'd,
8 1856   All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,
8 1857   That it could so preposterously be stain'd,
8 1858   To leave for nothing all thy sum of good;
8 1859     For nothing this wide universe I call,
8 1860     Save thou, my rose, in it thou art my all.
8 1861 
8 1862   CX
8 1863 
8 1864   Alas! 'tis true, I have gone here and there,
8 1865   And made my self a motley to the view,
8 1866   Gor'd mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,
8 1867   Made old offences of affections new;
8 1868   Most true it is, that I have look'd on truth
8 1869   Askance and strangely; but, by all above,
8 1870   These blenches gave my heart another youth,
8 1871   And worse essays prov'd thee my best of love.
8 1872   Now all is done, save what shall have no end:
8 1873   Mine appetite I never more will grind
8 1874   On newer proof, to try an older friend,
8 1875   A god in love, to whom I am confin'd.
8 1876     Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,
8 1877     Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.
8 1878 
8 1879   CXI
8 1880 
8 1881   O! for my sake do you with Fortune chide,
8 1882   The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,
8 1883   That did not better for my life provide
8 1884   Than public means which public manners breeds.
8 1885   Thence comes it that my name receives a brand,
8 1886   And almost thence my nature is subdu'd
8 1887   To what it works in, like the dyer's hand:
8 1888   Pity me, then, and wish I were renew'd;
8 1889   Whilst, like a willing patient, I will drink,
8 1890   Potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection;
8 1891   No bitterness that I will bitter think,
8 1892   Nor double penance, to correct correction.
8 1893     Pity me then, dear friend, and I assure ye,
8 1894     Even that your pity is enough to cure me.
8 1895 
8 1896   CXII
8 1897 
8 1898   Your love and pity doth the impression fill,
8 1899   Which vulgar scandal stamp'd upon my brow;
8 1900   For what care I who calls me well or ill,
8 1901   So you o'er-green my bad, my good allow?
8 1902   You are my all-the-world, and I must strive
8 1903   To know my shames and praises from your tongue;
8 1904   None else to me, nor I to none alive,
8 1905   That my steel'd sense or changes right or wrong.
8 1906   In so profound abysm I throw all care
8 1907   Of others' voices, that my adder's sense
8 1908   To critic and to flatterer stopped are.
8 1909   Mark how with my neglect I do dispense:
8 1910     You are so strongly in my purpose bred,
8 1911     That all the world besides methinks are dead.
8 1912 
8 1913   CXIII
8 1914 
8 1915   Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind;
8 1916   And that which governs me to go about
8 1917   Doth part his function and is partly blind,
8 1918   Seems seeing, but effectually is out;
8 1919   For it no form delivers to the heart
8 1920   Of bird, of flower, or shape which it doth latch:
8 1921   Of his quick objects hath the mind no part,
8 1922   Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch;
8 1923   For if it see the rud'st or gentlest sight,
8 1924   The most sweet favour or deformed'st creature,
8 1925   The mountain or the sea, the day or night:
8 1926   The crow, or dove, it shapes them to your feature.
8 1927     Incapable of more, replete with you,
8 1928     My most true mind thus maketh mine untrue.
8 1929 
8 1930   CXIV
8 1931 
8 1932   Or whether doth my mind, being crown'd with you,
8 1933   Drink up the monarch's plague, this flattery?
8 1934   Or whether shall I say, mine eye saith true,
8 1935   And that your love taught it this alchemy,
8 1936   To make of monsters and things indigest
8 1937   Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble,
8 1938   Creating every bad a perfect best,
8 1939   As fast as objects to his beams assemble?
8 1940   O! 'tis the first, 'tis flattery in my seeing,
8 1941   And my great mind most kingly drinks it up:
8 1942   Mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing,
8 1943   And to his palate doth prepare the cup:
8 1944     If it be poison'd, 'tis the lesser sin
8 1945     That mine eye loves it and doth first begin.
8 1946 
8 1947   CXV
8 1948 
8 1949   Those lines that I before have writ do lie,
8 1950   Even those that said I could not love you dearer:
8 1951   Yet then my judgment knew no reason why
8 1952   My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer.
8 1953   But reckoning Time, whose million'd accidents
8 1954   Creep in 'twixt vows, and change decrees of kings,
8 1955   Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents,
8 1956   Divert strong minds to the course of altering things;
8 1957   Alas! why fearing of Time's tyranny,
8 1958   Might I not then say, 'Now I love you best,'
8 1959   When I was certain o'er incertainty,
8 1960   Crowning the present, doubting of the rest?
8 1961     Love is a babe, then might I not say so,
8 1962     To give full growth to that which still doth grow?
8 1963 
8 1964   CXVI
8 1965 
8 1966   Let me not to the marriage of true minds
8 1967   Admit impediments. Love is not love
8 1968   Which alters when it alteration finds,
8 1969   Or bends with the remover to remove:
8 1970   O, no! it is an ever-fixed mark,
8 1971   That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
8 1972   It is the star to every wandering bark,
8 1973   Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
8 1974   Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
8 1975   Within his bending sickle's compass come;
8 1976   Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
8 1977   But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
8 1978     If this be error and upon me prov'd,
8 1979     I never writ, nor no man ever lov'd.
8 1980 
8 1981   CXVII
8 1982 
8 1983   Accuse me thus: that I have scanted all,
8 1984   Wherein I should your great deserts repay,
8 1985   Forgot upon your dearest love to call,
8 1986   Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day;
8 1987   That I have frequent been with unknown minds,
8 1988   And given to time your own dear-purchas'd right;
8 1989   That I have hoisted sail to all the winds
8 1990   Which should transport me farthest from your sight.
8 1991   Book both my wilfulness and errors down,
8 1992   And on just proof surmise, accumulate;
8 1993   Bring me within the level of your frown,
8 1994   But shoot not at me in your waken'd hate;
8 1995     Since my appeal says I did strive to prove
8 1996     The constancy and virtue of your love.
8 1997 
8 1998   CXVIII
8 1999 
8 2000   Like as, to make our appetite more keen,
8 2001   With eager compounds we our palate urge;
8 2002   As, to prevent our maladies unseen,
8 2003   We sicken to shun sickness when we purge;
8 2004   Even so, being full of your ne'er-cloying sweetness,
8 2005   To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding;
8 2006   And, sick of welfare, found a kind of meetness
8 2007   To be diseas'd, ere that there was true needing.
8 2008   Thus policy in love, to anticipate
8 2009   The ills that were not, grew to faults assur'd,
8 2010   And brought to medicine a healthful state
8 2011   Which, rank of goodness, would by ill be cur'd;
8 2012     But thence I learn and find the lesson true,
8 2013     Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you.
8 2014 
8 2015   CXIX
8 2016 
8 2017   What potions have I drunk of Siren tears,
8 2018   Distill'd from limbecks foul as hell within,
8 2019   Applying fears to hopes, and hopes to fears,
8 2020   Still losing when I saw myself to win!
8 2021   What wretched errors hath my heart committed,
8 2022   Whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never!
8 2023   How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted,
8 2024   In the distraction of this madding fever!
8 2025   O benefit of ill! now I find true
8 2026   That better is, by evil still made better;
8 2027   And ruin'd love, when it is built anew,
8 2028   Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater.
8 2029     So I return rebuk'd to my content,
8 2030     And gain by ill thrice more than I have spent.
8 2031 
8 2032   CXX
8 2033 
8 2034   That you were once unkind befriends me now,
8 2035   And for that sorrow, which I then did feel,
8 2036   Needs must I under my transgression bow,
8 2037   Unless my nerves were brass or hammer'd steel.
8 2038   For if you were by my unkindness shaken,
8 2039   As I by yours, you've pass'd a hell of time;
8 2040   And I, a tyrant, have no leisure taken
8 2041   To weigh how once I suffer'd in your crime.
8 2042   O! that our night of woe might have remember'd
8 2043   My deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits,
8 2044   And soon to you, as you to me, then tender'd
8 2045   The humble salve, which wounded bosoms fits!
8 2046     But that your trespass now becomes a fee;
8 2047     Mine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me.
8 2048 
8 2049   CXXI
8 2050 
8 2051   'Tis better to be vile than vile esteem'd,
8 2052   When not to be receives reproach of being;
8 2053   And the just pleasure lost, which is so deem'd
8 2054   Not by our feeling, but by others' seeing:
8 2055   For why should others' false adulterate eyes
8 2056   Give salutation to my sportive blood?
8 2057   Or on my frailties why are frailer spies,
8 2058   Which in their wills count bad what I think good?
8 2059   No, I am that I am, and they that level
8 2060   At my abuses reckon up their own:
8 2061   I may be straight though they themselves be bevel;
8 2062   By their rank thoughts, my deeds must not be shown;
8 2063     Unless this general evil they maintain,
8 2064     All men are bad and in their badness reign.
8 2065 
8 2066   CXXII
8 2067 
8 2068   Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain
8 2069   Full character'd with lasting memory,
8 2070   Which shall above that idle rank remain,
8 2071   Beyond all date; even to eternity:
8 2072   Or, at the least, so long as brain and heart
8 2073   Have faculty by nature to subsist;
8 2074   Till each to raz'd oblivion yield his part
8 2075   Of thee, thy record never can be miss'd.
8 2076   That poor retention could not so much hold,
8 2077   Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score;
8 2078   Therefore to give them from me was I bold,
8 2079   To trust those tables that receive thee more:
8 2080     To keep an adjunct to remember thee
8 2081     Were to import forgetfulness in me.
8 2082 
8 2083   CXXIII
8 2084 
8 2085   No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change:
8 2086   Thy pyramids built up with newer might
8 2087   To me are nothing novel, nothing strange;
8 2088   They are but dressings of a former sight.
8 2089   Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire
8 2090   What thou dost foist upon us that is old;
8 2091   And rather make them born to our desire
8 2092   Than think that we before have heard them told.
8 2093   Thy registers and thee I both defy,
8 2094   Not wondering at the present nor the past,
8 2095   For thy records and what we see doth lie,
8 2096   Made more or less by thy continual haste.
8 2097     This I do vow and this shall ever be;
8 2098     I will be true despite thy scythe and thee.
8 2099 
8 2100   CXXIV
8 2101 
8 2102   If my dear love were but the child of state,
8 2103   It might for Fortune's bastard be unfather'd,
8 2104   As subject to Time's love or to Time's hate,
8 2105   Weeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gather'd.
8 2106   No, it was builded far from accident;
8 2107   It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls
8 2108   Under the blow of thralled discontent,
8 2109   Whereto th' inviting time our fashion calls:
8 2110   It fears not policy, that heretic,
8 2111   Which works on leases of short-number'd hours,
8 2112   But all alone stands hugely politic,
8 2113   That it nor grows with heat, nor drowns with showers.
8 2114     To this I witness call the fools of time,
8 2115     Which die for goodness, who have lived for crime.
8 2116 
8 2117   CXXV
8 2118 
8 2119   Were't aught to me I bore the canopy,
8 2120   With my extern the outward honouring,
8 2121   Or laid great bases for eternity,
8 2122   Which proves more short than waste or ruining?
8 2123   Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour
8 2124   Lose all and more by paying too much rent
8 2125   For compound sweet; forgoing simple savour,
8 2126   Pitiful thrivers, in their gazing spent?
8 2127   No; let me be obsequious in thy heart,
8 2128   And take thou my oblation, poor but free,
8 2129   Which is not mix'd with seconds, knows no art,
8 2130   But mutual render, only me for thee.
8 2131     Hence, thou suborned informer! a true soul
8 2132     When most impeach'd, stands least in thy control.

8 2135 
8 2136   O thou, my lovely boy, who in thy power
8 2137   Dost hold Time's fickle glass, his fickle hour;
8 2138   Who hast by waning grown, and therein show'st
8 2139   Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self grow'st.
8 2140   If Nature, sovereign mistress over wrack,
8 2141   As thou goest onwards, still will pluck thee back,
8 2142   She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill
8 2143   May time disgrace and wretched minutes kill.
8 2144   Yet fear her, O thou minion of her pleasure!
8 2145   She may detain, but not still keep, her treasure:
8 2146     Her audit (though delayed) answered must be,
8 2147     And her quietus is to render thee.

8 2151   In the old age black was not counted fair,
8 2152   Or if it were, it bore not beauty's name;
8 2153   But now is black beauty's successive heir,
8 2154   And beauty slander'd with a bastard shame:
8 2155   For since each hand hath put on Nature's power,
8 2156   Fairing the foul with Art's false borrowed face,
8 2157   Sweet beauty hath no name, no holy bower,
8 2158   But is profan'd, if not lives in disgrace.
8 2159   Therefore my mistress' eyes are raven black,
8 2160   Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem
8 2161   At such who, not born fair, no beauty lack,
8 2162   Sland'ring creation with a false esteem:
8 2163     Yet so they mourn becoming of their woe,
8 2164     That every tongue says beauty should look so.

8 2166   CXXVIII
8 2167 
8 2168   How oft when thou, my music, music play'st,
8 2169   Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds
8 2170   With thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway'st
8 2171   The wiry concord that mine ear confounds,
8 2172   Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap,
8 2173   To kiss the tender inward of thy hand,
8 2174   Whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap,
8 2175   At the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand!
8 2176   To be so tickled, they would change their state
8 2177   And situation with those dancing chips,
8 2178   O'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait,
8 2179   Making dead wood more bless'd than living lips.
8 2180     Since saucy jacks so happy are in this,
8 2181     Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.

8 2184 
8 2185   The expense of spirit in a waste of shame
8 2186   Is lust in action: and till action, lust
8 2187   Is perjur'd, murderous, bloody, full of blame,
8 2188   Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust;
8 2189   Enjoy'd no sooner but despised straight;
8 2190   Past reason hunted; and no sooner had,
8 2191   Past reason hated, as a swallow'd bait,
8 2192   On purpose laid to make the taker mad:
8 2193   Mad in pursuit and in possession so;
8 2194   Had, having, and in quest, to have extreme;
8 2195   A bliss in proof,-- and prov'd, a very woe;
8 2196   Before, a joy propos'd; behind a dream.
8 2197     All this the world well knows; yet none knows well
8 2198     To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.

8 2202   My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;
8 2203   Coral is far more red, than her lips red:
8 2204   If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;
8 2205   If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.
8 2206   I have seen roses damask'd, red and white,
8 2207   But no such roses see I in her cheeks;
8 2208   And in some perfumes is there more delight
8 2209   Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
8 2210   I love to hear her speak, yet well I know
8 2211   That music hath a far more pleasing sound:
8 2212   I grant I never saw a goddess go,--
8 2213   My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground:
8 2214     And yet by heaven, I think my love as rare,
8 2215     As any she belied with false compare.

8 2219   Thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art,
8 2220   As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel;
8 2221   For well thou know'st to my dear doting heart
8 2222   Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel.
8 2223   Yet, in good faith, some say that thee behold,
8 2224   Thy face hath not the power to make love groan;
8 2225   To say they err I dare not be so bold,
8 2226   Although I swear it to myself alone.
8 2227   And to be sure that is not false I swear,
8 2228   A thousand groans, but thinking on thy face,
8 2229   One on another's neck, do witness bear
8 2230   Thy black is fairest in my judgment's place.
8 2231     In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds,
8 2232     And thence this slander, as I think, proceeds.

8 2236   Thine eyes I love, and they, as pitying me,
8 2237   Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain,
8 2238   Have put on black and loving mourners be,
8 2239   Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain.
8 2240   And truly not the morning sun of heaven
8 2241   Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east,
8 2242   Nor that full star that ushers in the even,
8 2243   Doth half that glory to the sober west,
8 2244   As those two mourning eyes become thy face:
8 2245   O! let it then as well beseem thy heart
8 2246   To mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace,
8 2247   And suit thy pity like in every part.
8 2248     Then will I swear beauty herself is black,
8 2249     And all they foul that thy complexion lack.

8 2253   Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
8 2254   For that deep wound it gives my friend and me!
8 2255   Is't not enough to torture me alone,
8 2256   But slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be?
8 2257   Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken,
8 2258   And my next self thou harder hast engross'd:
8 2259   Of him, myself, and thee I am forsaken;
8 2260   A torment thrice three-fold thus to be cross'd:
8 2261   Prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward,
8 2262   But then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail;
8 2263   Whoe'er keeps me, let my heart be his guard;
8 2264   Thou canst not then use rigour in my jail:
8 2265     And yet thou wilt; for I, being pent in thee,

8 2273   Thou wilt restore to be my comfort still:
8 2274   But thou wilt not, nor he will not be free,
8 2275   For thou art covetous, and he is kind;
8 2276   He learn'd but surety-like to write for me,
8 2277   Under that bond that him as fast doth bind.
8 2278   The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take,
8 2279   Thou usurer, that putt'st forth all to use,
8 2280   And sue a friend came debtor for my sake;
8 2281   So him I lose through my unkind abuse.
8 2282     Him have I lost; thou hast both him and me:

8 2287   Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy 'Will,'

8 2289   More than enough am I that vex'd thee still,
8 2290   To thy sweet will making addition thus.
8 2291   Wilt thou, whose will is large and spacious,
8 2292   Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?
8 2293   Shall will in others seem right gracious,
8 2294   And in my will no fair acceptance shine?
8 2295   The sea, all water, yet receives rain still,
8 2296   And in abundance addeth to his store;
8 2297   So thou, being rich in 'Will,' add to thy 'Will'
8 2298   One will of mine, to make thy large will more.
8 2299     Let no unkind 'No' fair beseechers kill;
8 2300     Think all but one, and me in that one 'Will.'

8 2304   If thy soul check thee that I come so near,

8 2307   Thus far for love, my love-suit, sweet, fulfil.
8 2308   'Will', will fulfil the treasure of thy love,
8 2309   Ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one.
8 2310   In things of great receipt with ease we prove
8 2311   Among a number one is reckon'd none:
8 2312   Then in the number let me pass untold,
8 2313   Though in thy store's account I one must be;
8 2314   For nothing hold me, so it please thee hold
8 2315   That nothing me, a something sweet to thee:

8 2321   Thou blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes,
8 2322   That they behold, and see not what they see?
8 2323   They know what beauty is, see where it lies,
8 2324   Yet what the best is take the worst to be.
8 2325   If eyes, corrupt by over-partial looks,
8 2326   Be anchor'd in the bay where all men ride,
8 2327   Why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks,
8 2328   Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied?
8 2329   Why should my heart think that a several plot,
8 2330   Which my heart knows the wide world's common place?
8 2331   Or mine eyes, seeing this, say this is not,
8 2332   To put fair truth upon so foul a face?
8 2333     In things right true my heart and eyes have err'd,
8 2334     And to this false plague are they now transferr'd.

8 2338   When my love swears that she is made of truth,
8 2339   I do believe her though I know she lies,
8 2340   That she might think me some untutor'd youth,
8 2341   Unlearned in the world's false subtleties.
8 2342   Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,
8 2343   Although she knows my days are past the best,
8 2344   Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue:
8 2345   On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed:
8 2346   But wherefore says she not she is unjust?
8 2347   And wherefore say not I that I am old?
8 2348   O! love's best habit is in seeming trust,
8 2349   And age in love, loves not to have years told:
8 2350     Therefore I lie with her, and she with me,
8 2351     And in our faults by lies we flatter'd be.

8 2354 
8 2355   O! call not me to justify the wrong
8 2356   That thy unkindness lays upon my heart;
8 2357   Wound me not with thine eye, but with thy tongue:
8 2358   Use power with power, and slay me not by art,
8 2359   Tell me thou lov'st elsewhere; but in my sight,
8 2360   Dear heart, forbear to glance thine eye aside:
8 2361   What need'st thou wound with cunning, when thy might
8 2362   Is more than my o'erpress'd defence can bide?
8 2363   Let me excuse thee: ah! my love well knows
8 2364   Her pretty looks have been mine enemies;
8 2365   And therefore from my face she turns my foes,
8 2366   That they elsewhere might dart their injuries:
8 2367     Yet do not so; but since I am near slain,
8 2368     Kill me outright with looks, and rid my pain.

8 2376   The manner of my pity-wanting pain.
8 2377   If I might teach thee wit, better it were,
8 2378   Though not to love, yet, love to tell me so;--
8 2379   As testy sick men, when their deaths be near,
8 2380   No news but health from their physicians know;--
8 2381   For, if I should despair, I should grow mad,
8 2382   And in my madness might speak ill of thee;
8 2383   Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,
8 2384   Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be.

8 2393   Who, in despite of view, is pleased to dote.
8 2394   Nor are mine ears with thy tongue's tune delighted;
8 2395   Nor tender feeling, to base touches prone,
8 2396   Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited
8 2397   To any sensual feast with thee alone:
8 2398   But my five wits nor my five senses can
8 2399   Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,
8 2400   Who leaves unsway'd the likeness of a man,
8 2401   Thy proud heart's slave and vassal wretch to be:

8 2410   And thou shalt find it merits not reproving;
8 2411   Or, if it do, not from those lips of thine,
8 2412   That have profan'd their scarlet ornaments
8 2413   And seal'd false bonds of love as oft as mine,
8 2414   Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.
8 2415   Be it lawful I love thee, as thou lov'st those
8 2416   Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee:
8 2417   Root pity in thy heart, that, when it grows,
8 2418   Thy pity may deserve to pitied be.

8 2444   The worser spirit a woman colour'd ill.
8 2445   To win me soon to hell, my female evil,
8 2446   Tempteth my better angel from my side,
8 2447   And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,
8 2448   Wooing his purity with her foul pride.
8 2449   And whether that my angel be turn'd fiend,
8 2450   Suspect I may, yet not directly tell;
8 2451   But being both from me, both to each friend,
8 2452   I guess one angel in another's hell:

8 2461   But when she saw my woeful state,
8 2462   Straight in her heart did mercy come,
8 2463   Chiding that tongue that ever sweet
8 2464   Was us'd in giving gentle doom;
8 2465   And taught it thus anew to greet;
8 2466   'I hate' she alter'd with an end,
8 2467   That followed it as gentle day,
8 2468   Doth follow night, who like a fiend
8 2469   From heaven to hell is flown away.
8 2470     'I hate', from hate away she threw,

8 2483   Then soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss,
8 2484   And let that pine to aggravate thy store;
8 2485   Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;
8 2486   Within be fed, without be rich no more:

8 2496   My reason, the physician to my love,
8 2497   Angry that his prescriptions are not kept,

8 2499   Desire is death, which physic did except.
8 2500   Past cure I am, now Reason is past care,
8 2501   And frantic-mad with evermore unrest;
8 2502   My thoughts and my discourse as madmen's are,
8 2503   At random from the truth vainly express'd;

8 2512   That censures falsely what they see aright?
8 2513   If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,

8 2515   If it be not, then love doth well denote
8 2516   Love's eye is not so true as all men's: no,

8 2518   That is so vexed with watching and with tears?
8 2519   No marvel then, though I mistake my view;

8 2534   What merit do I in my self respect,
8 2535   That is so proud thy service to despise,
8 2536   When all my best doth worship thy defect,
8 2537   Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?
8 2538     But, love, hate on, for now I know thy mind;
8 2539     Those that can see thou lov'st, and I am blind.

8 2541   CL
8 2542 
8 2543   O! from what power hast thou this powerful might,
8 2544   With insufficiency my heart to sway?
8 2545   To make me give the lie to my true sight,
8 2546   And swear that brightness doth not grace the day?
8 2547   Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,
8 2548   That in the very refuse of thy deeds
8 2549   There is such strength and warrantise of skill,
8 2550   That, in my mind, thy worst all best exceeds?
8 2551   Who taught thee how to make me love thee more,
8 2552   The more I hear and see just cause of hate?
8 2553   O! though I love what others do abhor,
8 2554   With others thou shouldst not abhor my state:
8 2555     If thy unworthiness rais'd love in me,
8 2556     More worthy I to be belov'd of thee.

8 2558   CLI
8 2559 
8 2560   Love is too young to know what conscience is,
8 2561   Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?
8 2562   Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,
8 2563   Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove:
8 2564   For, thou betraying me, I do betray
8 2565   My nobler part to my gross body's treason;
8 2566   My soul doth tell my body that he may
8 2567   Triumph in love; flesh stays no farther reason,
8 2568   But rising at thy name doth point out thee,
8 2569   As his triumphant prize. Proud of this pride,
8 2570   He is contented thy poor drudge to be,
8 2571   To stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side.
8 2572     No want of conscience hold it that I call
8 2573     Her 'love,' for whose dear love I rise and fall.
8 2574 
8 2575   CLII
8 2576 
8 2577   In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,
8 2578   But thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing;
8 2579   In act thy bed-vow broke, and new faith torn,
8 2580   In vowing new hate after new love bearing:
8 2581   But why of two oaths' breach do I accuse thee,
8 2582   When I break twenty? I am perjur'd most;
8 2583   For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee,
8 2584   And all my honest faith in thee is lost:
8 2585   For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness,
8 2586   Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy;
8 2587   And, to enlighten thee, gave eyes to blindness,
8 2588   Or made them swear against the thing they see;
8 2589     For I have sworn thee fair; more perjur'd I,
8 2590     To swear against the truth so foul a lie!

8 2594   Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep:
8 2595   A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
8 2596   And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep
8 2597   In a cold valley-fountain of that ground;
8 2598   Which borrow'd from this holy fire of Love,
8 2599   A dateless lively heat, still to endure,
8 2600   And grew a seeting bath, which yet men prove
8 2601   Against strange maladies a sovereign cure.
8 2602   But at my mistress' eye Love's brand new-fired,
8 2603   The boy for trial needs would touch my breast;
8 2604   I, sick withal, the help of bath desired,
8 2605   And thither hied, a sad distemper'd guest,
8 2606     But found no cure, the bath for my help lies
8 2607     Where Cupid got new fire; my mistress' eyes.

8 2611   The little Love-god lying once asleep,
8 2612   Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
8 2613   Whilst many nymphs that vow'd chaste life to keep
8 2614   Came tripping by; but in her maiden hand
8 2615   The fairest votary took up that fire
8 2616   Which many legions of true hearts had warm'd;
8 2617   And so the general of hot desire
8 2618   Was, sleeping, by a virgin hand disarm'd.
8 2619   This brand she quenched in a cool well by,
8 2620   Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual,
8 2621   Growing a bath and healthful remedy,
8 2622   For men diseas'd; but I, my mistress' thrall,
8 2623     Came there for cure and this by that I prove,
8 2624     Love's fire heats water, water cools not love.

8 2682 Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
8 2683 electronic works
8 2684 
8 2685 1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
8 2686 electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
8 2687 and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
8 2688 (trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
8 2689 the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
8 2690 all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
8 2691 If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
8 2692 Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
8 2693 terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
8 2694 entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
8 2695 
8 2696 1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
8 2697 used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
8 2698 agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
8 2699 things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
8 2700 even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
8 2701 paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
8 2702 Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
8 2703 and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
8 2704 works.  See paragraph 1.E below.
8 2705 
8 2706 1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
8 2707 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
8 2708 Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
8 2709 collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
8 2710 individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
8 2711 located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
8 2712 copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
8 2713 works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
8 2714 are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
8 2715 Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
8 2716 freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
8 2717 this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
8 2718 the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
8 2719 keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
8 2720 Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.
8 2721 
8 2722 1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
8 2723 what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
8 2724 a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
8 2725 the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
8 2726 before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
8 2727 creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
8 2728 Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
8 2729 the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
8 2730 States.

8 2749 and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
8 2750 or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
8 2751 with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
8 2752 work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
8 2753 through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

8 2778 "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
8 2779 posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),

8 2795      the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
8 2796      you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
8 2797      owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
8 2798      has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
8 2799      Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
8 2800      must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
8 2801      prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
8 2802      returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and

8 2830 1.F.

8 2833 effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
8 2834 public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
8 2835 collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
8 2836 works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
8 2837 "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
8 2838 corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
8 2839 property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
8 2840 computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
8 2841 your equipment.

8 2843 1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
8 2844 of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
8 2845 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

8 2847 Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
8 2848 liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
8 2849 fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
8 2850 LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
8 2851 PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
8 2852 TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
8 2853 LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
8 2854 INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
8 2855 DAMAGE.

8 2857 1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
8 2858 defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
8 2859 receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
8 2860 written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
8 2861 received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
8 2862 your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
8 2863 the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
8 2864 refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
8 2865 providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
8 2866 receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
8 2867 is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
8 2868 opportunities to fix the problem.

8 2871 in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

8 2873 WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
8 2874 
8 2875 1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
8 2876 warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
8 2877 If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
8 2878 law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
8 2879 interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
8 2880 the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
8 2881 provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.
8 2882 
8 2883 1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
8 2884 trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
8 2885 providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
8 2886 with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
8 2887 promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
8 2888 harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
8 2889 that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
8 2890 or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
8 2891 work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
8 2892 Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.

8 2895 Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
8 2896 
8 2897 Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
8 2898 electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
8 2899 including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
8 2900 because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
8 2901 people in all walks of life.
8 2902 
8 2903 Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
8 2904 assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
8 2905 goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
8 2906 remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
8 2907 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
8 2908 and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

8 2937 Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
8 2938 Literary Archive Foundation
8 2939 
8 2940 Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
8 2941 spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
8 2942 increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
8 2943 freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
8 2944 array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
8 2945 ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
8 2946 status with the IRS.
8 2947 
8 2948 The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
8 2949 charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
8 2950 States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
8 2951 considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
8 2952 with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
8 2953 where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
8 2954 SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
8 2955 particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate
8 2956 
8 2957 While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
8 2958 have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
8 2959 against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
8 2960 approach us with offers to donate.
8 2961 
8 2962 International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
8 2963 any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
8 2964 outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
8 2965 
8 2966 Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
8 2967 methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
8 2968 ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

8 2972 Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
8 2973 works.
8 2974 
8 2975 Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
8 2976 concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
8 2977 with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
8 2978 Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
8 2979 
8 2980 Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
8 2981 editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
8 2982 unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
8 2983 keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
