14 26 Lords, Priests, Sailors, Officers, Musicians, and other

14 29 SCENE: A City in Illyria; and the Sea-coast near it.
14 30 
14 31 
14 32 
14 33 ACT I.
14 34 
14 35 SCENE I. An Apartment in the DUKE'S Palace.
14 36 
14 37 [Enter DUKE, CURIO, Lords; Musicians attending.]
14 38 
14 39 DUKE.
14 40 If music be the food of love, play on,
14 41 Give me excess of it; that, surfeiting,
14 42 The appetite may sicken and so die.--
14 43 That strain again;--it had a dying fall;
14 44 O, it came o'er my ear like the sweet south,
14 45 That breathes upon a bank of violets,
14 46 Stealing and giving odour.--Enough; no more;
14 47 'Tis not so sweet now as it was before.
14 48 O spirit of love, how quick and fresh art thou!
14 49 That, notwithstanding thy capacity
14 50 Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,
14 51 Of what validity and pitch soever,
14 52 But falls into abatement and low price
14 53 Even in a minute! so full of shapes is fancy,
14 54 That it alone is high-fantastical.
14 55 
14 56 CURIO.
14 57 Will you go hunt, my lord?
14 58 
14 59 DUKE.
14 60 What, Curio?
14 61 
14 62 CURIO.
14 63 The hart.
14 64 
14 65 DUKE.
14 66 Why, so I do, the noblest that I have:
14 67 O, when mine eyes did see Olivia first,
14 68 Methought she purg'd the air of pestilence;
14 69 That instant was I turn'd into a hart;
14 70 And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds,
14 71 E'er since pursue me.--How now! what news from her?
14 72 
14 73 [Enter VALENTINE.]
14 74 
14 75 VALENTINE.
14 76 So please my lord, I might not be admitted,
14 77 But from her handmaid do return this answer:
14 78 The element itself, till seven years' heat,
14 79 Shall not behold her face at ample view;
14 80 But like a cloistress she will veiled walk,
14 81 And water once a-day her chamber round
14 82 With eye-offending brine: all this to season
14 83 A brother's dead love, which she would keep fresh
14 84 And lasting in her sad remembrance.
14 85 
14 86 DUKE.
14 87 O, she that hath a heart of that fine frame
14 88 To pay this debt of love but to a brother,
14 89 How will she love when the rich golden shaft
14 90 Hath kill'd the flock of all affections else
14 91 That live in her; when liver, brain, and heart,
14 92 These sovereign thrones, are all supplied and fill'd,--
14 93 Her sweet perfections,--with one self king!--
14 94 Away before me to sweet beds of flowers:
14 95 Love-thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers.
14 96 
14 97 [Exeunt.]
14 98 
14 99 
14 100 
14 101 SCENE II. The sea-coast.
14 102 
14 103 [Enter VIOLA, CAPTAIN, and Sailors.]
14 104 
14 105 VIOLA.
14 106 What country, friends, is this?
14 107 
14 108 CAPTAIN.
14 109 This is Illyria, lady.
14 110 
14 111 VIOLA.
14 112 And what should I do in Illyria?
14 113 My brother he is in Elysium.
14 114 Perchance he is not drown'd--What think you, sailors?
14 115 
14 116 CAPTAIN.
14 117 It is perchance that you yourself were sav'd.
14 118 
14 119 VIOLA.
14 120 O my poor brother! and so perchance may he be.
14 121 
14 122 CAPTAIN.
14 123 True, madam; and, to comfort you with chance,
14 124 Assure yourself, after our ship did split,
14 125 When you, and those poor number sav'd with you,
14 126 Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,
14 127 Most provident in peril, bind himself,---
14 128 Courage and hope both teaching him the practice,--
14 129 To a strong mast that liv'd upon the sea;
14 130 Where, like Arion on the dolphin's back,
14 131 I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves
14 132 So long as I could see.
14 133 
14 134 VIOLA.
14 135 For saying so, there's gold!
14 136 Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,
14 137 Whereto thy speech serves for authority,
14 138 The like of him. Know'st thou this country?
14 139 
14 140 CAPTAIN.
14 141 Ay, madam, well; for I was bred and born
14 142 Not three hours' travel from this very place.
14 143 
14 144 VIOLA.
14 145 Who governs here?
14 146 
14 147 CAPTAIN.
14 148 A noble duke, in nature
14 149 As in name.
14 150 
14 151 VIOLA.
14 152 What is his name?
14 153 
14 154 CAPTAIN.
14 155 Orsino.
14 156 
14 157 VIOLA.
14 158 Orsino! I have heard my father name him.
14 159 He was a bachelor then.
14 160 
14 161 CAPTAIN.
14 162 And so is now,
14 163 Or was so very late; for but a month
14 164 Ago I went from hence; and then 'twas fresh
14 165 In murmur,--as, you know, what great ones do,
14 166 The less will prattle of,--that he did seek
14 167 The love of fair Olivia.
14 168 
14 169 VIOLA.
14 170 What's she?
14 171 
14 172 CAPTAIN.
14 173 A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count
14 174 That died some twelvemonth since; then leaving her
14 175 In the protection of his son, her brother,
14 176 Who shortly also died; for whose dear love,
14 177 They say, she hath abjured the company
14 178 And sight of men.
14 179 
14 180 VIOLA.
14 181 O that I served that lady!
14 182 And might not be delivered to the world,
14 183 Till I had made mine own occasion mellow,
14 184 What my estate is.
14 185 
14 186 CAPTAIN.
14 187 That were hard to compass:
14 188 Because she will admit no kind of suit,
14 189 No, not the duke's.
14 190 
14 191 VIOLA.
14 192 There is a fair behaviour in thee, captain;
14 193 And though that nature with a beauteous wall
14 194 Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee
14 195 I will believe thou hast a mind that suits
14 196 With this thy fair and outward character.
14 197 I pray thee, and I'll pay thee bounteously,
14 198 Conceal me what I am; and be my aid
14 199 For such disguise as, haply, shall become
14 200 The form of my intent. I'll serve this duke;
14 201 Thou shalt present me as an eunuch to him;
14 202 It may be worth thy pains, for I can sing,
14 203 And speak to him in many sorts of music,
14 204 That will allow me very worth his service.
14 205 What else may hap to time I will commit;
14 206 Only shape thou silence to my wit.
14 207 
14 208 CAPTAIN.
14 209 Be you his eunuch and your mute I'll be;
14 210 When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.
14 211 
14 212 VIOLA.
14 213 I thank thee. Lead me on.
14 214 
14 215 [Exeunt.]
14 216 
14 217 
14 218 
14 219 SCENE III. A Room in OLIVIA'S House.
14 220 
14 221 [Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and MARIA.]
14 222 
14 223 SIR TOBY.
14 224 What a plague means my niece, to take the death of her
14 225 brother thus? I am sure care's an enemy to life.
14 226 
14 227 MARIA.
14 228 By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o' nights;
14 229 your cousin, my lady, takes great exceptions to your ill hours.
14 230 
14 231 SIR TOBY.
14 232 Why, let her except, before excepted.
14 233 
14 234 MARIA.
14 235 Ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest limits
14 236 of order.
14 237 
14 238 SIR TOBY.
14 239 Confine? I'll confine myself no finer than I am: these
14 240 clothes are good enough to drink in, and so be these boots too;
14 241 an they be not, let them hang themselves in their own straps.
14 242 
14 243 MARIA.
14 244 That quaffing and drinking will undo you: I heard my lady
14 245 talk of it yesterday; and of a foolish knight that you brought in
14 246 one night here to be her wooer.
14 247 
14 248 SIR TOBY.
14 249 Who? Sir Andrew Ague-cheek?
14 250 
14 251 MARIA.
14 252 Ay, he.
14 253 
14 254 SIR TOBY.
14 255 He's as tall a man as any's in Illyria.
14 256 
14 257 MARIA.
14 258 What's that to the purpose?
14 259 
14 260 SIR TOBY.
14 261 Why, he has three thousand ducats a year.
14 262 
14 263 MARIA.
14 264 Ay, but he'll have but a year in all these ducats; he's a
14 265 very fool, and a prodigal.
14 266 
14 267 SIR TOBY.
14 268 Fye that you'll say so! he plays o' the viol-de-gambo,
14 269 and speaks three or four languages word for word without book,
14 270 and hath all the good gifts of nature.
14 271 
14 272 MARIA.
14 273 He hath indeed,--almost natural: for, besides that he's a
14 274 fool, he's a great quarreller; and, but that he hath the gift of
14 275 a coward to allay the gust he hath in quarrelling, 'tis thought
14 276 among the prudent he would quickly have the gift of a grave.
14 277 
14 278 SIR TOBY.
14 279 By this hand, they are scoundrels and subtractors that
14 280 say so of him. Who are they?
14 281 
14 282 MARIA.
14 283 They that add, moreover, he's drunk nightly in your company.
14 284 
14 285 SIR TOBY.
14 286 With drinking healths to my niece; I'll drink to her as
14 287 long as there is a passage in my throat and drink in Illyria.
14 288 He's a coward and a coystril that will not drink to my niece
14 289 till his brains turn o' the toe like a parish-top. What, wench!
14 290 Castiliano-vulgo! for here comes Sir Andrew Ague-face.
14 291 
14 292 [Enter SIR ANDREW AGUE-CHEEK.]
14 293 
14 294 AGUE-CHEEK.
14 295 Sir Toby Belch! how now, Sir Toby Belch!
14 296 
14 297 SIR TOBY.
14 298 Sweet Sir Andrew?
14 299 
14 300 SIR ANDREW.
14 301 Bless you, fair shrew.
14 302 
14 303 MARIA.
14 304 And you too, sir.
14 305 
14 306 SIR TOBY.
14 307 Accost, Sir Andrew, accost.
14 308 
14 309 SIR ANDREW.
14 310 What's that?
14 311 
14 312 SIR TOBY.
14 313 My niece's chamber-maid.
14 314 
14 315 SIR ANDREW.
14 316 Good Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance.
14 317 
14 318 MARIA.
14 319 My name is Mary, sir.
14 320 
14 321 SIR ANDREW.
14 322 Good Mistress Mary Accost,--
14 323 
14 324 SIR TOBY.
14 325 You mistake, knight: accost is, front her, board her,
14 326 woo her, assail her.
14 327 
14 328 SIR ANDREW.
14 329 By my troth, I would not undertake her in this company.
14 330 Is that the meaning of accost?
14 331 
14 332 MARIA.
14 333 Fare you well, gentlemen.
14 334 
14 335 SIR TOBY.
14 336 An thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst never
14 337 draw sword again.
14 338 
14 339 SIR ANDREW.
14 340 An you part so, mistress, I would I might never draw
14 341 sword again. Fair lady, do you think you have fools in hand?
14 342 
14 343 MARIA.
14 344 Sir, I have not you by the hand.
14 345 
14 346 SIR ANDREW.
14 347 Marry, but you shall have; and here's my hand.
14 348 
14 349 MARIA.
14 350 Now, sir, thought is free. I pray you, bring your hand to
14 351 the buttery-bar and let it drink.
14 352 
14 353 SIR ANDREW.
14 354 Wherefore, sweetheart? what's your metaphor?
14 355 
14 356 MARIA.
14 357 It's dry, sir.
14 358 
14 359 SIR ANDREW.
14 360 Why, I think so; I am not such an ass but I can keep my
14 361 hand dry. But what's your jest?
14 362 
14 363 MARIA.
14 364 A dry jest, sir.
14 365 
14 366 SIR ANDREW.
14 367 Are you full of them?
14 368 
14 369 MARIA.
14 370 Ay, sir, I have them at my fingers' ends: marry, now I let
14 371 go your hand I am barren.
14 372 
14 373 [Exit MARIA.]
14 374 
14 375 SIR TOBY.
14 376 O knight, thou lack'st a cup of canary: When did I see
14 377 thee so put down?
14 378 
14 379 SIR ANDREW.
14 380 Never in your life, I think; unless you see canary put
14 381 me down. Methinks sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian
14 382 or an ordinary man has; but I am great eater of beef, and, I
14 383 believe, that does harm to my wit.
14 384 
14 385 SIR TOBY.
14 386 No question.
14 387 
14 388 SIR ANDREW.
14 389 An I thought that, I'd forswear it. I'll ride home
14 390 to-morrow, Sir Toby.
14 391 
14 392 SIR TOBY.
14 393 Pourquoy, my dear knight?
14 394 
14 395 SIR ANDREW.
14 396 What is pourquoy? do or not do? I would I had bestowed
14 397 that time in the tongues that I have in fencing, dancing, and
14 398 bear-baiting. Oh, had I but followed the arts!
14 399 
14 400 SIR TOBY.
14 401 Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.
14 402 
14 403 SIR ANDREW.
14 404 Why, would that have mended my hair?
14 405 
14 406 SIR TOBY.
14 407 Past question; for thou seest it will not curl by nature.
14 408 
14 409 SIR ANDREW.
14 410 But it becomes me well enough, does't not?
14 411 
14 412 SIR TOBY.
14 413 Excellent; it hangs like flax on a distaff; and I hope to
14 414 see a houswife take thee between her legs and spin it off.
14 415 
14 416 SIR ANDREW.
14 417 Faith, I'll home to-morrow, Sir Toby; your niece will
14 418 not be seen; or, if she be, it's four to one she'll none of me;
14 419 the count himself here hard by woos her.
14 420 
14 421 SIR TOBY.
14 422 She'll none o' the Count; she'll not match above her
14 423 degree, neither in estate, years, nor wit; I have heard her
14 424 swear't. Tut, there's life in't, man.
14 425 
14 426 SIR ANDREW.
14 427 I'll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o' the strangest
14 428 mind i' the world; I delight in masques and revels sometimes
14 429 altogether.
14 430 
14 431 SIR TOBY.
14 432 Art thou good at these kick-shaws, knight?
14 433 
14 434 SIR ANDREW.
14 435 As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be, under the
14 436 degree of my betters; and yet I will not compare with an old man.
14 437 
14 438 SIR TOBY.
14 439 What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?
14 440 
14 441 SIR ANDREW.
14 442 Faith, I can cut a caper.
14 443 
14 444 SIR TOBY.
14 445 And I can cut the mutton to't.
14 446 
14 447 SIR ANDREW.
14 448 And, I think, I have the back-trick simply as strong as
14 449 any man in Illyria.
14 450 
14 451 SIR TOBY.
14 452 Wherefore are these things hid? wherefore have these
14 453 gifts a curtain before them? are they like to take dust, like
14 454 Mistress Mall's picture? why dost thou not go to church in a
14 455 galliard and come home in a coranto? My very walk should be a
14 456 jig; I would not so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace. What
14 457 dost thou mean? is it a world to hide virtues in? I did think, by
14 458 the excellent constitution of thy leg, it was formed under the
14 459 star of a galliard.
14 460 
14 461 SIR ANDREW.
14 462 Ay, 'tis strong, and it does indifferent well in
14 463 flame-colour'd stock. Shall we set about some revels?
14 464 
14 465 SIR TOBY.
14 466 What shall we do else? were we not born under Taurus?
14 467 
14 468 SIR ANDREW.
14 469 Taurus? that's sides and heart.
14 470 
14 471 SIR TOBY.
14 472 No, sir; it is legs and thighs. Let me see thee caper: ha,
14 473 higher: ha, ha!--excellent!
14 474 
14 475 [Exeunt.]
14 476 
14 477 
14 478 
14 479 SCENE IV. A Room in the DUKE'S Palace.
14 480 
14 481 [Enter VALENTINE, and VIOLA in man's attire.]
14 482 
14 483 VALENTINE.
14 484 If the duke continue these favours towards you, Cesario,
14 485 you are like to be much advanced; he hath known you but three
14 486 days, and already you are no stranger.
14 487 
14 488 VIOLA.
14 489 You either fear his humour or my negligence, that you call
14 490 in question the continuance of his love. Is he inconstant, sir,
14 491 in his favours?
14 492 
14 493 VALENTINE.
14 494 No, believe me.
14 495 
14 496 [Enter DUKE, CURIO, and Attendants.]
14 497 
14 498 VIOLA.
14 499 I thank you. Here comes the count.
14 500 
14 501 DUKE.
14 502 Who saw Cesario, ho?
14 503 
14 504 VIOLA.
14 505 On your attendance, my lord; here.
14 506 
14 507 DUKE.
14 508 Stand you awhile aloof.--Cesario,
14 509 Thou know'st no less but all; I have unclasp'd
14 510 To thee the book even of my secret soul:
14 511 Therefore, good youth, address thy gait unto her;
14 512 Be not denied access, stand at her doors,
14 513 And tell them there thy fixed foot shall grow
14 514 Till thou have audience.
14 515 
14 516 VIOLA.
14 517 Sure, my noble lord,
14 518 If she be so abandon'd to her sorrow
14 519 As it is spoke, she never will admit me.
14 520 
14 521 DUKE.
14 522 Be clamorous and leap all civil bounds,
14 523 Rather than make unprofited return.
14 524 
14 525 VIOLA.
14 526 Say I do speak with her, my lord. What then?
14 527 
14 528 DUKE.
14 529 O, then unfold the passion of my love,
14 530 Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith:
14 531 It shall become thee well to act my woes;
14 532 She will attend it better in thy youth
14 533 Than in a nuncio of more grave aspect.
14 534 
14 535 VIOLA.
14 536 I think not so, my lord.
14 537 
14 538 DUKE.
14 539 Dear lad, believe it,
14 540 For they shall yet belie thy happy years
14 541 That say thou art a man: Diana's lip
14 542 Is not more smooth and rubious; thy small pipe
14 543 Is as the maiden's organ, shrill and sound,
14 544 And all is semblative a woman's part.
14 545 I know thy constellation is right apt
14 546 For this affair:--some four or five attend him:
14 547 All, if you will; for I myself am best
14 548 When least in company:--prosper well in this,
14 549 And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord,
14 550 To call his fortunes thine.
14 551 
14 552 VIOLA.
14 553 I'll do my best
14 554 To woo your lady. [Aside] Yet, a barful strife!
14 555 Whoe'er I woo, myself would be his wife.
14 556 
14 557 
14 558 
14 559 SCENE V. A Room in OLIVIA'S House.
14 560 
14 561 [Enter MARIA and CLOWN.]
14 562 
14 563 MARIA.
14 564 Nay; either tell me where thou hast been, or I will not open
14 565 my lips so wide as a bristle may enter in way of thy excuse: my
14 566 lady will hang thee for thy absence.
14 567 
14 568 CLOWN.
14 569 Let her hang me: he that is well hanged in this world needs
14 570 to fear no colours.
14 571 
14 572 MARIA.
14 573 Make that good.
14 574 
14 575 CLOWN.
14 576 He shall see none to fear.
14 577 
14 578 MARIA.
14 579 A good lenten answer: I can tell thee where that saying was
14 580 born, of, I fear no colours.
14 581 
14 582 CLOWN.
14 583 Where, good Mistress Mary?
14 584 
14 585 MARIA.
14 586 In the wars; and that may you be bold to say in your foolery.
14 587 
14 588 CLOWN.
14 589 Well, God give them wisdom that have it; and those that are
14 590 fools, let them use their talents.
14 591 
14 592 MARIA.
14 593 Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent: or to be
14 594 turned away; is not that as good as a hanging to you?
14 595 
14 596 CLOWN.
14 597 Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage; and for turning
14 598 away, let summer bear it out.
14 599 
14 600 MARIA.
14 601 You are resolute, then?
14 602 
14 603 CLOWN.
14 604 Not so, neither: but I am resolved on two points.
14 605 
14 606 MARIA.
14 607 That if one break, the other will hold; or if both break,
14 608 your gaskins fall.
14 609 
14 610 CLOWN.
14 611 Apt, in good faith, very apt! Well, go thy way; if Sir Toby
14 612 would leave drinking, thou wert as witty a piece of Eve's flesh
14 613 as any in Illyria.
14 614 
14 615 MARIA.
14 616 Peace, you rogue; no more o' that; here comes my lady: make
14 617 your excuse wisely; you were best.
14 618 
14 619 [Exit.]
14 620 
14 621 [Enter OLIVIA and MALVOLIO.]
14 622 
14 623 CLOWN.
14 624 Wit, and't be thy will, put me into good fooling! Those wits
14 625 that think they have thee do very oft prove fools; and I, that am
14 626 sure I lack thee, may pass for a wise man. For what says
14 627 Quinapalus? Better a witty fool than a foolish wit.--God bless
14 628 thee, lady!
14 629 
14 630 OLIVIA.
14 631 Take the fool away.
14 632 
14 633 CLOWN.
14 634 Do you not hear, fellows? Take away the lady.
14 635 
14 636 OLIVIA.
14 637 Go to, you're a dry fool; I'll no more of you: besides, you
14 638 grow dishonest.
14 639 
14 640 CLOWN.
14 641 Two faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel will amend:
14 642 for give the dry fool drink, then is the fool not dry; bid the
14 643 dishonest man mend himself: if he mend, he is no longer
14 644 dishonest; if he cannot, let the botcher mend him. Anything
14 645 that's mended is but patched; virtue that transgresses is but
14 646 patched with sin, and sin that amends is but patched with virtue.
14 647 If that this simple syllogism will serve, so; if it will not,
14 648 what remedy? As there is no true cuckold but calamity, so
14 649 beauty's a flower:--the lady bade take away the fool; therefore,
14 650 I say again, take her away.
14 651 
14 652 OLIVIA.
14 653 Sir, I bade them take away you.
14 654 
14 655 CLOWN.
14 656 Misprision in the highest degree!--Lady, Cucullus non facit
14 657 monachum; that's as much to say, I wear not motley in my
14 658 brain. Good madonna, give me leave to prove you a fool.
14 659 
14 660 OLIVIA.
14 661 Can you do it?
14 662 
14 663 CLOWN.
14 664 Dexteriously, good madonna.
14 665 
14 666 OLIVIA.
14 667 Make your proof.
14 668 
14 669 CLOWN.
14 670 I must catechize you for it, madonna.
14 671 Good my mouse of virtue, answer me.
14 672 
14 673 OLIVIA.
14 674 Well, sir, for want of other idleness, I'll 'bide your proof.
14 675 
14 676 CLOWN.
14 677 Good madonna, why mourn'st thou?
14 678 
14 679 OLIVIA.
14 680 Good fool, for my brother's death.
14 681 
14 682 CLOWN.
14 683 I think his soul is in hell, madonna.
14 684 
14 685 OLIVIA.
14 686 I know his soul is in heaven, fool.
14 687 
14 688 CLOWN.
14 689 The more fool you, madonna, to mourn for your brother's soul
14 690 being in heaven.--Take away the fool, gentlemen.
14 691 
14 692 OLIVIA.
14 693 What think you of this fool, Malvolio? doth he not mend?
14 694 
14 695 MALVOLIO.
14 696 Yes; and shall do, till the pangs of death shake him.
14 697 Infirmity, that decays the wise, doth ever make the better fool.
14 698 
14 699 CLOWN.
14 700 God send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the better
14 701 increasing your folly! Sir Toby will be sworn that I am no fox;
14 702 but he will not pass his word for twopence that you are no fool.
14 703 
14 704 OLIVIA.
14 705 How say you to that, Malvolio?
14 706 
14 707 MALVOLIO.
14 708 I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a barren
14 709 rascal; I saw him put down the other day with an ordinary fool
14 710 that has no more brain than a stone. Look you now, he's out of
14 711 his guard already; unless you laugh and minister occasion to him,
14 712 
14 713 he is gagged. I protest I take these wise men that crow so at
14 714 these set kind of fools, no better than the fools' zanies.
14 715 
14 716 OLIVIA.
14 717 O, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste with a
14 718 distempered appetite. To be generous, guiltless, and of free
14 719 disposition, is to take those things for bird-bolts that you deem
14 720 cannon bullets. There is no slander in an allowed fool, though he
14 721 do nothing but rail; nor no railing in known discreet man, though
14 722 he do nothing but reprove.
14 723 
14 724 CLOWN.
14 725 Now Mercury endue thee with leasing, for thou speakest well of
14 726 fools!
14 727 
14 728 [Re-enter MARIA.]
14 729 
14 730 MARIA.
14 731 Madam, there is at the gate a young gentleman much desires
14 732 to speak with you.
14 733 
14 734 OLIVIA.
14 735 From the Count Orsino, is it?
14 736 
14 737 MARIA.
14 738 I know not, madam; 'tis a fair young man, and well attended.
14 739 
14 740 OLIVIA.
14 741 Who of my people hold him in delay?
14 742 
14 743 MARIA.
14 744 Sir Toby, madam, your kinsman.
14 745 
14 746 OLIVIA.
14 747 Fetch him off, I pray you; he speaks nothing but madman.
14 748 Fie on him!
14 749 
14 750 [Exit MARIA]
14 751 
14 752 Go you, Malvolio: if it be a suit from the count, I am sick, or
14 753 not at home; what you will to dismiss it.
14 754 
14 755 [Exit MALVOLIO.]
14 756 
14 757 Now you see, sir, how your fooling grows old, and people dislike
14 758 it.
14 759 
14 760 CLOWN.
14 761 Thou hast spoke for us, madonna, as if thy eldest son should
14 762 be a fool: whose skull Jove cram with brains, for here he comes--
14 763 one of thy kin, has a most weak pia mater.
14 764 
14 765 [Enter SIR TOBY BELCH.]
14 766 
14 767 OLIVIA.
14 768 By mine honour, half drunk!--What is he at the gate, cousin?
14 769 
14 770 SIR TOBY.
14 771 A gentleman.
14 772 
14 773 OLIVIA.
14 774 A gentleman? What gentleman?
14 775 
14 776 SIR TOBY.
14 777 'Tis a gentleman here.--A plague o' these pickle-herrings!--How
14 778 now, sot?
14 779 
14 780 CLOWN.
14 781 Good Sir Toby,--
14 782 
14 783 OLIVIA.
14 784 Cousin, cousin, how have you come so early by this lethargy?
14 785 
14 786 SIR TOBY.
14 787 Lechery! I defy lechery. There's one at the gate.
14 788 
14 789 OLIVIA.
14 790 Ay, marry; what is he?
14 791 
14 792 SIR TOBY.
14 793 Let him be the devil an he will, I care not: give me
14 794 faith, say I. Well, it's all one.
14 795 
14 796 [Exit.]
14 797 
14 798 OLIVIA.
14 799 What's a drunken man like, fool?
14 800 
14 801 CLOWN.
14 802 Like a drowned man, a fool, and a madman: one draught above
14 803 heat makes him a fool; the second mads him; and a third drowns
14 804 him.
14 805 
14 806 OLIVIA.
14 807 Go thou and seek the coroner, and let him sit o' my coz;
14 808 for he's in the third degree of drink; he's drowned: go, look
14 809 after him.
14 810 
14 811 CLOWN.
14 812 He is but mad yet, madonna; and the fool shall look to the
14 813 madman.
14 814 
14 815 [Exit CLOWN.]
14 816 
14 817 [Re-enter MALVOLIO.]
14 818 
14 819 MALVOLIO.
14 820 Madam, yond young fellow swears he will speak with you. I
14 821 told him you were sick; he takes on him to understand so much,
14 822  and therefore comes to speak with you; I told him you were
14 823 asleep; he seems to have a foreknowledge of that too, and
14 824 therefore comes to speak with you. What is to be said to him,
14 825 lady? he's fortified against any denial.
14 826 
14 827 OLIVIA.
14 828 Tell him, he shall not speak with me.
14 829 
14 830 MALVOLIO.
14 831 Has been told so; and he says he'll stand at your door
14 832 like a sheriff's post, and be the supporter of a bench, but he'll
14 833 speak with you.
14 834 
14 835 OLIVIA.
14 836 What kind of man is he?
14 837 
14 838 MALVOLIO.
14 839 Why, of mankind.
14 840 
14 841 OLIVIA.
14 842 What manner of man?
14 843 
14 844 MALVOLIO.
14 845 Of very ill manner; he'll speak with you, will you or no.
14 846 
14 847 OLIVIA.
14 848 Of what personage and years is he?
14 849 
14 850 MALVOLIO.
14 851 Not yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for a boy;
14 852 as a squash is before 'tis a peascod, or a codling, when 'tis
14 853 almost an apple: 'tis with him e'en standing water, between boy
14 854 and man. He is very well-favoured, and he speaks very shrewishly;
14 855 one would think his mother's milk were scarce out of him.
14 856 
14 857 OLIVIA.
14 858 Let him approach. Call in my gentlewoman.
14 859 
14 860 MALVOLIO.
14 861 Gentlewoman, my lady calls.
14 862 
14 863 [Exit.]
14 864 
14 865 [Re-enter MARIA.]
14 866 
14 867 OLIVIA.
14 868 Give me my veil; come, throw it o'er my face;
14 869 We'll once more hear Orsino's embassy.
14 870 
14 871 [Enter VIOLA.]
14 872 
14 873 VIOLA.
14 874 The honourable lady of the house, which is she?
14 875 
14 876 OLIVIA.
14 877 Speak to me; I shall answer for her. Your will?
14 878 
14 879 VIOLA.
14 880 Most radiant, exquisite, and unmatchable beauty,--I pray you,
14 881 tell me if this be the lady of the house, for I never saw her: I
14 882 would be loath to cast away my speech; for, besides that it is
14 883 excellently well penned, I have taken great pains to con it. Good
14 884 beauties, let me sustain no scorn; I am very comptible, even to
14 885 the least sinister usage.
14 886 
14 887 OLIVIA.
14 888 Whence came you, sir?
14 889 
14 890 VIOLA.
14 891 I can say little more than I have studied, and that
14 892 question's out of my part. Good gentle one, give me modest
14 893 assurance, if you be the lady of the house, that I may proceed in
14 894 my speech.
14 895 
14 896 OLIVIA.
14 897 Are you a comedian?
14 898 
14 899 VIOLA.
14 900 No, my profound heart: and yet, by the very fangs of malice
14 901 I swear, I am not that I play. Are you the lady of the house?
14 902 
14 903 OLIVIA.
14 904 If I do not usurp myself, I am.
14 905 
14 906 VIOLA.
14 907 Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp yourself; for
14 908 what is yours to bestow is not yours to reserve. But this is from
14 909 my commission: I will on with my speech in your praise, and then
14 910 show you the heart of my message.
14 911 
14 912 OLIVIA.
14 913 Come to what is important in't: I forgive you the praise.
14 914 
14 915 VIOLA.
14 916 Alas, I took great pains to study it, and 'tis poetical.
14 917 
14 918 OLIVIA.
14 919 It is the more like to be feigned; I pray you keep it in. I
14 920 heard you were saucy at my gates; and allowed your approach,
14 921 rather to wonder at you than to hear you. If you be not mad, be
14 922 gone; if you have reason, be brief: 'tis not that time of moon
14 923 with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue.
14 924 
14 925 MARIA.
14 926 Will you hoist sail, sir? here lies your way.
14 927 
14 928 VIOLA.
14 929 No, good swabber; I am to hull here a little longer.--
14 930 Some mollification for your giant, sweet lady.
14 931 
14 932 OLIVIA.
14 933 Tell me your mind.
14 934 
14 935 VIOLA.
14 936 I am a messenger.
14 937 
14 938 OLIVIA.
14 939 Sure, you have some hideous matter to deliver, when the
14 940 courtesy of it is so fearful. Speak your office.
14 941 
14 942 VIOLA.
14 943 It alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture of war, no
14 944 taxation of homage; I hold the olive in my hand: my words are as
14 945 full of peace as matter.
14 946 
14 947 OLIVIA.
14 948 Yet you began rudely. What are you? what would you?
14 949 
14 950 VIOLA.
14 951 The rudeness that hath appeared in me have I learned from my
14 952 entertainment. What I am and what I would are as secret as
14 953 maidenhead: to your ears, divinity; to any other's, profanation.
14 954 
14 955 OLIVIA.
14 956 Give us the place alone: we will hear this divinity.
14 957 
14 958 [Exit MARIA.]
14 959 
14 960 Now, sir, what is your text?
14 961 
14 962 VIOLA.
14 963 Most sweet lady,--
14 964 
14 965 OLIVIA.
14 966 A comfortable doctrine, and much may be said of it.
14 967 Where lies your text?
14 968 
14 969 VIOLA.
14 970 In Orsino's bosom.
14 971 
14 972 OLIVIA.
14 973 In his bosom? In what chapter of his bosom?
14 974 
14 975 VIOLA.
14 976 To answer by the method, in the first of his heart.
14 977 
14 978 OLIVIA.
14 979 O, I have read it; it is heresy. Have you no more to say?
14 980 
14 981 VIOLA.
14 982 Good madam, let me see your face.
14 983 
14 984 OLIVIA.
14 985 Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate with my
14 986 face? you are now out of your text: but we will draw the curtain
14 987 and show you the picture. Look you, sir, such a one I was this
14 988 present. Is't not well done?
14 989 
14 990 [Unveiling.]
14 991 
14 992 VIOLA.
14 993 Excellently done, if God did all.
14 994 
14 995 OLIVIA.
14 996 'Tis in grain, sir; 'twill endure wind and weather.
14 997 
14 998 VIOLA.
14 999 'Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and white
14 1000 Nature's own sweet and cunning hand laid on:
14 1001 Lady, you are the cruel'st she alive,
14 1002 If you will lead these graces to the grave,
14 1003 And leave the world no copy.
14 1004 
14 1005 OLIVIA.
14 1006 O, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted; I will give out
14 1007 divers schedules of my beauty. It shall be inventoried; and every
14 1008 particle and utensil labelled to my will: as, item, two lips
14 1009 indifferent red; item, two grey eyes with lids to them; item, one
14 1010 neck, one chin, and so forth. Were you sent hither to praise me?
14 1011 
14 1012 VIOLA.
14 1013 I see you what you are: you are too proud;
14 1014 But, if you were the devil, you are fair.
14 1015 My lord and master loves you. O, such love
14 1016 Could be but recompens'd though you were crown'd
14 1017 The nonpareil of beauty!
14 1018 
14 1019 OLIVIA.
14 1020 How does he love me?
14 1021 
14 1022 VIOLA.
14 1023 With adorations, fertile tears,
14 1024 With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire.
14 1025 
14 1026 OLIVIA.
14 1027 Your lord does know my mind; I cannot love him:
14 1028 Yet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble,
14 1029 Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth;
14 1030 In voices well divulged, free, learn'd, and valiant,
14 1031 And, in dimension and the shape of nature,
14 1032 A gracious person: but yet I cannot love him;
14 1033 He might have took his answer long ago.
14 1034 
14 1035 VIOLA.
14 1036 If I did love you in my master's flame,
14 1037 With such a suffering, such a deadly life,
14 1038 In your denial I would find no sense,
14 1039 I would not understand it.
14 1040 
14 1041 OLIVIA.
14 1042 Why, what would you?
14 1043 
14 1044 VIOLA.
14 1045 Make me a willow cabin at your gate,
14 1046 And call upon my soul within the house;
14 1047 Write loyal cantons of contemned love,
14 1048 And sing them loud, even in the dead of night;
14 1049 Holla your name to the reverberate hills,
14 1050 And make the babbling gossip of the air
14 1051 Cry out Olivia! O, you should not rest
14 1052 Between the elements of air and earth,
14 1053 But you should pity me.
14 1054 
14 1055 OLIVIA.
14 1056 You might do much. What is your parentage?
14 1057 
14 1058 VIOLA.
14 1059 Above my fortunes, yet my state is well: I am a gentleman.
14 1060 
14 1061 OLIVIA.
14 1062 Get you to your lord;
14 1063 I cannot love him: let him send no more;
14 1064 Unless, perchance, you come to me again,
14 1065 To tell me how he takes it. Fare you well:
14 1066 I thank you for your pains: spend this for me.
14 1067 
14 1068 VIOLA.
14 1069 I am no fee'd post, lady; keep your purse;
14 1070 My master, not myself, lacks recompense.
14 1071 Love make his heart of flint that you shall love;
14 1072 And let your fervour, like my master's, be
14 1073 Placed in contempt! Farewell, fair cruelty.
14 1074 
14 1075 [Exit.]
14 1076 
14 1077 OLIVIA.
14 1078 What is your parentage?
14 1079 'Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:
14 1080 I am a gentleman.'--I'll be sworn thou art;
14 1081 Thy tongue, thy face, thy limbs, actions, and spirit,
14 1082 Do give thee five-fold blazon. Not too fast:--soft, soft!
14 1083 Unless the master were the man.--How now?
14 1084 Even so quickly may one catch the plague?
14 1085 Methinks I feel this youth's perfections
14 1086 With an invisible and subtle stealth
14 1087 To creep in at mine eyes. Well, let it be.--
14 1088 What, ho, Malvolio!--
14 1089 
14 1090 [Re-enter MALVOLIO.]
14 1091 
14 1092 MALVOLIO.
14 1093 Here, madam, at your service.
14 1094 
14 1095 OLIVIA.
14 1096 Run after that same peevish messenger,
14 1097 The county's man: he left this ring behind him,
14 1098 Would I or not; tell him I'll none of it.
14 1099 Desire him not to flatter with his lord,
14 1100 Nor hold him up with hopes; I am not for him:
14 1101 If that the youth will come this way to-morrow,
14 1102 I'll give him reasons for't. Hie thee, Malvolio.
14 1103 
14 1104 MALVOLIO.
14 1105 Madam, I will.
14 1106 
14 1107 [Exit.]
14 1108 
14 1109 OLIVIA.
14 1110 I do I know not what: and fear to find
14 1111 Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind.
14 1112 Fate, show thy force. Ourselves we do not owe:
14 1113 What is decreed must be; and be this so!
14 1114 
14 1115 [Exit.]

14 1119 ACT II.
14 1120 
14 1121 SCENE I. The sea-coast.
14 1122 
14 1123 [Enter ANTONIO and SEBASTIAN.]
14 1124 
14 1125 ANTONIO.
14 1126 Will you stay no longer; nor will you not that I go with you?
14 1127 
14 1128 SEBASTIAN.
14 1129 By your patience, no; my stars shine darkly over me; the
14 1130 malignancy of my fate might, perhaps, distemper yours; therefore
14 1131 I shall crave of you your leave that I may bear my evils alone.
14 1132 It were a bad recompense for your love, to lay any of them on
14 1133 you.
14 1134 
14 1135 ANTONIO.
14 1136 Let me know of you whither you are bound.
14 1137 
14 1138 SEBASTIAN.
14 1139 No, 'sooth, sir; my determinate voyage is mere
14 1140 extravagancy. But I perceive in you so excellent a touch of
14 1141 modesty, that you will not extort from me what I am willing to
14 1142 keep in; therefore it charges me in manners the rather to express
14 1143 myself. You must know of me then, Antonio, my name is Sebastian,
14 1144 which I called Rodorigo; my father was that Sebastian of
14 1145 Messaline whom I know you have heard of: he left behind him
14 1146 myself and a sister, both born in an hour; if the heavens had
14 1147 been pleased, would we had so ended! but you, sir, altered that;
14 1148 for some hours before you took me from the breach of the sea was
14 1149 my sister drowned.
14 1150 
14 1151 ANTONIO.
14 1152 Alas the day!
14 1153 
14 1154 SEBASTIAN.
14 1155 A lady, sir, though it was said she much resembled me,
14 1156 was yet of many accounted beautiful: but though I could not, with
14 1157 such estimable wonder, overfar believe that, yet thus far I will
14 1158 boldly publish her,--she bore mind that envy could not but call
14 1159 fair. She is drowned already, sir, with salt water, though I seem
14 1160 to drown her remembrance again with more.
14 1161 
14 1162 ANTONIO.
14 1163 Pardon me, sir, your bad entertainment.
14 1164 
14 1165 SEBASTIAN.
14 1166 O, good Antonio, forgive me your trouble.
14 1167 
14 1168 ANTONIO.
14 1169 If you will not murder me for my love, let me be your servant.
14 1170 
14 1171 SEBASTIAN.
14 1172 If you will not undo what you have done--that is, kill
14 1173 him whom you have recovered--desire it not. Fare ye well at once;
14 1174 my bosom is full of kindness; and I am yet so near the manners of
14 1175 my mother that, upon the least occasion more, mine eyes will tell
14 1176 tales of me. I am bound to the Count Orsino's court: farewell.
14 1177 
14 1178 [Exit.]
14 1179 
14 1180 ANTONIO.
14 1181 The gentleness of all the gods go with thee!
14 1182 I have many cnemies in Orsino's court,
14 1183 Else would I very shortly see thee there:
14 1184 But come what may, I do adore thee so
14 1185 That danger shall seem sport, and I will go.
14 1186 
14 1187 [Exit.]
14 1188

14 1190 
14 1191 SCENE II. A street.
14 1192 
14 1193 [Enter VIOLA; MALVOLIO following.]
14 1194 
14 1195 MALVOLIO.
14 1196 Were you not even now with the Countess Olivia?
14 1197 
14 1198 VIOLA.
14 1199 Even now, sir; on a moderate pace I have since arrived but
14 1200 hither.
14 1201 
14 1202 MALVOLIO.
14 1203 She returns this ring to you, sir; you might have saved
14 1204 me my pains, to have taken it away yourself. She adds moreover,
14 1205 that you should put your lord into a desperate assurance she will
14 1206 none of him: and one thing more: that you be never so hardy to
14 1207 come again in his affairs, unless it be to report your lord's
14 1208 taking of this. Receive it so.
14 1209 
14 1210 VIOLA.
14 1211 She took the ring of me: I'll none of it.
14 1212 
14 1213 MALVOLIO.
14 1214 Come, sir, you peevishly threw it to her; and her will is
14 1215 it should be so returned. If it be worth stooping for, there it
14 1216 lies in your eye; if not, be it his that finds it.
14 1217 
14 1218 [Exit.]
14 1219 
14 1220 VIOLA.
14 1221 I left no ring with her; what means this lady?
14 1222 Fortune forbid my outside have not charm'd her!
14 1223 She made good view of me; indeed, so much,
14 1224 That methought her eyes had lost her tongue,
14 1225 For she did speak in starts distractedly.
14 1226 She loves me, sure: the cunning of her passion
14 1227 Invites me in this churlish messenger.
14 1228 None of my lord's ring! why, he sent her none.
14 1229 I am the man; --if it be so,--as 'tis,--
14 1230 Poor lady, she were better love a dream.
14 1231 Disguise, I see thou art a wickedness
14 1232 Wherein the pregnant enemy does much.
14 1233 How easy is it for the proper-false
14 1234 In women's waxen hearts to set their forms!
14 1235 Alas, our frailty is the cause, not we;
14 1236 For such as we are made of, such we be.
14 1237 How will this fadge? My master loves her dearly,
14 1238 And I, poor monster, fond as much on him;
14 1239 And she, mistaken, seems to dote on me.
14 1240 What will become of this? As I am man,
14 1241 My state is desperate for my master's love;
14 1242 As I am woman, now alas the day!
14 1243 What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe!
14 1244 O time, thou must untangle this, not I;
14 1245 It is too hard a knot for me to untie!
14 1246 
14 1247 [Exit.]
14 1248 
14 1249 SCENE III. A Room in OLIVIA'S House.
14 1250 
14 1251 [Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and SIR ANDREW AGUE-CHEEK.]
14 1252 
14 1253 SIR TOBY.
14 1254 Approach, Sir Andrew; not to be a-bed after midnight is to
14 1255 be up betimes; and diluculo surgere, thou know'st.
14 1256 
14 1257 SIR ANDREW.
14 1258 Nay; by my troth, I know not; but I know to be up late
14 1259 is to be up late.
14 1260 
14 1261 SIR TOBY.
14 1262 A false conclusion; I hate it as an unfilled can. To be
14 1263 up after midnight, and to go to bed then is early: so that to go
14 1264 to bed after midnight is to go to bed betimes. Do not our lives
14 1265 consist of the four elements?
14 1266 
14 1267 SIR ANDREW.
14 1268 Faith, so they say; but I think it rather consists of
14 1269 eating and drinking.
14 1270 
14 1271 SIR TOBY.
14 1272 Thou art a scholar; let us therefore eat and drink.--
14 1273 Marian, I say!--a stoup of wine.
14 1274 
14 1275 [Enter CLOWN.]
14 1276 
14 1277 SIR ANDREW.
14 1278 Here comes the fool, i' faith.
14 1279 
14 1280 CLOWN.
14 1281 How now, my hearts? Did you never see the picture of we three?
14 1282 
14 1283 SIR TOBY.
14 1284 Welcome, ass. Now let's have a catch.
14 1285 
14 1286 SIR ANDREW.
14 1287 By my troth, the fool has an excellent breast. I had
14 1288 rather than forty shillings I had such a leg; and so sweet a
14 1289 breath to sing, as the fool has. In sooth, thou wast in very
14 1290 gracious fooling last night when thou spokest of Pigrogromitus,
14 1291 of the Vapians passing the equinoctial of Queubus; 'twas very
14 1292 good, i' faith. I sent thee sixpence for thy leman. Hadst it?
14 1293 
14 1294 CLOWN.
14 1295 I did impeticos thy gratillity; for Malvolio's nose is no
14 1296 whipstock. My lady has a white hand, and the Myrmidons are no
14 1297 bottle-ale houses.
14 1298 
14 1299 SIR ANDREW.
14 1300 Excellent! Why, this is the best fooling, when all is
14 1301 done. Now, a song.
14 1302 
14 1303 SIR TOBY.
14 1304 Come on; there is sixpence for you: let's have a song.
14 1305 
14 1306 SIR ANDREW.
14 1307 There's a testril of me too: if one knight give a--
14 1308 
14 1309 CLOWN.
14 1310 Would you have a love-song, or a song of good life?
14 1311 
14 1312 SIR TOBY.
14 1313 A love-song, a love-song.
14 1314 
14 1315 SIR ANDREW.
14 1316 Ay, ay; I care not for good life.
14 1317 
14 1318 CLOWN.
14 1319         SONG
14 1320   O, mistress mine, where are you roaming?
14 1321   O, stay and hear; your true love's coming,
14 1322     That can sing both high and low:
14 1323   Trip no further, pretty sweeting;
14 1324     Journeys end in lovers meeting,
14 1325       Every wise man's son doth know.
14 1326 
14 1327 SIR ANDREW.
14 1328 Excellent good, i' faith.
14 1329 
14 1330 SIR TOBY.
14 1331 Good, good.
14 1332 
14 1333 CLOWN.
14 1334   What is love? 'tis not hereafter;
14 1335   Present mirth hath present laughter;
14 1336     What's to come is still unsure.
14 1337   In delay there lies no plenty;
14 1338   Then come kiss me, sweet and twenty;
14 1339     Youth's a stuff will not endure.
14 1340 
14 1341 SIR ANDREW.
14 1342 A mellifluous voice, as I am true knight.
14 1343 
14 1344 SIR TOBY.
14 1345 A contagious breath.
14 1346 
14 1347 SIR ANDREW.
14 1348 Very sweet and contagious, i' faith.
14 1349 
14 1350 SIR TOBY.
14 1351 To hear by the nose, it is dulcet in contagion. But shall
14 1352 we make the welkin dance indeed? Shall we rouse the night-owl in
14 1353 a catch that will draw three souls out of one weaver? shall we do
14 1354 that?
14 1355 
14 1356 SIR ANDREW.
14 1357 An you love me, let's do't: I am dog at a catch.
14 1358 
14 1359 CLOWN.
14 1360 By'r lady, sir, and some dogs will catch well.
14 1361 
14 1362 SIR ANDREW.
14 1363 Most certain: let our catch be, 'Thou knave.'
14 1364 
14 1365 CLOWN.
14 1366 'Hold thy peace, thou knave' knight? I shall be constrain'd
14 1367 in't to call thee knave, knight.
14 1368 
14 1369 SIR ANDREW.
14 1370 'Tis not the first time I have constrained one to call
14 1371 me knave. Begin, fool; it begins 'Hold thy peace.'
14 1372 
14 1373 CLOWN.
14 1374 I shall never begin if I hold my peace.
14 1375 
14 1376 SIR ANDREW.
14 1377 Good, i' faith! Come, begin.
14 1378 
14 1379 [They sing a catch.]
14 1380 
14 1381 [Enter MARIA.]
14 1382 
14 1383 MARIA.
14 1384 What a caterwauling do you keep here! If my lady have not
14 1385 called up her steward Malvolio, and bid him turn you out of
14 1386 doors, never trust me.
14 1387 
14 1388 SIR TOBY.
14 1389 My lady's a Cataian, we are politicians; Malvolio's a
14 1390 Peg-a-Ramsey, and
14 1391 [Singing.]
14 1392   'Three merry men be we.'
14 1393 Am not I consanguineous? am I not of her blood? Tilly-valley,
14 1394 lady.
14 1395   'There dwelt a man in Babylon, lady, lady.'
14 1396 
14 1397 CLOWN.
14 1398 Beshrew me, the knight's in admirable fooling.
14 1399 
14 1400 SIR ANDREW.
14 1401 Ay, he does well enough if he be disposed, and so do I
14 1402 too; he does it with a better grace, but I do it more natural.
14 1403 
14 1404 SIR TOBY.
14 1405 [Singing] O, the twelfth day of December,--
14 1406 
14 1407 MARIA.
14 1408 For the love o' God, peace!
14 1409 
14 1410 [Enter MALVOLIO]
14 1411 
14 1412 MALVOLIO.
14 1413 My masters, are you mad? or what are you? Have you no
14 1414 wit, manners, nor honesty, but to gabble like tinkers at this
14 1415 time of night? Do ye make an ale-house of my lady's house, that
14 1416 ye squeak out your coziers' catches without any mitigation or
14 1417 remorse of voice? Is there no respect of place, persons, nor
14 1418 time, in you?
14 1419 
14 1420 SIR TOBY.
14 1421 We did keep time, sir, in our catches. Sneck up!
14 1422 
14 1423 MALVOLIO.
14 1424 Sir Toby, I must be round with you. My lady bade me tell
14 1425 you that, though she harbours you as her kinsman she's nothing
14 1426 allied to your disorders. If you can separate yourself and your
14 1427 misdemeanours, you are welcome to the house; if not, an it would
14 1428 please you to take leave of her, she is very willing to bid you
14 1429 farewell.
14 1430 
14 1431 SIR TOBY.
14 1432 'Farewell, dear heart, since I must needs be gone.'
14 1433 
14 1434 MARIA.
14 1435 Nay, good Sir Toby.
14 1436 
14 1437 CLOWN.
14 1438 'His eyes do show his days are almost done.'
14 1439 
14 1440 MALVOLIO.
14 1441 Is't even so?
14 1442 
14 1443 SIR TOBY.
14 1444 'But I will never die.'
14 1445 
14 1446 CLOWN.
14 1447 Sir Toby, there you lie.
14 1448 
14 1449 MALVOLIO.
14 1450 This is much credit to you.
14 1451 
14 1452 SIR TOBY.
14 1453 [Singing] 'Shall I bid him go?'
14 1454 
14 1455 CLOWN.
14 1456 'What an if you do?'
14 1457 
14 1458 SIR TOBY.
14 1459 'Shall I bid him go, and spare not?'
14 1460 
14 1461 CLOWN.
14 1462 'O, no, no, no, no, you dare not.'
14 1463 
14 1464 SIR TOBY.
14 1465 Out o' tune? sir, ye lie. Art any more than a steward? Dost thou
14 1466 think, because thou art virtuous, there shall be no more cakes
14 1467 and ale?
14 1468 
14 1469 CLOWN.
14 1470 Yes, by Saint Anne; and ginger shall be hot i' the mouth
14 1471 too.
14 1472 
14 1473 SIR TOBY.
14 1474 Thou'art i' the right.--Go, sir, rub your chain with crumbs:
14 1475 A stoup of wine, Maria!
14 1476 
14 1477 MALVOLIO.
14 1478 Mistress Mary, if you prized my lady's favour at anything
14 1479 more than contempt, you would not give means for this uncivil
14 1480 rule; she shall know of it, by this hand.
14 1481 
14 1482 [Exit.]
14 1483 
14 1484 
14 1485 MARIA.
14 1486 Go shake your ears.
14 1487 
14 1488 SIR ANDREW.
14 1489 'Twere as good a deed as to drink when a man's a-hungry,
14 1490 to challenge him the field, and then to break promise with him
14 1491 and make a fool of him.
14 1492 
14 1493 SIR TOBY.
14 1494 Do't, knight; I'll write thee a challenge; or I'll
14 1495 deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth.
14 1496 
14 1497 MARIA.
14 1498 Sweet Sir Toby, be patient for to-night; since the youth of
14 1499 the count's was to-day with my lady, she is much out of quiet.
14 1500 For Monsieur Malvolio, let me alone with him: if I do not gull
14 1501 him into a nayword, and make him a common recreation, do not
14 1502 think I have wit enough to lie straight in my bed. I know I can
14 1503 do it.
14 1504 
14 1505 SIR TOBY.
14 1506 Possess us, possess us; tell us something of him.
14 1507 
14 1508 MARIA.
14 1509 Marry, sir, sometimes he is a kind of Puritan.
14 1510 
14 1511 SIR ANDREW.
14 1512 O, if I thought that, I'd beat him like a dog.
14 1513 
14 1514 SIR TOBY.
14 1515 What, for being a Puritan? thy exquisite reason, dear knight?
14 1516 
14 1517 SIR ANDREW.
14 1518 I have no exquisite reason for't, but I have reason good enough.
14 1519 
14 1520 MARIA.
14 1521 The devil a Puritan that he is, or anything constantly but a
14 1522 time-pleaser: an affectioned ass that cons state without book and
14 1523 utters it by great swarths; the best persuaded of himself, so
14 1524 crammed, as he thinks, with excellences, that it is his grounds
14 1525 of faith that all that look on him love him; and on that vice in
14 1526 him will my revenge find notable cause to work.
14 1527 
14 1528 SIR TOBY.
14 1529 What wilt thou do?
14 1530 
14 1531 MARIA.
14 1532 I will drop in his way some obscure epistles of love;
14 1533 wherein, by the colour of his beard, the shape of his leg, the
14 1534 manner of his gait, the expressure of his eye, forehead, and
14 1535 complexion, he shall find himself most feelingly personated. I
14 1536 can write very like my lady, your niece; on a forgotten matter we
14 1537 can hardly make distinction of our hands.
14 1538 
14 1539 SIR TOBY.
14 1540 Excellent! I smell a device.
14 1541 
14 1542 SIR ANDREW.
14 1543 I have't in my nose too.
14 1544 
14 1545 SIR TOBY.
14 1546 He shall think, by the letters that thou wilt drop, that
14 1547 they come from my niece, and that she is in love with him.
14 1548 
14 1549 MARIA.
14 1550 My purpose is, indeed, a horse of that colour.
14 1551 
14 1552 SIR ANDREW.
14 1553 And your horse now would make him an ass.
14 1554 
14 1555 MARIA.
14 1556 Ass, I doubt not.
14 1557 
14 1558 SIR ANDREW.
14 1559 O 'twill be admirable!
14 1560 
14 1561 MARIA.
14 1562 Sport royal, I warrant you. I know my physic will work with
14 1563 him. I will plant you two, and let the fool make a third, where
14 1564 he shall find the letter; observe his construction of it. For
14 1565 this night, to bed, and dream on the event. Farewell.
14 1566 
14 1567 [Exit.]
14 1568 
14 1569 SIR TOBY.
14 1570 Good night, Penthesilea.
14 1571 
14 1572 SIR ANDREW.
14 1573 Before me, she's a good wench.
14 1574 
14 1575 SIR TOBY.
14 1576 She's a beagle true bred, and one that adores me. What o' that?
14 1577 
14 1578 SIR ANDREW.
14 1579 I was adored once too.
14 1580 
14 1581 SIR TOBY.
14 1582 Let's to bed, knight.--Thou hadst need send for more money.
14 1583 
14 1584 SIR ANDREW.
14 1585 If I cannot recover your niece I am a foul way out.
14 1586 
14 1587 SIR TOBY.
14 1588 Send for money, knight; if thou hast her not i' the end,
14 1589 call me Cut.
14 1590 
14 1591 SIR ANDREW.
14 1592 If I do not, never trust me; take it how you will.
14 1593 
14 1594 SIR TOBY.
14 1595 Come, come; I'll go burn some sack; 'tis too late to go
14 1596 to bed now: come, knight; come, knight.
14 1597 
14 1598 [Exeunt.]

14 1602 SCENE IV. A Room in the DUKE'S Palace.
14 1603 
14 1604 [Enter DUKE, VIOLA, CURIO, and others.]
14 1605 
14 1606 DUKE.
14 1607 Give me some music:--Now, good morrow, friends:--
14 1608 Now, good Cesario, but that piece of song,
14 1609 That old and antique song we heard last night;
14 1610 Methought it did relieve my passion much;
14 1611 More than light airs and recollected terms
14 1612 Of these most brisk and giddy-paced times:--
14 1613 Come, but one verse.
14 1614 
14 1615 CURIO.
14 1616 He is not here, so please your lordship, that should sing it.
14 1617 
14 1618 DUKE.
14 1619 Who was it?
14 1620 
14 1621 CURIO.
14 1622 Feste, the jester, my lord; a fool that the Lady Olivia's
14 1623 father took much delight in: he is about the house.
14 1624 
14 1625 DUKE.
14 1626 Seek him out, and play the tune the while.
14 1627 
14 1628 [Exit CURIO.  Music.]
14 1629 
14 1630 Come hither, boy. If ever thou shalt love,
14 1631 In the sweet pangs of it remember me:
14 1632 For, such as I am, all true lovers are;
14 1633 Unstaid and skittish in all motions else,
14 1634 Save in the constant image of the creature
14 1635 That is belov'd.--How dost thou like this tune?
14 1636 
14 1637 VIOLA.
14 1638 It gives a very echo to the seat
14 1639 Where Love is throned.
14 1640 
14 1641 DUKE.
14 1642 Thou dost speak masterly:
14 1643 My life upon't, young though thou art, thine eye
14 1644 Hath stayed upon some favour that it loves;
14 1645 Hath it not, boy?
14 1646 
14 1647 VIOLA.
14 1648 A little, by your favour.
14 1649 
14 1650 DUKE.
14 1651 What kind of woman is't?
14 1652 
14 1653 VIOLA.
14 1654 Of your complexion.
14 1655 
14 1656 DUKE.
14 1657 She is not worth thee, then. What years, i' faith?
14 1658 
14 1659 VIOLA.
14 1660 About your years, my lord.
14 1661 
14 1662 DUKE.
14 1663 Too old, by heaven! Let still the woman take
14 1664 An elder than herself; so wears she to him,
14 1665 So sways she level in her husband's heart.
14 1666 For, boy, however we do praise ourselves,
14 1667 Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm,
14 1668 More longing, wavering, sooner lost and won,
14 1669 Than women's are.
14 1670 
14 1671 VIOLA.
14 1672 I think it well, my lord.
14 1673 
14 1674 DUKE.
14 1675 Then let thy love be younger than thyself,
14 1676 Or thy affection cannot hold the bent:
14 1677 For women are as roses, whose fair flower,
14 1678 Being once display'd, doth fall that very hour.
14 1679 
14 1680 VIOLA.
14 1681 And so they are: alas, that they are so;
14 1682 To die, even when they to perfection grow!
14 1683 
14 1684 [Re-enter CURIO and CLOWN.]
14 1685 
14 1686 DUKE.
14 1687 O, fellow, come, the song we had last night:--
14 1688 Mark it, Cesario; it is old and plain:
14 1689 The spinsters and the knitters in the sun,
14 1690 And the free maids, that weave their thread with bones,
14 1691 Do use to chant it: it is silly sooth,
14 1692 And dallies with the innocence of love
14 1693 Like the old age.
14 1694 
14 1695 CLOWN.
14 1696 Are you ready, sir?
14 1697 
14 1698 DUKE.
14 1699 Ay; pr'ythee, sing.  [Music]
14 1700 
14 1701 CLOWN.
14 1702       SONG
14 1703     Come away, come away, death.
14 1704   And in sad cypress let me be laid;
14 1705     Fly away, fly away, breath;
14 1706   I am slain by a fair cruel maid.
14 1707   My shroud of white, stuck all with yew,
14 1708        O, prepare it!
14 1709   My part of death no one so true
14 1710       Did share it.
14 1711 
14 1712    Not a flower, not a flower sweet,
14 1713  On my black coffin let there be strown:
14 1714    Not a friend, not a friend greet
14 1715  My poor corpse where my bones shall be thrown:
14 1716  A thousand thousand sighs to save,
14 1717        Lay me, O, where
14 1718  Sad true lover never find my grave,
14 1719        To weep there!
14 1720 
14 1721 DUKE.
14 1722 There's for thy pains.
14 1723 
14 1724 CLOWN.
14 1725 No pains, sir; I take pleasure in singing, sir.
14 1726 
14 1727 DUKE.
14 1728 I'll pay thy pleasure, then.
14 1729 
14 1730 CLOWN.
14 1731 Truly, sir, and pleasure will be paid one time or another.
14 1732 
14 1733 DUKE.
14 1734 Give me now leave to leave thee.
14 1735 
14 1736 CLOWN.
14 1737 Now the melancholy god protect thee; and the tailor make thy
14 1738 doublet of changeable taffeta, for thy mind is a very opal!--I
14 1739 would have men of such constancy put to sea, that their business
14 1740 might be everything, and their intent everywhere; for that's it
14 1741 that always makes a good voyage of nothing.--Farewell.
14 1742 
14 1743 [Exit CLOWN.]
14 1744 
14 1745 DUKE.
14 1746 Let all the rest give place.--
14 1747 
14 1748 [Exeunt CURIO and Attendants.]
14 1749 
14 1750 Once more, Cesario,
14 1751 Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty:
14 1752 Tell her my love, more noble than the world,
14 1753 Prizes not quantity of dirty lands;
14 1754 The parts that fortune hath bestow'd upon her,
14 1755 Tell her, I hold as giddily as fortune;
14 1756 But 'tis that miracle and queen of gems
14 1757 That Nature pranks her in attracts my soul.
14 1758 
14 1759 VIOLA.
14 1760 But if she cannot love you, sir?
14 1761 
14 1762 DUKE.
14 1763 I cannot be so answer'd.
14 1764 
14 1765 VIOLA.
14 1766 'Sooth, but you must.
14 1767 Say that some lady, as perhaps there is,
14 1768 Hath for your love as great a pang of heart
14 1769 As you have for Olivia: you cannot love her;
14 1770 You tell her so. Must she not then be answer'd?
14 1771 
14 1772 DUKE.
14 1773 There is no woman's sides
14 1774 Can bide the beating of so strong a passion
14 1775 As love doth give my heart: no woman's heart
14 1776 So big to hold so much; they lack retention.
14 1777 Alas, their love may be called appetite,--
14 1778 No motion of the liver, but the palate,--
14 1779 That suffer surfeit, cloyment, and revolt;
14 1780 But mine is all as hungry as the sea,
14 1781 And can digest as much: make no compare
14 1782 Between that love a woman can bear me
14 1783 And that I owe Olivia.
14 1784 
14 1785 VIOLA.
14 1786 Ay, but I know,--
14 1787 
14 1788 DUKE.
14 1789 What dost thou know?
14 1790 
14 1791 VIOLA.
14 1792 Too well what love women to men may owe.
14 1793 In faith, they are as true of heart as we.
14 1794 My father had a daughter loved a man,
14 1795 As it might be perhaps, were I a woman,
14 1796 I should your lordship.
14 1797 
14 1798 DUKE.
14 1799 And what's her history?
14 1800 
14 1801 VIOLA.
14 1802 A blank, my lord. She never told her love,
14 1803 But let concealment, like a worm i' the bud,
14 1804 Feed on her damask cheek: she pined in thought;
14 1805 And with a green and yellow melancholy,
14 1806 She sat like patience on a monument,
14 1807 Smiling at grief. Was not this love, indeed?
14 1808 We men may say more, swear more; but indeed,
14 1809 Our shows are more than will; for still we prove
14 1810 Much in our vows, but little in our love.
14 1811 
14 1812 DUKE.
14 1813 But died thy sister of her love, my boy?
14 1814 
14 1815 VIOLA.
14 1816 I am all the daughters of my father's house,
14 1817 And all the brothers too;--and yet I know not.--
14 1818 Sir, shall I to this lady?
14 1819 
14 1820 DUKE.
14 1821 Ay, that's the theme.
14 1822 To her in haste: give her this jewel; say
14 1823 My love can give no place, bide no denay.
14 1824 
14 1825 [Exeunt.]
14 1826 
14 1827 
14 1828 
14 1829 SCENE V. OLIVIA'S garden.
14 1830 
14 1831 [Enter SIR TOBY BELCH, SIR ANDREW AGUE-CHEEK, and FABIAN.]
14 1832 
14 1833 SIR TOBY.
14 1834 Come thy ways, Signior Fabian.
14 1835 
14 1836 FABIAN.
14 1837 Nay, I'll come; if I lose a scruple of this sport let me be
14 1838 boiled to death with melancholy.
14 1839 
14 1840 SIR TOBY.
14 1841 Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly rascally
14 1842 sheep-biter come by some notable shame?
14 1843 
14 1844 FABIAN.
14 1845 I would exult, man; you know he brought me out o' favour
14 1846 with my lady about a bear-baiting here.
14 1847 
14 1848 SIR TOBY.
14 1849 To anger him we'll have the bear again; and we will fool
14 1850 him black and blue:--shall we not, Sir Andrew?
14 1851 
14 1852 SIR ANDREW.
14 1853 An we do not, it is pity of our lives.
14 1854 
14 1855 [Enter MARIA.]
14 1856 
14 1857 SIR TOBY.
14 1858 Here comes the little villain:--How now, my nettle of India?
14 1859 
14 1860 MARIA.
14 1861 Get ye all three into the box-tree: Malvolio's coming down
14 1862 this walk; he has been yonder i' the sun practising behaviour to
14 1863 his own shadow this half hour: observe him, for the love of
14 1864 mockery; for I know this letter will make a contemplative idiot
14 1865 of him. Close, in the name of jesting! [The men hide themselves.]
14 1866 
14 1867 Lie thou there; [Throws down a letter] for here comes the trout
14 1868 that must be caught with tickling.
14 1869 
14 1870 [Exit Maria.]
14 1871 
14 1872 [Enter MALVOLIO.]
14 1873 
14 1874 MALVOLIO.
14 1875 'Tis but fortune; all is fortune. Maria once told me she
14 1876 did affect me: and I have heard herself come thus near, that,
14 1877 should she fancy, it should be one of my complexion. Besides, she
14 1878 uses me with a more exalted respect than any one else that
14 1879 follows her. What should I think on't?
14 1880 
14 1881 SIR TOBY.
14 1882 Here's an overweening rogue!
14 1883 
14 1884 FABIAN.
14 1885 O, peace! Contemplation makes a rare turkey-cock of him;
14 1886 how he jets under his advanced plumes!
14 1887 
14 1888 SIR ANDREW.
14 1889 'Slight, I could so beat the rogue:--
14 1890 
14 1891 SIR TOBY.
14 1892 Peace, I say.
14 1893 
14 1894 MALVOLIO.
14 1895 To be Count Malvolio;--
14 1896 
14 1897 SIR TOBY.
14 1898 Ah, rogue!
14 1899 
14 1900 SIR ANDREW.
14 1901 Pistol him, pistol him.
14 1902 
14 1903 SIR TOBY.
14 1904 Peace, peace.
14 1905 
14 1906 MALVOLIO.
14 1907 There is example for't; the lady of the Strachy married
14 1908 the yeoman of the wardrobe.
14 1909 
14 1910 SIR ANDREW.
14 1911 Fie on him, Jezebel!
14 1912 
14 1913 FABIAN.
14 1914 O, peace! now he's deeply in; look how imagination blows him.
14 1915 
14 1916 MALVOLIO.
14 1917 Having been three months married to her, sitting in my state,--
14 1918 
14 1919 SIR TOBY.
14 1920 O for a stone-bow to hit him in the eye!
14 1921 
14 1922 MALVOLIO.
14 1923 Calling my officers about me, in my branched velvet gown;
14 1924 having come from a day-bed, where I have left Olivia sleeping.
14 1925 
14 1926 SIR TOBY.
14 1927 Fire and brimstone!
14 1928 
14 1929 FABIAN.
14 1930 O, peace, peace.
14 1931 
14 1932 MALVOLIO.
14 1933 And then to have the humour of state: and after a demure
14 1934 travel of regard,--telling them I know my place as I would they
14 1935 should do theirs,--to ask for my kinsman Toby.
14 1936 
14 1937 SIR TOBY.
14 1938 Bolts and shackles!
14 1939 
14 1940 FABIAN.
14 1941 O, peace, peace, peace! Now, now.
14 1942 
14 1943 MALVOLIO.
14 1944 Seven of my people, with an obedient start, make out for
14 1945 him: I frown the while, and perchance, wind up my watch, or play
14 1946 with some rich jewel. Toby approaches; court'sies there to me:
14 1947 
14 1948 SIR TOBY.
14 1949 Shall this fellow live?
14 1950 
14 1951 FABIAN.
14 1952 Though our silence be drawn from us with cars, yet peace.
14 1953 
14 1954 MALVOLIO.
14 1955 I extend my hand to him thus, quenching my familiar smile with an
14 1956 austere regard of control:
14 1957 
14 1958 SIR TOBY.
14 1959 And does not Toby take you a blow o' the lips then?
14 1960 
14 1961 MALVOLIO.
14 1962 Saying 'Cousin Toby, my fortunes having cast me on your
14 1963 niece, give me this prerogative of speech':--
14 1964 
14 1965 SIR TOBY.
14 1966 What, what?
14 1967 
14 1968 MALVOLIO.
14 1969 'You must amend your drunkenness.'
14 1970 
14 1971 SIR TOBY.
14 1972 Out, scab!
14 1973 
14 1974 FABIAN.
14 1975 Nay, patience, or we break the sinews of our plot.
14 1976 
14 1977 MALVOLIO.
14 1978 'Besides, you waste the treasure of your time with a
14 1979 foolish knight';
14 1980 
14 1981 SIR ANDREW.
14 1982 That's me, I warrant you.
14 1983 
14 1984 MALVOLIO.
14 1985 'One Sir Andrew':
14 1986 
14 1987 SIR ANDREW.
14 1988 I knew 'twas I; for many do call me fool.
14 1989 
14 1990 MALVOLIO.
14 1991 What employment have we here?
14 1992 
14 1993 [Taking up the letter.]
14 1994 
14 1995 FABIAN.
14 1996 Now is the woodcock near the gin.
14 1997 
14 1998 SIR TOBY.
14 1999 O, peace! And the spirit of humours intimate reading aloud to
14 2000 him!
14 2001 
14 2002 MALVOLIO.
14 2003 By my life, this is my lady's hand: these be her very
14 2004 C's, her U's, and her T's; and thus makes she her great P's. It
14 2005 is in contempt of question, her hand.
14 2006 
14 2007 SIR ANDREW.
14 2008 Her C's, her U's, and her T's. Why that?
14 2009 
14 2010 MALVOLIO.
14 2011 [Reads] 'To the unknown beloved, this, and my good
14 2012 wishes.' Her very phrases!--By your leave, wax.--Soft!--and the
14 2013 impressure her Lucrece, with which she uses to seal: 'tis my
14 2014 lady. To whom should this be?
14 2015 
14 2016 FABIAN.
14 2017 This wins him, liver and all.
14 2018 
14 2019 MALVOLIO.
14 2020 [Reads]
14 2021   'Jove knows I love,
14 2022     But who?
14 2023   Lips, do not move,
14 2024   No man must know.'
14 2025 
14 2026 'No man must know.'--What follows? the numbers alter'd!--'No man
14 2027 must know':--If this should be thee, Malvolio?
14 2028 
14 2029 SIR TOBY.
14 2030 Marry, hang thee, brock!
14 2031 
14 2032 MALVOLIO.
14 2033   'I may command where I adore:
14 2034      But silence, like a Lucrece knife,
14 2035   With bloodless stroke my heart doth gore;
14 2036     M, O, A, I, doth sway my life.'
14 2037 
14 2038 FABIAN.
14 2039 A fustian riddle!
14 2040 
14 2041 SIR TOBY.
14 2042 Excellent wench, say I.
14 2043 
14 2044 MALVOLIO.
14 2045 'M, O, A, I, doth sway my life.'--Nay, but first let me see,--let
14 2046 me see,--let me see.
14 2047 
14 2048 FABIAN.
14 2049 What dish of poison has she dressed him!
14 2050 
14 2051 SIR TOBY.
14 2052 And with what wing the stannyel checks at it!
14 2053 
14 2054 MALVOLIO.
14 2055 'I may command where I adore.' Why, she may command me: I
14 2056 serve her, she is my lady. Why, this is evident to any formal
14 2057 capacity; there is no obstruction in this;--And the end,--What
14 2058 should that alphabetical position portend? If I could make that
14 2059 resemble something in me.--Softly!--M, O, A, I.--
14 2060 
14 2061 SIR TOBY.
14 2062 O, ay, make up that:--he is now at a cold scent.
14 2063 
14 2064 FABIAN.
14 2065 Sowter will cry upon't for all this, though it be as rank as a
14 2066 fox.
14 2067 
14 2068 MALVOLIO.
14 2069 M,--Malvolio; M,--why, that begins my name.
14 2070 
14 2071 FABIAN.
14 2072 Did not I say he would work it out?
14 2073 The cur is excellent at faults.
14 2074 
14 2075 MALVOLIO.
14 2076 M,--But then there is no consonancy in the sequel; that
14 2077 suffers under probation: A should follow, but O does.
14 2078 
14 2079 FABIAN.
14 2080 And O shall end, I hope.
14 2081 
14 2082 SIR TOBY.
14 2083 Ay, or I'll cudgel him, and make him cry 'O!'
14 2084 
14 2085 MALVOLIO.
14 2086 And then I comes behind.
14 2087 
14 2088 FABIAN.
14 2089 Ay, an you had any eye behind you, you might see more
14 2090 detraction at your heels than fortunes before you.
14 2091 
14 2092 MALVOLIO.
14 2093 M, O, A, I;--This simulation is not as the former:--and
14 2094 yet, to crush this a little, it would bow to me, for every one of
14 2095 these letters are in my name. Soft; here follows prose.--
14 2096 'If this fall into thy hand, revolve. In my stars I am above
14 2097 thee; but be not afraid of greatness. Some are born great, some
14 2098 achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them. Thy
14 2099 fates open their hands; let thy blood and spirit embrace them.
14 2100 And, to inure thyself to what thou art like to be, cast thy
14 2101 humble slough and appear fresh. Be opposite with a kinsman, surly
14 2102 with servants: let thy tongue tang arguments of state; put
14 2103 thyself into the trick of singularity: She thus advises thee that
14 2104 sighs for thee. Remember who commended thy yellow stockings, and
14 2105 wished to see thee ever cross-gartered. I say, remember. Go to;
14 2106 thou art made, if thou desirest to be so; if not, let me see thee
14 2107 a steward still, the fellow of servants, and not worthy to touch
14 2108 fortune's fingers. Farewell. She that would alter services with
14 2109 thee,
14 2110      'The fortunate-unhappy.'
14 2111 
14 2112 Daylight and champian discovers not more: this is open. I will be
14 2113 proud, I will read politic authors, I will baffle Sir Toby, I
14 2114 will wash off gross acquaintance, I will be point-device, the
14 2115 very man. I do not now fool myself to let imagination jade me;
14 2116 for every reason excites to this, that my lady loves me. She did
14 2117 commend my yellow stockings of late, she did praise my leg being
14 2118 cross-gartered; and in this she manifests herself to my love, and
14 2119 with a kind of injunction, drives me to these habits of her
14 2120 liking. I thank my stars I am happy. I will be strange, stout, in
14 2121 yellow stockings, and cross-gartered, even with the swiftness of
14 2122 putting on. Jove and my stars be praised!--Here is yet a
14 2123 postscript. 'Thou canst not choose but know who I am. If thou
14 2124 entertainest my love, let it appear in thy smiling; thy smiles
14 2125 become thee well: therefore in my presence still smile, dear my
14 2126 sweet, I pr'ythee.' Jove, I thank thee. I will smile; I will do
14 2127 everything that thou wilt have me.
14 2128 
14 2129 [Exit.]
14 2130 
14 2131 FABIAN.
14 2132 I will not give my part of this sport for a pension of
14 2133 thousands to be paid from the Sophy.
14 2134 
14 2135 SIR TOBY.
14 2136 I could marry this wench for this device:
14 2137 
14 2138 SIR ANDREW.
14 2139 So could I too.
14 2140 
14 2141 SIR TOBY.
14 2142 And ask no other dowry with her but such another jest.
14 2143 
14 2144 [Enter MARIA.]
14 2145 
14 2146 SIR ANDREW.
14 2147 Nor I neither.
14 2148 
14 2149 FABIAN.
14 2150 Here comes my noble gull-catcher.
14 2151 
14 2152 SIR TOBY.
14 2153 Wilt thou set thy foot o' my neck?
14 2154 
14 2155 SIR ANDREW.
14 2156 Or o' mine either?
14 2157 
14 2158 SIR TOBY.
14 2159 Shall I play my freedom at tray-trip, and become thy bond-slave?
14 2160 
14 2161 SIR ANDREW.
14 2162 I' faith, or I either?
14 2163 
14 2164 SIR TOBY.
14 2165 Why, thou hast put him in such a dream, that, when the
14 2166 image of it leaves him, he must run mad.
14 2167 
14 2168 MARIA.
14 2169 Nay, but say true; does it work upon him?
14 2170 
14 2171 SIR TOBY.
14 2172 Like aqua-vitae with a midwife.
14 2173 
14 2174 MARIA.
14 2175 If you will then see the fruits of the sport, mark his
14 2176 first approach before my lady: he will come to her in yellow
14 2177 stockings, and 'tis a colour she abhors, and cross-gartered, a
14 2178 fashion she detests; and he will smile upon her, which will now
14 2179 be so unsuitable to her disposition, being addicted to a
14 2180 melancholy as she is, that it cannot but turn him into a notable
14 2181 contempt; if you will see it, follow me.
14 2182 
14 2183 SIR TOBY.
14 2184 To the gates of Tartar, thou most excellent devil of wit!
14 2185 
14 2186 SIR ANDREW.
14 2187 I'll make one too.
14 2188 
14 2189 [Exeunt.]

14 2192 
14 2193 ACT III. SCENE I. OLIVIA'S garden.
14 2194 
14 2195 [Enter VIOLA, and CLOWN with a tabor.]
14 2196 
14 2197 VIOLA.
14 2198 Save thee, friend, and thy music. Dost thou live by thy tabor?
14 2199 
14 2200 CLOWN.
14 2201 No, sir, I live by the church.
14 2202 
14 2203 VIOLA.
14 2204 Art thou a churchman?
14 2205 
14 2206 CLOWN.
14 2207 No such matter, sir: I do live by the church; for I do live
14 2208 at my house, and my house doth stand by the church.
14 2209 
14 2210 VIOLA.
14 2211 So thou mayst say the king lies by a beggar, if a beggar
14 2212 dwell near him; or the church stands by thy tabor, if thy tabor
14 2213 stand by the church.
14 2214 
14 2215 CLOWN.
14 2216 You have said, sir.--To see this age!--A sentence is but a
14 2217 cheveril glove to a good wit. How quickly the wrong side may be
14 2218 turned outward!
14 2219 
14 2220 VIOLA.
14 2221 Nay, that's certain; they that dally nicely with words may
14 2222 quickly make them wanton.
14 2223 
14 2224 CLOWN.
14 2225 I would, therefore, my sister had had no name, sir.
14 2226 
14 2227 VIOLA.
14 2228 Why, man?
14 2229 
14 2230 CLOWN.
14 2231 Why, sir, her name's a word; and to dally with that word
14 2232 might make my sister wanton. But indeed words are very rascals,
14 2233 since bonds disgraced them.
14 2234 
14 2235 VIOLA.
14 2236 Thy reason, man?
14 2237 
14 2238 CLOWN.
14 2239 Troth, sir, I can yield you none without words; and words
14 2240 are grown so false I am loath to prove reason with them.
14 2241 
14 2242 VIOLA.
14 2243 I warrant, thou art a merry fellow, and carest for nothing.
14 2244 
14 2245 CLOWN.
14 2246 Not so, sir, I do care for something: but in my conscience,
14 2247 sir, I do not care for you; if that be to care for nothing, sir,
14 2248 I would it would make you invisible.
14 2249 
14 2250 VIOLA.
14 2251 Art not thou the Lady Olivia's fool?
14 2252 
14 2253 CLOWN.
14 2254 No, indeed, sir; the Lady Olivia has no folly: she will keep
14 2255 no fool, sir, till she be married; and fools are as like husbands
14 2256 as pilchards are to herrings, the husband's the bigger; I am,
14 2257 indeed, not her fool, but her corrupter of words.
14 2258 
14 2259 VIOLA.
14 2260 I saw thee late at the Count Orsino's.
14 2261 
14 2262 CLOWN.
14 2263 Foolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the sun; it
14 2264 shines everywhere. I would be sorry, sir, but the fool should be
14 2265 as oft with your master as with my mistress: I think I saw your
14 2266 wisdom there.
14 2267 
14 2268 VIOLA.
14 2269 Nay, an thou pass upon me, I'll no more with thee.
14 2270 Hold, there's expenses for thee.
14 2271 
14 2272 CLOWN.
14 2273 Now Jove, in his next commodity of hair, send thee a beard!
14 2274 
14 2275 VIOLA.
14 2276 By my troth, I'll tell thee, I am almost sick for one; though I
14 2277 would not have it grow on my chin. Is thy lady within?
14 2278 
14 2279 CLOWN.
14 2280 Would not a pair of these have bred, sir?
14 2281 
14 2282 VIOLA.
14 2283 Yes, being kept together and put to use.
14 2284 
14 2285 CLOWN.
14 2286 I would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia, sir, to bring a
14 2287 Cressida to this Troilus.
14 2288 
14 2289 VIOLA.
14 2290 I understand you, sir; 'tis well begged.
14 2291 
14 2292 CLOWN.
14 2293 The matter, I hope, is not great, sir, begging but a beggar:
14 2294 Cressida was a beggar. My lady is within, sir. I will construe to
14 2295 them whence you come; who you are and what you would are out of
14 2296 my welkin: I might say element; but the word is overworn.
14 2297 
14 2298 [Exit.]
14 2299 
14 2300 VIOLA.
14 2301 This fellow's wise enough to play the fool;
14 2302 And, to do that well, craves a kind of wit:
14 2303 He must observe their mood on whom he jests,
14 2304 The quality of persons, and the time;
14 2305 And, like the haggard, check at every feather
14 2306 That comes before his eye. This is a practice
14 2307 As full of labour as a wise man's art:
14 2308 For folly, that he wisely shows, is fit;
14 2309 But wise men, folly-fallen, quite taint their wit.
14 2310 
14 2311 [Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and SIR ANDREW AGUE-CHEEK.]
14 2312 
14 2313 SIR TOBY.
14 2314 Save you, gentleman.
14 2315 
14 2316 VIOLA.
14 2317 And you, sir.
14 2318 
14 2319 SIR ANDREW.
14 2320 Dieu vous garde, monsieur.
14 2321 
14 2322 VIOLA.
14 2323 Et vous aussi; votre serviteur.
14 2324 
14 2325 SIR ANDREW.
14 2326 I hope, sir, you are; and I am yours.
14 2327 
14 2328 SIR TOBY.
14 2329 Will you encounter the house? my niece is desirous you
14 2330 should enter, if your trade be to her.
14 2331 
14 2332 VIOLA.
14 2333 I am bound to your niece, sir: I mean, she is the list of my
14 2334 voyage.
14 2335 
14 2336 SIR TOBY.
14 2337 Taste your legs, sir; put them to motion.
14 2338 
14 2339 VIOLA.
14 2340 My legs do better understand me, sir, than I understand what
14 2341 you mean by bidding me taste my legs.
14 2342 
14 2343 SIR TOBY.
14 2344 I mean, to go, sir, to enter.
14 2345 
14 2346 VIOLA.
14 2347 I will answer you with gait and entrance: but we are prevented.
14 2348 
14 2349 [Enter OLIVIA and MARIA.]
14 2350 
14 2351 Most excellent accomplished lady, the heavens rain odours on you!
14 2352 
14 2353 SIR ANDREW.
14 2354 That youth's a rare courtier- 'Rain odours'! well.
14 2355 
14 2356 VIOLA.
14 2357 My matter hath no voice, lady, but to your own most pregnant
14 2358 and vouchsafed car.
14 2359 
14 2360 SIR ANDREW.
14 2361 'Odours,' 'pregnant,' and 'vouchsafed':--I'll get 'em all
14 2362 three ready.
14 2363 
14 2364 OLIVIA.
14 2365 Let the garden door be shut, and leave me to my hearing.
14 2366 
14 2367 [Exeunt SIR TOBY, SIR ANDREW, and MARIA.]
14 2368 
14 2369 Give me your hand, sir.
14 2370 
14 2371 VIOLA.
14 2372 My duty, madam, and most humble service.
14 2373 
14 2374 OLIVIA.
14 2375 What is your name?
14 2376 
14 2377 VIOLA.
14 2378 Cesario is your servant's name, fair princess.
14 2379 
14 2380 OLIVIA.
14 2381 My servant, sir! 'Twas never merry world,
14 2382 Since lowly feigning was call'd compliment:
14 2383 You are servant to the Count Orsino, youth.
14 2384 
14 2385 VIOLA.
14 2386 And he is yours, and his must needs be yours;
14 2387 Your servant's servant is your servant, madam.
14 2388 
14 2389 OLIVIA.
14 2390 For him, I think not on him: for his thoughts,
14 2391 Would they were blanks rather than fill'd with me!
14 2392 
14 2393 VIOLA.
14 2394 Madam, I come to whet your gentle thoughts
14 2395 On his behalf:--
14 2396 
14 2397 OLIVIA.
14 2398 O, by your leave, I pray you:
14 2399 I bade you never speak again of him:
14 2400 But, would you undertake another suit,
14 2401 I had rather hear you to solicit that
14 2402 Than music from the spheres.
14 2403 
14 2404 VIOLA.
14 2405 Dear lady,--
14 2406 
14 2407 OLIVIA.
14 2408 Give me leave, beseech you: I did send,
14 2409 After the last enchantment you did here,
14 2410 A ring in chase of you; so did I abuse
14 2411 Myself, my servant, and, I fear me, you:
14 2412 Under your hard construction must I sit;
14 2413 To force that on you, in a shameful cunning,
14 2414 Which you knew none of yours. What might you think?
14 2415 Have you not set mine honour at the stake,
14 2416 And baited it with all the unmuzzl'd thoughts
14 2417 That tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receiving
14 2418 Enough is shown: a cypress, not a bosom,
14 2419 Hides my heart: so let me hear you speak.
14 2420 
14 2421 VIOLA.
14 2422 I Pity you.
14 2423 
14 2424 OLIVIA.
14 2425 That's a degree to love.
14 2426 
14 2427 VIOLA.
14 2428 No, not a grise; for 'tis a vulgar proof
14 2429 That very oft we pity enemies.
14 2430 
14 2431 OLIVIA.
14 2432 Why, then, methinks 'tis time to smile again:
14 2433 O world, how apt the poor are to be proud!
14 2434 If one should be a prey, how much the better
14 2435 To fall before the lion than the wolf!  [Clock strikes.]
14 2436 The clock upbraids me with the waste of time.--
14 2437 Be not afraid, good youth, I will not have you:
14 2438 And yet, when wit and youth is come to harvest,
14 2439 Your wife is like to reap a proper man.
14 2440 There lies your way, due-west.
14 2441 
14 2442 VIOLA.
14 2443 Then westward-ho:
14 2444 Grace and good disposition 'tend your ladyship!
14 2445 You'll nothing, madam, to my lord by me?
14 2446 
14 2447 OLIVIA.
14 2448 Stay:
14 2449 I pr'ythee tell me what thou think'st of me.
14 2450 
14 2451 VIOLA.
14 2452 That you do think you are not what you are.
14 2453 
14 2454 OLIVIA.
14 2455 If I think so, I think the same of you.
14 2456 
14 2457 VIOLA.
14 2458 Then think you right; I am not what I am.
14 2459 
14 2460 OLIVIA.
14 2461 I would you were as I would have you be!
14 2462 
14 2463 VIOLA.
14 2464 Would it be better, madam, than I am,
14 2465 I wish it might; for now I am your fool.
14 2466 
14 2467 OLIVIA.
14 2468 O what a deal of scorn looks beautiful
14 2469 In the contempt and anger of his lip!
14 2470 A murd'rous guilt shows not itself more soon
14 2471 Than love that would seem hid: love's night is noon.
14 2472 Cesario, by the roses of the spring,
14 2473 By maidhood, honour, truth, and everything,
14 2474 I love thee so that, maugre all thy pride,
14 2475 Nor wit, nor reason, can my passion hide.
14 2476 Do not extort thy reasons from this clause,
14 2477 For, that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause:
14 2478 But rather reason thus with reason fetter:
14 2479 Love sought is good, but given unsought is better.
14 2480 
14 2481 VIOLA.
14 2482 By innocence I swear, and by my youth,
14 2483 I have one heart, one bosom, and one truth,
14 2484 And that no woman has; nor never none
14 2485 Shall mistress be of it, save I alone.
14 2486 And so adieu, good madam; never more
14 2487 Will I my master's tears to you deplore.
14 2488 
14 2489 OLIVIA.
14 2490 Yet come again: for thou, perhaps, mayst move
14 2491 That heart, which now abhors, to like his love.
14 2492 
14 2493 [Exeunt.]
14 2494 
14 2495 
14 2496 
14 2497 SCENE II. A Room in OLIVIA'S House.
14 2498 
14 2499 [Enter SIR TOBY BELCH, SIR ANDREW AGUE-CHEEK, and FABIAN.]
14 2500 
14 2501 SIR ANDREW.
14 2502 No, faith, I'll not stay a jot longer.
14 2503 
14 2504 SIR TOBY.
14 2505 Thy reason, dear venom: give thy reason.
14 2506 
14 2507 FABIAN.
14 2508 You must needs yield your reason, Sir Andrew.
14 2509 
14 2510 SIR ANDREW.
14 2511 Marry, I saw your niece do more favours to the count's
14 2512 servingman than ever she bestowed upon me; I saw't i' the
14 2513 orchard.
14 2514 
14 2515 SIR TOBY.
14 2516 Did she see thee the while, old boy? tell me that.
14 2517 
14 2518 SIR ANDREW.
14 2519 As plain as I see you now.
14 2520 
14 2521 FABIAN.
14 2522 This was a great argument of love in her toward you.
14 2523 
14 2524 SIR ANDREW.
14 2525 'Slight! will you make an ass o' me?
14 2526 
14 2527 FABIAN.
14 2528 I will prove it legitimate, sir, upon the oaths of judgment
14 2529 and reason.
14 2530 
14 2531 SIR TOBY.
14 2532 And they have been grand jurymen since before Noah was a
14 2533 sailor.
14 2534 
14 2535 FABIAN.
14 2536 She did show favour to the youth in your sight only to
14 2537 exasperate you, to awake your dormouse valour, to put fire in
14 2538 your heart and brimstone in your liver. You should then have
14 2539 accosted her; and with some excellent jests, fire-new from the
14 2540 mint, you should have banged the youth into dumbness. This was
14 2541 looked for at your hand, and this was baulked: the double gilt of
14 2542 this opportunity you let time wash off, and you are now sailed
14 2543 into the north of my lady's opinion; where you will hang like an
14 2544 icicle on Dutchman's beard, unless you do redeem it by some
14 2545 laudable attempt either of valour or policy.
14 2546 
14 2547 SIR ANDREW.
14 2548 And't be any way, it must be with valour: for policy I
14 2549 hate; I had as lief be a Brownist as a politician.
14 2550 
14 2551 SIR TOBY.
14 2552 Why, then, build me thy fortunes upon the basis of
14 2553 valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight with him; hurt
14 2554 him in eleven places; my niece shall take note of it: and assure
14 2555 thyself there is no love-broker in the world can more prevail in
14 2556 man's commendation with woman than report of valour.
14 2557 
14 2558 FABIAN.
14 2559 There is no way but this, Sir Andrew.
14 2560 
14 2561 SIR ANDREW.
14 2562 Will either of you bear me a challenge to him?
14 2563 
14 2564 SIR TOBY.
14 2565 Go, write it in a martial hand; be curst and brief; it is
14 2566 no matter how witty, so it be eloquent and full of invention;
14 2567 taunt him with the licence of ink; if thou 'thou'st' him some
14 2568 thrice, it shall not be amiss; and as many lies as will lie in
14 2569 thy sheet of paper, although the sheet were big enough for the
14 2570 bed of Ware in England, set 'em down; go about it. Let there be
14 2571 gall enough in thy ink; though thou write with a goose-pen, no
14 2572 matter. About it.
14 2573 
14 2574 SIR ANDREW.
14 2575 Where shall I find you?
14 2576 
14 2577 SIR TOBY.
14 2578 We'll call thee at the cubiculo. Go.
14 2579 
14 2580 [Exit SIR ANDREW.]
14 2581 
14 2582 FABIAN.
14 2583 This is a dear manakin to you, Sir Toby.
14 2584 
14 2585 SIR TOBY.
14 2586 I have been dear to him, lad; some two thousand strong, or so.
14 2587 
14 2588 FABIAN.
14 2589 We shall have a rare letter from him: but you'll not deliver it.
14 2590 
14 2591 SIR TOBY.
14 2592 Never trust me then; and by all means stir on the youth
14 2593 to an answer. I think oxen and wainropes cannot hale them
14 2594 together. For Andrew, if he were opened and you find so much
14 2595 blood in his liver as will clog the foot of a flea, I'll eat the
14 2596 rest of the anatomy.
14 2597 
14 2598 FABIAN.
14 2599 And his opposite, the youth, bears in his visage no great
14 2600 presage of cruelty.
14 2601 
14 2602 [Enter MARIA.]
14 2603 
14 2604 SIR TOBY.
14 2605 Look where the youngest wren of nine comes.
14 2606 
14 2607 MARIA.
14 2608 If you desire the spleen, and will laugh yourselves into
14 2609 stitches, follow me: yond gull Malvolio is turned heathen, a very
14 2610 renegado; for there is no Christian, that means to be saved by
14 2611 believing rightly, can ever believe such impossible passages of
14 2612 grossness. He's in yellow stockings.
14 2613 
14 2614 SIR TOBY.
14 2615 And cross-gartered?
14 2616 
14 2617 MARIA.
14 2618 Most villainously; like a pedant that keeps a school i' the
14 2619 church.--I have dogged him like his murderer. He does obey every
14 2620 point of the letter that I dropped to betray him. He does smile
14 2621 his face into more lines than is in the new map, with the
14 2622 augmentation of the Indies: you have not seen such a thing as
14 2623 'tis; I  can hardly forbear hurling things at him. I know my lady
14 2624 will strike him; if she do, he'll smile and take't for a great
14 2625 favour.
14 2626 
14 2627 SIR TOBY.
14 2628 Come, bring us, bring us where he is.
14 2629 
14 2630 [Exeunt.]
14 2631 
14 2632 
14 2633 
14 2634 SCENE III. A street.
14 2635 
14 2636 [Enter ANTONIO and SEBASTIAN.]
14 2637 
14 2638 SEBASTIAN.
14 2639 I would not by my will have troubled you;
14 2640 But since you make your pleasure of your pains,
14 2641 I will no further chide you.
14 2642 
14 2643 ANTONIO.
14 2644 I could not stay behind you: my desire,
14 2645 More sharp than filed steel, did spur me forth;
14 2646 And not all love to see you,--though so much,
14 2647 As might have drawn one to a longer voyage,--
14 2648 But jealousy what might befall your travel,
14 2649 Being skilless in these parts; which to a stranger,
14 2650 Unguided and unfriended, often prove
14 2651 Rough and unhospitable. My willing love,
14 2652 The rather by these arguments of fear,
14 2653 Set forth in your pursuit.
14 2654 
14 2655 SEBASTIAN.
14 2656 My kind Antonio,
14 2657 I can no other answer make but thanks,
14 2658 And thanks, and ever thanks. Often good turns
14 2659 Are shuffled off with such uncurrent pay;
14 2660 But were my worth, as is my conscience, firm,
14 2661 You should find better dealing. What's to do?
14 2662 Shall we go see the reliques of this town?
14 2663 
14 2664 ANTONIO.
14 2665 To-morrow, sir; best, first, go see your lodging.
14 2666 
14 2667 SEBASTIAN.
14 2668 I am not weary, and 'tis long to night;
14 2669 I pray you, let us satisfy our eyes
14 2670 With the memorials and the things of fame
14 2671 That do renown this city.
14 2672 
14 2673 ANTONIO.
14 2674 Would you'd pardon me;
14 2675 I do not without danger walk these streets:
14 2676 Once in a sea-fight, 'gainst the count, his galleys,
14 2677 I did some service; of such note, indeed,
14 2678 That, were I ta'en here, it would scarce be answered.
14 2679 
14 2680 SEBASTIAN.
14 2681 Belike you slew great number of his people.
14 2682 
14 2683 ANTONIO.
14 2684 The offence is not of such a bloody nature;
14 2685 Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel
14 2686 Might well have given us bloody argument.
14 2687 It might have since been answered in repaying
14 2688 What we took from them; which, for traffic's sake,
14 2689 Most of our city did: only myself stood out;
14 2690 For which, if I be lapsed in this place,
14 2691 I shall pay dear.
14 2692 
14 2693 SEBASTIAN.
14 2694 Do not then walk too open.
14 2695 
14 2696 ANTONIO.
14 2697 It doth not fit me. Hold, sir, here's my purse;
14 2698 In the south suburbs, at the Elephant,
14 2699 Is best to lodge: I will bespeak our diet
14 2700 Whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge
14 2701 With viewing of the town; there shall you have me.
14 2702 
14 2703 SEBASTIAN.
14 2704 Why I your purse?
14 2705 
14 2706 ANTONIO.
14 2707 Haply your eye shall light upon some toy
14 2708 You have desire to purchase; and your store,
14 2709 I think, is not for idle markets, sir.
14 2710 
14 2711 SEBASTIAN.
14 2712 I'll be your purse-bearer, and leave you for an hour.
14 2713 
14 2714 ANTONIO.
14 2715 To the Elephant.--
14 2716 
14 2717 SEBASTIAN.
14 2718 I do remember.
14 2719 
14 2720 [Exeunt.]
14 2721 
14 2722 
14 2723 
14 2724 SCENE IV. OLIVIA'S garden.
14 2725 
14 2726 [Enter OLIVIA and MARIA.]
14 2727 
14 2728 OLIVIA.
14 2729 I have sent after him. He says he'll come;
14 2730 How shall I feast him? what bestow on him?
14 2731 For youth is bought more oft than begged or borrowed.
14 2732 I speak too loud.--
14 2733 Where's Malvolio?--He is sad and civil,
14 2734 And suits well for a servant with my fortunes;--
14 2735 Where is Malvolio?
14 2736 
14 2737 MARIA.
14 2738 He's coming, madam:
14 2739 But in very strange manner. He is sure possessed.
14 2740 
14 2741 OLIVIA.
14 2742 Why, what's the matter? does he rave?
14 2743 
14 2744 MARIA.
14 2745 No, madam, he does nothing but smile: your ladyship were
14 2746 best to have some guard about you if he come;
14 2747 For, sure, the man is tainted in his wits.
14 2748 
14 2749 OLIVIA.
14 2750 Go call him hither.--I'm as mad as he,
14 2751 If sad and merry madness equal be.--
14 2752 
14 2753 [Enter MALVOLIO.]
14 2754 
14 2755 How now, Malvolio?
14 2756 
14 2757 MALVOLIO.
14 2758 Sweet lady, ho, ho.
14 2759 
14 2760 [Smiles fantastically.]
14 2761 
14 2762 OLIVIA.
14 2763 Smil'st thou?
14 2764 I sent for thee upon a sad occasion.
14 2765 
14 2766 MALVOLIO.
14 2767 Sad, lady? I could be sad: this does make some
14 2768 obstruction in the blood, this cross-gartering. But what of that?
14 2769 If it please the eye of one, it is with me as the very true
14 2770 sonnet is: 'Please one and please all.'
14 2771 
14 2772 OLIVIA.
14 2773 Why, how dost thou, man? what is the matter with thee?
14 2774 
14 2775 MALVOLIO.
14 2776 Not black in my mind, though yellow in my legs.
14 2777 It did come to his hands, and commands shall be executed.
14 2778 I think we do know the sweet Roman hand.
14 2779 
14 2780 OLIVIA.
14 2781 Wilt thou go to bed, Malvolio?
14 2782 
14 2783 MALVOLIO.
14 2784 To bed? ay, sweetheart; and I'll come to thee.
14 2785 
14 2786 OLIVIA.
14 2787 God comfort thee! Why dost thou smile so, and kiss thy hand so
14 2788 oft?
14 2789 
14 2790 MARIA.
14 2791 How do you, Malvolio?
14 2792 
14 2793 MALVOLIO.
14 2794 At your request? Yes; nightingales answer daws.
14 2795 
14 2796 MARIA.
14 2797 Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady?
14 2798 
14 2799 MALVOLIO.
14 2800 'Be not afraid of greatness':--'twas well writ.
14 2801 
14 2802 OLIVIA.
14 2803 What meanest thou by that, Malvolio?
14 2804 
14 2805 MALVOLIO.
14 2806 'Some are born great,'--
14 2807 
14 2808 OLIVIA.
14 2809 Ha?
14 2810 
14 2811 MALVOLIO.
14 2812 'Some achieve greatness,'--
14 2813 
14 2814 OLIVIA.
14 2815 What say'st thou?
14 2816 
14 2817 MALVOLIO.
14 2818 'And some have greatness thrust upon them.'
14 2819 
14 2820 OLIVIA.
14 2821 Heaven restore thee!
14 2822 
14 2823 MALVOLIO.
14 2824 'Remember who commended thy yellow stockings;'--
14 2825 
14 2826 OLIVIA.
14 2827 Thy yellow stockings?
14 2828 
14 2829 MALVOLIO.
14 2830 'And wished to see thee cross-gartered.'
14 2831 
14 2832 OLIVIA.
14 2833 Cross-gartered?
14 2834 
14 2835 MALVOLIO.
14 2836 'Go to: thou an made, if thou desirest to be so:'--
14 2837 
14 2838 OLIVIA.
14 2839 Am I made?
14 2840 
14 2841 MALVOLIO.
14 2842 'If not, let me see thee a servant still.'
14 2843 
14 2844 OLIVIA.
14 2845 Why, this is very midsummer madness.
14 2846 
14 2847 [Enter Servant.]
14 2848 
14 2849 SERVANT.
14 2850 Madam, the young gentleman of the Count Orsino's is
14 2851 returned; I could hardly entreat him back; he attends your
14 2852 ladyship's pleasure.
14 2853 
14 2854 OLIVIA.
14 2855 I'll come to him.
14 2856 
14 2857 [Exit Servant.]
14 2858 
14 2859 Good Maria, let this fellow be looked to. Where's my cousin Toby?
14 2860 Let some of my people have a special care of him; I would not
14 2861 have him miscarry for the half of my dowry.
14 2862 
14 2863 [Exeunt OLIVIA and MARIA.]
14 2864 
14 2865 MALVOLIO.
14 2866 O, ho! do you come near me now? No worse man than Sir
14 2867 Toby to look to me? This concurs directly with the letter: she
14 2868 sends him on purpose, that I may appear stubborn to him; for she
14 2869 incites me to that in the letter. 'Cast thy humble slough,' says
14 2870 she;--'be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants,--let thy
14 2871 tongue tang with arguments of state,--put thyself into the trick
14 2872 of singularity;--and consequently, sets down the manner how; as,
14 2873 a sad face, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in the habit of
14 2874 some sir of note, and so forth. I have limed her; but it is
14 2875 Jove's doing, and Jove make me thankful! And, when she went away
14 2876 now, 'Let this fellow be looked to;' Fellow! not Malvolio, nor
14 2877 after my degree, but fellow. Why, everything adheres together;
14 2878 that no dram of a scruple, no scruple of a scruple, no obstacle,
14 2879 no incredulous or unsafe circumstance,--What can be said?
14 2880 Nothing, that can be, can come between me and the full prospect
14 2881 of my hopes. Well, Jove, not I, is the doer of this, and he is to
14 2882 be thanked.
14 2883 
14 2884 [Re-enter MARIA, with SIR TOBY BELCH and FABIAN.]
14 2885 
14 2886 SIR TOBY.
14 2887 Which way is he, in the name of sanctity? If all the
14 2888 devils of hell be drawn in little, and Legion himself possessed
14 2889 him, yet I'll speak to him.
14 2890 
14 2891 FABIAN.
14 2892 Here he is, here he is:--How is't with you, sir? how is't with
14 2893 you, man?
14 2894 
14 2895 MALVOLIO.
14 2896 Go off; I discard you; let me enjoy my private; go off.
14 2897 
14 2898 MARIA.
14 2899 Lo, how hollow the fiend speaks within him! did not I tell
14 2900 you?--Sir Toby, my lady prays you to have a care of him.
14 2901 
14 2902 MALVOLIO.
14 2903 Ah, ha! does she so?
14 2904 
14 2905 SIR TOBY.
14 2906 Go to, go to; peace, peace, we must deal gently with him;
14 2907 let me alone. How do you, Malvolio? how is't with you? What, man!
14 2908 defy the devil: consider, he's an enemy to mankind.
14 2909 
14 2910 MALVOLIO.
14 2911 Do you know what you say?
14 2912 
14 2913 MARIA.
14 2914 La you, an you speak ill of the devil, how he takes it at
14 2915 heart! Pray God he be not bewitched.
14 2916 
14 2917 FABIAN.
14 2918 Carry his water to the wise woman.
14 2919 
14 2920 MARIA.
14 2921 Marry, and it shall be done to-morrow morning, if I live. My
14 2922 lady would not lose him for more than I'll say.
14 2923 
14 2924 MALVOLIO.
14 2925 How now, mistress!
14 2926 
14 2927 MARIA.
14 2928 O lord!
14 2929 
14 2930 SIR TOBY.
14 2931 Pr'ythee hold thy peace; this is not the way. Do you not
14 2932 see you move him? let me alone with him.
14 2933 
14 2934 FABIAN.
14 2935 No way but gentleness; gently, gently: the fiend is rough,
14 2936 and will not be roughly used.
14 2937 
14 2938 SIR TOBY.
14 2939 Why, how now, my bawcock? how dost thou, chuck.
14 2940 
14 2941 MALVOLIO.
14 2942 Sir?
14 2943 
14 2944 SIR TOBY.
14 2945 Ay, Biddy, come with me. What, man! 'tis not for gravity
14 2946 to play at cherry-pit with Satan. Hang him, foul collier!
14 2947 
14 2948 MARIA.
14 2949 Get him to say his prayers; good Sir Toby, get him to pray.
14 2950 
14 2951 MALVOLIO.
14 2952 My prayers, minx?
14 2953 
14 2954 MARIA.
14 2955 No, I warrant you, he will not hear of godliness.
14 2956 
14 2957 MALVOLIO.
14 2958 Go, hang yourselves all! you are idle shallow things: I
14 2959 am not of your element; you shall know more hereafter.
14 2960 
14 2961 [Exit.]
14 2962 
14 2963 SIR TOBY.
14 2964 Is't possible?
14 2965 
14 2966 FABIAN.
14 2967 If this were played upon a stage now, I could condemn it as
14 2968 an improbable fiction.
14 2969 
14 2970 SIR TOBY.
14 2971 His very genius hath taken the infection of the device, man.
14 2972 
14 2973 MARIA.
14 2974 Nay, pursue him now; lest the device take air and taint.
14 2975 
14 2976 FABIAN.
14 2977 Why, we shall make him mad indeed.
14 2978 
14 2979 MARIA.
14 2980 The house will be the quieter.
14 2981 
14 2982 SIR TOBY.
14 2983 Come, we'll have him in a dark room and bound. My niece
14 2984 is already in the belief that he's mad; we may carry it thus, for
14 2985 our pleasure and his penance, till our very pastime, tired out of
14 2986 breath, prompt us to have mercy on him: at which time we will
14 2987 bring the device to the bar, and crown thee for a finder of
14 2988 madmen. But see, but see.
14 2989 
14 2990 [Enter SIR ANDREW AGUE-CHEEK.]
14 2991 
14 2992 FABIAN.
14 2993 More matter for a May morning.
14 2994 
14 2995 SIR ANDREW.
14 2996 Here's the challenge, read it; I warrant there's vinegar and
14 2997 pepper in't.
14 2998 
14 2999 FABIAN.
14 3000 Is't so saucy?
14 3001 
14 3002 SIR ANDREW.
14 3003 Ay, is't, I warrant him; do but read.
14 3004 
14 3005 SIR TOBY.
14 3006 Give me. [Reads.] 'Youth, whatsoever thou art, thou art but a
14 3007 scurvy fellow.'
14 3008 
14 3009 FABIAN.
14 3010 Good and valiant.
14 3011 
14 3012 SIR TOBY.
14 3013 'Wonder not, nor admire not in thy mind, why I do
14 3014 call thee so, for I will show thee no reason for't.'
14 3015 
14 3016 FABIAN.
14 3017 A good note: that keeps you from the blow of the law.
14 3018 
14 3019 SIR TOBY.
14 3020 'Thou comest to the Lady Olivia, and in my sight
14 3021 she uses thee kindly: but thou liest in thy throat; that is not
14 3022 the matter I challenge thee for.'
14 3023 
14 3024 FABIAN.
14 3025 Very brief, and to exceeding good senseless.
14 3026 
14 3027 SIR TOBY.
14 3028 'I will waylay thee going home; where if it be
14 3029 thy chance to kill me,'--
14 3030 
14 3031 FABIAN.
14 3032 Good.
14 3033 
14 3034 SIR TOBY.
14 3035 'Thou kill'st me like a rogue and a villain.'
14 3036 
14 3037 FABIAN.
14 3038 Still you keep o' the windy side of the law. Good.
14 3039 
14 3040 SIR TOBY.
14 3041 'Fare thee well; and God have mercy upon one of
14 3042 our souls! He may have mercy upon mine; but my hope is better,
14 3043 and so look to thyself. Thy friend, as thou usest him, and thy
14 3044 sworn enemy, Andrew Ague-Cheek.'
14 3045 If this letter move him not, his legs cannot: I'll give't him.
14 3046 
14 3047 MARIA.
14 3048 You may have very fit occasion for't; he is now in some
14 3049 commerce with my lady, and will by and by depart.
14 3050 
14 3051 SIR TOBY.
14 3052 Go, Sir Andrew; scout me for him at the corner of the
14 3053 orchard, like a bum-bailiff; so soon as ever thou seest him,
14 3054 draw; and as thou drawest, swear horrible; for it comes to pass
14 3055 oft that a terrible oath, with a swaggering accent sharply
14 3056 twanged off, gives manhood more approbation than ever proof
14 3057 itself would have earned him. Away.
14 3058 
14 3059 SIR ANDREW.
14 3060 Nay, let me alone for swearing.
14 3061 
14 3062 [Exit.]
14 3063 
14 3064 SIR TOBY.
14 3065 Now will not I deliver his letter; for the behaviour of
14 3066 the young gentleman gives him out to be of good capacity and
14 3067 breeding; his employment between his lord and my niece confirms
14 3068 no less; therefore this letter, being so excellently ignorant,
14 3069 will breed no terror in the youth: he will find it comes from a
14 3070 clodpole. But, sir, I will deliver his challenge by word of
14 3071 mouth, set upon Ague-cheek notable report of valour, and drive
14 3072 the gentleman,--as I know his youth will aptly receive it,--into
14 3073 a most hideous opinion of his rage, skill, fury, and impetuosity.
14 3074 This will so fright them both that they will kill one another by
14 3075 the look, like cockatrices.
14 3076 
14 3077 [Enter OLIVIA and VIOLA.]
14 3078 
14 3079 FABIAN.
14 3080 Here he comes with your niece; give them way till he take
14 3081 leave, and presently after him.
14 3082 
14 3083 SIR TOBY.
14 3084 I will meditate the while upon some horrid message for a
14 3085 challenge.
14 3086 
14 3087 [Exeunt SIR TOBY, FABIAN, and MARIA.]
14 3088 
14 3089 OLIVIA.
14 3090 I have said too much unto a heart of stone,
14 3091 And laid mine honour too unchary on it:
14 3092 There's something in me that reproves my fault;
14 3093 But such a headstrong potent fault it is
14 3094 That it but mocks reproof.
14 3095 
14 3096 VIOLA.
14 3097 With the same 'haviour that your passion bears
14 3098 Goes on my master's griefs.
14 3099 
14 3100 OLIVIA.
14 3101 Here, wear this jewel for me; 'tis my picture;
14 3102 Refuse it not; it hath no tongue to vex you:
14 3103 And, I beseech you, come again to-morrow.
14 3104 What shall you ask of me that I'll deny,
14 3105 That, honour saved, may upon asking give?
14 3106 
14 3107 VIOLA.
14 3108 Nothing but this, your true love for my master.
14 3109 
14 3110 OLIVIA.
14 3111 How with mine honour may I give him that
14 3112 Which I have given to you?
14 3113 
14 3114 VIOLA.
14 3115 I will acquit you.
14 3116 
14 3117 OLIVIA.
14 3118 Well, come again to-morrow. Fare thee well;
14 3119 A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell.
14 3120 
14 3121 [Exit.]
14 3122 
14 3123 [Re-enter SIR TOBY BELCH and SIR FABIAN.]
14 3124 
14 3125 SIR TOBY.
14 3126 Gentleman, God save thee.
14 3127 
14 3128 VIOLA.
14 3129 And you, sir.
14 3130 
14 3131 SIR TOBY.
14 3132 That defence thou hast, betake thee to't. Of what nature
14 3133 the wrongs are thou hast done him, I know not; but thy
14 3134 intercepter, full of despite, bloody as the hunter, attends
14 3135 thee at the orchard end: dismount thy tuck, be yare in thy
14 3136 preparation, for thy assailant is quick, skilful, and deadly.
14 3137 
14 3138 VIOLA.
14 3139 You mistake, sir; I am sure no man hath any quarrel to me;
14 3140 my remembrance is very free and clear from any image of offence
14 3141 done to any man.
14 3142 
14 3143 SIR TOBY.
14 3144 You'll find it otherwise, I assure you: therefore, if you
14 3145 hold your life at any price, betake you to your guard; for your
14 3146 opposite hath in him what youth, strength, skill, and wrath, can
14 3147 furnish man withal.
14 3148 
14 3149 VIOLA.
14 3150 I pray you, sir, what is he?
14 3151 
14 3152 SIR TOBY.
14 3153 He is knight, dubbed with unhacked rapier and on carpet
14 3154 consideration; but he is a devil in private brawl; souls and
14 3155 bodies hath he divorced three; and his incensement at this moment
14 3156 is so implacable that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of
14 3157 death and sepulchre: hob, nob is his word; give't or take't.
14 3158 
14 3159 VIOLA.
14 3160 I will return again into the house and desire some conduct
14 3161 of the lady. I am no fighter. I have heard of some kind of men
14 3162 that put quarrels purposely on others to taste their valour:
14 3163 belike this is a man of that quirk.
14 3164 
14 3165 SIR TOBY.
14 3166 Sir, no; his indignation derives itself out of a very
14 3167 competent injury; therefore, get you on and give him his desire.
14 3168 Back you shall not to the house, unless you undertake that with
14 3169 me which with as much safety you might answer him: therefore on,
14 3170 or strip your sword stark naked; for meddle you must, that's
14 3171 certain, or forswear to wear iron about you.
14 3172 
14 3173 VIOLA.
14 3174 This is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you, do me this
14 3175 courteous office as to know of the knight what my offence to him
14 3176 is; it is something of my negligence, nothing of my purpose.
14 3177 
14 3178 SIR TOBY.
14 3179 I Will do so. Signior Fabian, stay you by this gentleman
14 3180 till my return.
14 3181 
14 3182 [Exit SIR TOBY.]
14 3183 
14 3184 VIOLA.
14 3185 Pray you, sir, do you know of this matter?
14 3186 
14 3187 FABIAN.
14 3188 I know the knight is incensed against you, even to a mortal
14 3189 arbitrement; but nothing of the circumstance more.
14 3190 
14 3191 VIOLA.
14 3192 I beseech you, what manner of man is he?
14 3193 
14 3194 FABIAN.
14 3195 Nothing of that wonderful promise, to read him by his form,
14 3196 as you are like to find him in the proof of his valour. He is
14 3197 indeed, sir, the most skilful, bloody, and fatal opposite that
14 3198 you could possibly have found in any part of Illyria. Will you
14 3199 walk towards him? I will make your peace with him if I can.
14 3200 
14 3201 VIOLA.
14 3202 I shall be much bound to you for't. I am one that would
14 3203 rather go with sir priest than sir knight: I care not who knows
14 3204 so much of my mettle.
14 3205 
14 3206 [Exeunt.]
14 3207 
14 3208 [Re-enter SIR TOBY With SIR ANDREW.]
14 3209 
14 3210 SIR TOBY.
14 3211 Why, man, he's a very devil; I have not seen such a
14 3212 virago. I had a pass with him, rapier, scabbard, and all, and he
14 3213 gives me the stuck-in with such a mortal motion that it is
14 3214 inevitable; and on the answer, he pays you as surely as your feet
14 3215 hit the ground they step on. They say he has been fencer to the
14 3216 Sophy.
14 3217 
14 3218 SIR ANDREW.
14 3219 Pox on't, I'll not meddle with him.
14 3220 
14 3221 SIR TOBY.
14 3222 Ay, but he will not now be pacified: Fabian can scarce
14 3223 hold him yonder.
14 3224 
14 3225 SIR ANDREW.
14 3226 Plague on't; an I thought he had been valiant, and so
14 3227 cunning in fence, I'd have seen him damned ere I'd have
14 3228 challenged him. Let him let the matter slip and I'll give him
14 3229 my horse, grey Capilet.
14 3230 
14 3231 SIR TOBY.
14 3232 I'll make the motion. Stand here, make a good show on't;
14 3233 this shall end without the perdition of souls. [Aside.] Marry,
14 3234 I'll ride your horse as well as I ride you.
14 3235 
14 3236 [Re-enter FABIAN and VIOLA.]
14 3237 
14 3238 I have his horse [To FABIAN.] to take up the quarrel; I have
14 3239 persuaded him the youth's a devil.
14 3240 
14 3241 FABIAN.
14 3242 He is as horribly conceited of him; and pants and looks pale, as
14 3243 if a bear were at his heels.
14 3244 
14 3245 SIR TOBY.
14 3246 There's no remedy, sir: he will fight with you for's oath sake:
14 3247 marry, he hath better bethought him of his quarrel, and he finds
14 3248 that now scarce to be worth talking of: therefore, draw for the
14 3249 supportance of his vow; he protests he will not hurt you.
14 3250 
14 3251 VIOLA.
14 3252 [Aside] Pray God defend me! A little thing would make me
14 3253 tell them how much I lack of a man.
14 3254 
14 3255 FABIAN.
14 3256 Give ground if you see him furious.
14 3257 
14 3258 SIR TOBY.
14 3259 Come, Sir Andrew, there's no remedy; the gentleman will,
14 3260 for his honour's sake, have one bout with you: he cannot by the
14 3261 duello avoid it; but he has promised me, as he is a gentleman and
14 3262 a soldier, he will not hurt you. Come on: to't.
14 3263 
14 3264 SIR ANDREW.
14 3265 Pray God he keep his oath!
14 3266 
14 3267 [Draws.]
14 3268 
14 3269 [Enter ANTONIO.]
14 3270 
14 3271 VIOLA.
14 3272 I do assure you 'tis against my will.
14 3273 
14 3274 [Draws.]
14 3275 
14 3276 ANTONIO.
14 3277 Put up your sword:--if this young gentleman
14 3278 Have done offence, I take the fault on me;
14 3279 If you offend him, I for him defy you.
14 3280 
14 3281 [Drawing.]
14 3282 
14 3283 SIR TOBY.
14 3284 You, sir! why, what are you?
14 3285 
14 3286 ANTONIO.
14 3287 One, sir, that for his love dares yet do more
14 3288 Than you have heard him brag to you he will.
14 3289 
14 3290 SIR TOBY.
14 3291 Nay, if you be an undertaker, I am for you.
14 3292 
14 3293 [Draws.]
14 3294 
14 3295 [Enter two Officers.]
14 3296 
14 3297 FABIAN. O good Sir Toby, hold; here come the officers.
14 3298 
14 3299 SIR TOBY.
14 3300 [To ANTONIO] I'll be with you anon.
14 3301 
14 3302 VIOLA.
14 3303 [To Sir Andrew.] Pray, sir, put your sword up, if you please.
14 3304 
14 3305 SIR ANDREW.
14 3306 Marry, will I, sir; and for that I promised you, I'll be
14 3307 as good as my word. He will bear you easily and reins well.
14 3308 
14 3309 FIRST OFFICER.
14 3310 This is the man; do thy office.
14 3311 
14 3312 SECOND OFFICER.
14 3313 Antonio, I arrest thee at the suit
14 3314 Of Count Orsino.
14 3315 
14 3316 ANTONIO.
14 3317 You do mistake me, sir.
14 3318 
14 3319 FIRST OFFICER.
14 3320 No, sir, no jot; I know your favour well,
14 3321 Though now you have no sea-cap on your head.--
14 3322 Take him away; he knows I know him well.
14 3323 
14 3324 ANTONIO.
14 3325 I Must obey.--This comes with seeking you;
14 3326 But there's no remedy; I shall answer it.
14 3327 What will you do? Now my necessity
14 3328 Makes me to ask you for my purse. It grieves me
14 3329 Much more for what I cannot do for you
14 3330 Than what befalls myself. You stand amazed;
14 3331 But be of comfort.
14 3332 
14 3333 SECOND OFFICER.
14 3334 Come, sir, away.
14 3335 
14 3336 ANTONIO.
14 3337 I must entreat of you some of that money.
14 3338 
14 3339 VIOLA.
14 3340 What money, sir?
14 3341 For the fair kindness you have showed me here,
14 3342 And part being prompted by your present trouble,
14 3343 Out of my lean and low ability
14 3344 I'll lend you something; my having is not much;
14 3345 I'll make division of my present with you:
14 3346 Hold, there is half my coffer.
14 3347 
14 3348 ANTONIO.
14 3349 Will you deny me now?
14 3350 Is't possible that my deserts to you
14 3351 Can lack persuasion? Do not tempt my misery,
14 3352 Lest that it make me so unsound a man
14 3353 As to upbraid you with those kindnesses
14 3354 That I have done for you.
14 3355 
14 3356 VIOLA.
14 3357 I know of none,
14 3358 Nor know I you by voice or any feature:
14 3359 I hate ingratitude more in a man
14 3360 Than lying, vainness, babbling, drunkenness,
14 3361 Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption
14 3362 Inhabits our frail blood.
14 3363 
14 3364 ANTONIO.
14 3365 O heavens themselves!
14 3366 
14 3367 SECOND OFFICER.
14 3368 Come, sir, I pray you go.
14 3369 
14 3370 ANTONIO.
14 3371 Let me speak a little. This youth that you see here
14 3372 I snatched one half out of the jaws of death,
14 3373 Relieved him with such sanctity of love,--
14 3374 And to his image, which methought did promise
14 3375 Most venerable worth, did I devotion.
14 3376 
14 3377 FIRST OFFICER.
14 3378 What's that to us? The time goes by; away.
14 3379 
14 3380 ANTONIO.
14 3381 But O how vile an idol proves this god!
14 3382 Thou hast, Sebastian, done good feature shame.
14 3383 In nature there's no blemish but the mind;
14 3384 None can be call'd deform'd but the unkind:
14 3385 Virtue is beauty; but the beauteous-evil
14 3386 Are empty trunks, o'erflourished by the devil.
14 3387 
14 3388 FIRST OFFICER.
14 3389 The man grows mad; away with him. Come, come, sir.
14 3390 
14 3391 ANTONIO.
14 3392 Lead me on.
14 3393 
14 3394 [Exeunt Officers with ANTONIO.]
14 3395 
14 3396 VIOLA.
14 3397 Methinks his words do from such passion fly
14 3398 That he believes himself; so do not I.
14 3399 Prove true, imagination; O prove true,
14 3400 That I, dear brother, be now ta'en for you!
14 3401 
14 3402 SIR TOBY.
14 3403 Come hither, knight; come hither, Fabian; we'll whisper
14 3404 o'er a couplet or two of most sage saws.
14 3405 
14 3406 VIOLA.
14 3407 He named Sebastian; I my brother know
14 3408 Yet living in my glass; even such and so
14 3409 In favour was my brother; and he went
14 3410 Still in this fashion, colour, ornament,
14 3411 For him I imitate. O, if it prove,
14 3412 Tempests are kind, and salt waves fresh in love!
14 3413 
14 3414 [Exit.]
14 3415 
14 3416 SIR TOBY.
14 3417 A very dishonest paltry boy, and more a coward than a
14 3418 hare: his dishonesty appears in leaving his friend here in
14 3419 necessity, and denying him; and for his cowardship, ask Fabian.
14 3420 
14 3421 FABIAN.
14 3422 A coward, a most devout coward, religious in it.
14 3423 
14 3424 SIR ANDREW.
14 3425 'Slid, I'll after him again and beat him.
14 3426 
14 3427 SIR TOBY.
14 3428 Do, cuff him soundly, but never draw thy sword.
14 3429 
14 3430 SIR ANDREW.
14 3431 And I do not,--
14 3432 
14 3433 [Exit.]
14 3434 
14 3435 FABIAN.
14 3436 Come, let's see the event.
14 3437 
14 3438 SIR TOBY.
14 3439 I dare lay any money 'twill be nothing yet.

14 3452 Will you make me believe that I am not sent for you?
14 3453 
14 3454 SEBASTIAN.
14 3455 Go to, go to, thou art a foolish fellow;
14 3456 Let me be clear of thee.
14 3457 
14 3458 CLOWN.
14 3459 Well held out, i' faith! No, I do not know you; nor I am not
14 3460 sent to you by my lady, to bid you come speak with her; nor your
14 3461 name is not Master Cesario; nor this is not my nose neither.--
14 3462 Nothing that is so is so.
14 3463 
14 3464 SEBASTIAN.
14 3465 I pr'ythee vent thy folly somewhere else. Thou know'st not me.
14 3466 
14 3467 CLOWN.
14 3468 Vent my folly! he has heard that word of some great man, and
14 3469 now applies it to a fool. Vent my folly! I am afraid this great
14 3470 lubber, the world, will prove a cockney.--I pr'ythee now, ungird
14 3471 thy strangeness, and tell me what I shall vent to my lady. Shall
14 3472 I vent to her that thou art coming?
14 3473 
14 3474 SEBASTIAN.
14 3475 I pr'ythee, foolish Greek, depart from me;
14 3476 There's money for thee; if you tarry longer
14 3477 I shall give worse payment.
14 3478 
14 3479 CLOWN.
14 3480 By my troth, thou hast an open hand:--These wise men that
14 3481 give fools money get themselves a good report after fourteen
14 3482 years' purchase.
14 3483 
14 3484 [Enter SIR ANDREW, SIR TOBY, and FABIAN.]
14 3485 
14 3486 SIR ANDREW.
14 3487 Now, sir, have I met you again? there's for you.
14 3488 
14 3489 [Striking SEBASTIAN.]
14 3490 
14 3491 SEBASTIAN.
14 3492 Why, there's for thee, and there, and there.
14 3493 Are all the people mad?
14 3494 
14 3495 [Beating SIR ANDREW.]
14 3496 
14 3497 SIR TOBY.
14 3498 Hold, sir, or I'll throw your dagger o'er the house.
14 3499 
14 3500 CLOWN.
14 3501 This will I tell my lady straight. I would not be in some of
14 3502 your coats for twopence.
14 3503 
14 3504 [Exit CLOWN.]
14 3505 
14 3506 SIR TOBY.
14 3507 Come on, sir; hold.
14 3508 
14 3509 [Holding SEBASTIAN.]
14 3510 
14 3511 SIR ANDREW.
14 3512 Nay, let him alone; I'll go another way to work with
14 3513 him; I'll have an action of battery against him, if there be any
14 3514 law in Illyria: though I struck him first, yet it's no matter for
14 3515 that.
14 3516 
14 3517 SEBASTIAN.
14 3518 Let go thy hand.
14 3519 
14 3520 SIR TOBY.
14 3521 Come, sir, I will not let you go. Come, my young soldier,
14 3522 put up your iron: you are well fleshed; come on.
14 3523 
14 3524 SEBASTIAN.
14 3525 I will be free from thee. What wouldst thou now?
14 3526 If thou dar'st tempt me further, draw thy sword.
14 3527 
14 3528 [Draws.]
14 3529 
14 3530 SIR TOBY.
14 3531 What, what? Nay, then I must have an ounce or two of this
14 3532 malapert blood from you.
14 3533 
14 3534 [Draws.]
14 3535 
14 3536 [Enter OLIVIA.]
14 3537 
14 3538 OLIVIA.
14 3539 Hold, Toby; on thy life, I charge thee hold.
14 3540 
14 3541 SIR TOBY.
14 3542 Madam?
14 3543 
14 3544 OLIVIA.
14 3545 Will it be ever thus? Ungracious wretch,
14 3546 Fit for the mountains and the barbarous caves,
14 3547 Where manners ne'er were preach'd! Out of my sight!
14 3548 Be not offended, dear Cesario!--
14 3549 Rudesby, be gone!--I pr'ythee, gentle friend,
14 3550 
14 3551 [Exeunt SIR TOBY, SIR ANDREW, and FABIAN.]
14 3552 
14 3553 Let thy fair wisdom, not thy passion, sway
14 3554 In this uncivil and unjust extent
14 3555 Against thy peace. Go with me to my house,
14 3556 And hear thou there how many fruitless pranks
14 3557 This ruffian hath botch'd up, that thou thereby
14 3558 Mayst smile at this: thou shalt not choose but go;
14 3559 Do not deny. Beshrew his soul for me,
14 3560 He started one poor heart of mine in thee.
14 3561 
14 3562 SEBASTIAN.
14 3563 What relish is in this? how runs the stream?
14 3564 Or I am mad/ or else this is a dream:--
14 3565 Let fancy still my sense in Lethe steep;
14 3566 If it be thus to dream, still let me sleep!
14 3567 
14 3568 OLIVIA.
14 3569 Nay, come, I pr'ythee. Would thou'dst be ruled by me!
14 3570 
14 3571 SEBASTIAN.
14 3572 Madam, I will.
14 3573 
14 3574 OLIVIA.
14 3575 O, say so, and so be!
14 3576 
14 3577 [Exeunt.]

14 3580 
14 3581 SCENE II. A Room in OLIVIA'S House.
14 3582 
14 3583 [Enter MARIA and CLOWN.]
14 3584 
14 3585 MARIA.
14 3586 Nay, I pr'ythee, put on this gown and this beard; make him
14 3587 believe thou art Sir Topas the curate; do it quickly: I'll call
14 3588 Sir Toby the whilst.
14 3589 
14 3590 [Exit MARIA.]
14 3591 
14 3592 CLOWN.
14 3593 Well, I'll put it on, and I will dissemble myself in't; and
14 3594 I would I were the first that ever dissembled in such a gown. I
14 3595 am not tall enough to become the function well: nor lean enough
14 3596 to be thought a good student: but to be said, an honest man and a
14 3597 good housekeeper, goes as fairly as to say, a careful man and a
14 3598 great scholar. The competitors enter.
14 3599 
14 3600 [Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and MARIA.]
14 3601 
14 3602 SIR TOBY.
14 3603 Jove bless thee, Master Parson.
14 3604 
14 3605 CLOWN.
14 3606 Bonos dies, Sir Toby: for as the old hermit of Prague, that
14 3607 never saw pen and ink, very wittily said to a niece of King
14 3608 Gorboduc, 'That that is, is'; so I, being master parson, am
14 3609 master parson: for what is that but that? and is but is?
14 3610 
14 3611 SIR TOBY.
14 3612 To him, Sir Topas.
14 3613 
14 3614 CLOWN.
14 3615 What, hoa, I say,--Peace in this prison!
14 3616 
14 3617 SIR TOBY.
14 3618 The knave counterfeits well; a good knave.
14 3619 
14 3620 MALVOLIO.
14 3621 [In an inner chamber.] Who calls there?
14 3622 
14 3623 CLOWN.
14 3624 Sir Topas the curate, who comes to visit Malvolio the
14 3625 lunatic.
14 3626 
14 3627 MALVOLIO.
14 3628 Sir Topas, Sir Topas, good Sir Topas, go to my lady.
14 3629 
14 3630 CLOWN.
14 3631 Out, hyperbolical fiend! how vexest thou this man? talkest thou
14 3632 nothing but of ladies?
14 3633 
14 3634 SIR TOBY.
14 3635 Well said, master parson.
14 3636 
14 3637 MALVOLIO.
14 3638 Sir Topas, never was man thus wronged: good Sir Topas, do
14 3639 not think I am mad; they have laid me here in hideous darkness.
14 3640 
14 3641 CLOWN.
14 3642 Fie, thou dishonest Sathan! I call thee by the most modest
14 3643 terms; for I am one of those gentle ones that will use the devil
14 3644 himself with courtesy. Say'st thou that house is dark?
14 3645 
14 3646 MALVOLIO.
14 3647 As hell, Sir Topas.
14 3648 
14 3649 CLOWN.
14 3650 Why, it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes, and the
14 3651 clear storeys toward the south-north are as lustrous as ebony;
14 3652 and yet complainest thou of obstruction?
14 3653 
14 3654 MALVOLIO.
14 3655 I am not mad, Sir Topas; I say to you this house is dark.
14 3656 
14 3657 CLOWN.
14 3658 Madman, thou errest. I say there is no darkness but
14 3659 ignorance; in which thou art more puzzled than the Egyptians in
14 3660 their fog.
14 3661 
14 3662 MALVOLIO.
14 3663 I say this house is as dark as ignorance, though
14 3664 ignorance were as dark as hell; and I say there was never man
14 3665 thus abused. I am no more mad than you are; make the trial of it
14 3666 in any constant question.
14 3667 
14 3668 CLOWN.
14 3669 What is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning wild-fowl?
14 3670 
14 3671 MALVOLIO.
14 3672 That the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit a bird.
14 3673 
14 3674 CLOWN.
14 3675 What thinkest thou of his opinion?
14 3676 
14 3677 MALVOLIO.
14 3678 I think nobly of the soul, and no way approve his opinion.
14 3679 
14 3680 CLOWN.
14 3681 Fare thee well. Remain thou still in darkness: thou shalt
14 3682  hold the opinion of Pythagoras ere I will allow of thy wits; and
14 3683 fear to kill a woodcock, lest thou dispossess the soul of thy
14 3684 grandam. Fare thee well.
14 3685 
14 3686 MALVOLIO.
14 3687 Sir Topas, Sir Topas!
14 3688 
14 3689 SIR TOBY.
14 3690 My most exquisite Sir Topas!
14 3691 
14 3692 CLOWN.
14 3693 Nay, I am for all waters.
14 3694 
14 3695 MARIA.
14 3696 Thou mightst have done this without thy beard and gown: he
14 3697 sees thee not.
14 3698 
14 3699 SIR TOBY.
14 3700 To him in thine own voice, and bring me word how thou
14 3701 findest him; I would we were well rid of this knavery. If he may
14 3702 be conveniently delivered, I would he were; for I am now so far
14 3703 in offence with my niece that I cannot pursue with any safety
14 3704 this sport to the upshot. Come by and by to my chamber.
14 3705 
14 3706 [Exeunt SIR TOBY and MARIA.]
14 3707 
14 3708 CLOWN.
14 3709 [Singing.] 'Hey, Robin, jolly Robin,
14 3710 Tell me how thy lady does.'
14 3711 
14 3712 MALVOLIO.
14 3713 Fool,--
14 3714 
14 3715 CLOWN.
14 3716 'My lady is unkind, perdy.'
14 3717 
14 3718 MALVOLIO.
14 3719 Fool,--
14 3720 
14 3721 CLOWN.
14 3722 'Alas, why is she so?'
14 3723 
14 3724 MALVOLIO.
14 3725 Fool, I say;--
14 3726 
14 3727 CLOWN.
14 3728 'She loves another'--Who calls, ha?
14 3729 
14 3730 MALVOLIO.
14 3731 Good fool, as ever thou wilt deserve well at my hand,
14 3732 help me to a candle, and pen, ink, and paper; as I am a
14 3733 gentleman, I will live to be thankful to thee for't.
14 3734 
14 3735 CLOWN.
14 3736 Master Malvolio!
14 3737 
14 3738 MALVOLIO.
14 3739 Ay, good fool.
14 3740 
14 3741 CLOWN.
14 3742 Alas, sir, how fell you besides your five wits?
14 3743 
14 3744 MALVOLIO.
14 3745 Fool, there was never man so notoriously abused; I am as well in
14 3746 my wits, fool, as thou art.
14 3747 
14 3748 CLOWN.
14 3749 But as well? then you are mad indeed, if you be no better in
14 3750 your wits than a fool.
14 3751 
14 3752 MALVOLIO.
14 3753 They have here propertied me; keep me in darkness, send
14 3754 ministers to me, asses, and do all they can to face me out of my
14 3755 wits.
14 3756 
14 3757 CLOWN.
14 3758 Advise you what you say: the minister is here.--Malvolio, thy
14 3759 wits the heavens restore! endeavour thyself to sleep, and leave
14 3760 thy vain bibble-babble.
14 3761 
14 3762 MALVOLIO.
14 3763 Sir Topas,--
14 3764 
14 3765 CLOWN.
14 3766 Maintain no words with him, good fellow. Who, I, sir? not
14 3767 I, sir. God b' wi' you, good Sir Topas.--Marry, amen.--I will
14 3768 sir, I will.
14 3769 
14 3770 MALVOLIO.
14 3771 Fool, fool, fool, I say,--
14 3772 
14 3773 CLOWN.
14 3774 Alas, sir, be patient. What say you, sir? I am shent for
14 3775 speaking to you.
14 3776 
14 3777 MALVOLIO.
14 3778 Good fool, help me to some light and some paper;
14 3779 I tell thee I am as well in my wits as any man in Illyria.
14 3780 
14 3781 CLOWN.
14 3782 Well-a-day,--that you were, sir!
14 3783 
14 3784 MALVOLIO.
14 3785 By this hand, I am: Good fool, some ink, paper, and
14 3786 light, and convey what I will set down to my lady; it shall
14 3787 advantage thee more than ever the bearing of letter did.
14 3788 
14 3789 CLOWN.
14 3790 I will help you to't. But tell me true, are you not mad
14 3791 indeed? or do you but counterfeit?
14 3792 
14 3793 MALVOLIO.
14 3794 Believe me, I am not; I tell thee true.
14 3795 
14 3796 CLOWN.
14 3797 Nay, I'll ne'er believe a madman till I see his brains.
14 3798 I will fetch you light, and paper, and ink.
14 3799 
14 3800 MALVOLIO.
14 3801 Fool, I'll requite it in the highest degree: I pr'ythee be
14 3802 gone.
14 3803 
14 3804 CLOWN.
14 3805 [Singing.]
14 3806    'I am gone, sir,
14 3807    And anon, sir,
14 3808   I'll be with you again,
14 3809    In a trice,
14 3810    Like to the old vice,
14 3811   Your need to sustain;
14 3812 
14 3813   Who with dagger of lath,
14 3814   In his rage and his wrath,
14 3815    Cries ah, ha! to the devil:
14 3816   Like a mad lad,
14 3817   Pare thy nails, dad.
14 3818    Adieu, goodman drivel.

14 3826 [Enter SEBASTIAN.]
14 3827 
14 3828 SEBASTIAN.
14 3829 This is the air; that is the glorious sun;
14 3830 This pearl she gave me, I do feel't and see't:
14 3831 And though 'tis wonder that enwraps me thus,
14 3832 Yet 'tis not madness. Where's Antonio, then?
14 3833 I could not find him at the Elephant;
14 3834 Yet there he was; and there I found this credit,
14 3835 That he did range the town to seek me out.
14 3836 His counsel now might do me golden service;
14 3837 For though my soul disputes well with my sense,
14 3838 That this may be some error, but no madness,
14 3839 Yet doth this accident and flood of fortune
14 3840 So far exceed all instance, all discourse,
14 3841 That I am ready to distrust mine eyes
14 3842 And wrangle with my reason, that persuades me
14 3843 To any other trust but that I am mad,
14 3844 Or else the lady's mad; yet if 'twere so,
14 3845 She could not sway her house, command her followers,
14 3846 Take and give back affairs and their despatch
14 3847 With such a smooth, discreet, and stable bearing,
14 3848 As I perceive she does: there's something in't
14 3849 That is deceivable. But here comes the lady.
14 3850 
14 3851 [Enter OLIVIA and a Priest.]
14 3852 
14 3853 OLIVIA.
14 3854 Blame not this haste of mine. If you mean well,
14 3855 Now go with me and with this holy man
14 3856 Into the chantry by: there, before him
14 3857 And underneath that consecrated roof,
14 3858 Plight me the full assurance of your faith,
14 3859 That my most jealous and too doubtful soul
14 3860 May live at peace. He shall conceal it
14 3861 Whiles you are willing it shall come to note;
14 3862 What time we will our celebration keep
14 3863 According to my birth.--What do you say?
14 3864 
14 3865 SEBASTIAN.
14 3866 I'll follow this good man, and go with you;
14 3867 And, having sworn truth, ever will be true.
14 3868 
14 3869 OLIVIA.
14 3870 Then lead the way, good father;--And heavens so shine
14 3871 That they may fairly note this act of mine!

14 3880 
14 3881 [Enter CLOWN and FABIAN.]
14 3882 
14 3883 FABIAN.
14 3884 Now, as thou lovest me, let me see his letter.
14 3885 
14 3886 CLOWN.
14 3887 Good Master Fabian, grant me another request.
14 3888 
14 3889 FABIAN.
14 3890 Anything.
14 3891 
14 3892 CLOWN.
14 3893 Do not desire to see this letter.
14 3894 
14 3895 FABIAN.
14 3896 This is to give a dog; and in recompense desire my dog again.
14 3897 
14 3898 [Enter DUKE, VIOLA, and Attendants.]
14 3899 
14 3900 DUKE.
14 3901 Belong you to the Lady Olivia, friends?
14 3902 
14 3903 CLOWN.
14 3904 Ay, sir; we are some of her trappings.
14 3905 
14 3906 DUKE.
14 3907 I know thee well. How dost thou, my good fellow?
14 3908 
14 3909 CLOWN.
14 3910 Truly, sir, the better for my foes and the worse for my friends.
14 3911 
14 3912 DUKE.
14 3913 Just the contrary; the better for thy friends.
14 3914 
14 3915 CLOWN.
14 3916 No, sir, the worse.
14 3917 
14 3918 DUKE.
14 3919 How can that be?
14 3920 
14 3921 CLOWN.
14 3922 Marry, sir, they praise me and make an ass of me; now my
14 3923 foes tell me plainly I am an ass: so that by my foes, sir, I
14 3924 profit in the knowledge of myself, and by my friends I am abused:
14 3925 so that, conclusions to be as kisses, if your four negatives make
14 3926 your two affirmatives, why then, the worse for my friends and
14 3927 the better for my foes.
14 3928 
14 3929 DUKE.
14 3930 Why, this is excellent.
14 3931 
14 3932 CLOWN.
14 3933 By my troth, sir, no; though it please you to be one of my
14 3934 friends.
14 3935 
14 3936 DUKE.
14 3937 Thou shalt not be the worse for me; there's gold.
14 3938 
14 3939 CLOWN.
14 3940 But that it would be double-dealing, sir, I would you could
14 3941 make it another.
14 3942 
14 3943 DUKE.
14 3944 O, you give me ill counsel.
14 3945 
14 3946 CLOWN.
14 3947 Put your grace in your pocket, sir, for this once, and let
14 3948 your flesh and blood obey it.
14 3949 
14 3950 DUKE.
14 3951 Well, I will be so much a sinner to be a double-dealer: there's
14 3952 another.
14 3953 
14 3954 CLOWN.
14 3955 Primo, secundo, tertio, is a good play; and the old saying
14 3956 is, the third pays for all; the triplex, sir, is a good tripping
14 3957 measure; or the bells of Saint Bennet, sir, may put you in mind;
14 3958 one, two, three.
14 3959 
14 3960 DUKE.
14 3961 You can fool no more money out of me at this throw: if you
14 3962 will let your lady know I am here to speak with her, and bring
14 3963 her along with you, it may awake my bounty further.
14 3964 
14 3965 CLOWN.
14 3966 Marry, sir, lullaby to your bounty till I come again. I go,
14 3967 sir; but I would not have you to think that my desire of having
14 3968 is the sin of covetousness: but, as you say, sir, let your bounty
14 3969 take a nap; I will awake it anon.
14 3970 
14 3971 [Exit CLOWN.]
14 3972 
14 3973 [Enter ANTONIO and Officers.]
14 3974 
14 3975 VIOLA.
14 3976 Here comes the man, sir, that did rescue me.
14 3977 
14 3978 DUKE.
14 3979 That face of his I do remember well:
14 3980 Yet when I saw it last it was besmeared
14 3981 As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war:
14 3982 A bawbling vessel was he captain of,
14 3983 For shallow draught and bulk unprizable;
14 3984 With which such scathful grapple did he make
14 3985 With the most noble bottom of our fleet
14 3986 That very envy and the tongue of los
14 3987 Cried fame and honour on him.--What's the matter?
14 3988 
14 3989 FIRST OFFICER.
14 3990 Orsino, this is that Antonio
14 3991 That took the Phoenix and her fraught from Candy:
14 3992 And this is he that did the Tiger board
14 3993 When your young nephew Titus lost his leg:
14 3994 Here in the streets, desperate of shame and state,
14 3995 In private brabble did we apprehend him.
14 3996 
14 3997 VIOLA.
14 3998 He did me kindness, sir; drew on my side;
14 3999 But, in conclusion, put strange speech upon me.
14 4000 I know not what 'twas, but distraction.
14 4001 
14 4002 DUKE.
14 4003 Notable pirate! thou salt-water thief!
14 4004 What foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies,
14 4005 Whom thou, in terms so bloody and so dear,
14 4006 Hast made thine enemies?
14 4007 
14 4008 ANTONIO.
14 4009 Orsino, noble sir,
14 4010 Be pleased that I shake off these names you give me:
14 4011 Antonio never yet was thief or pirate,
14 4012 Though, I confess, on base and ground enough,
14 4013 Orsino's enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither:
14 4014 That most ingrateful boy there, by your side
14 4015 From the rude sea's enraged and foamy mouth
14 4016 Did I redeem; a wreck past hope he was:
14 4017 His life I gave him, and did thereto add
14 4018 My love, without retention or restraint,
14 4019 All his in dedication: for his sake,
14 4020 Did I expose myself, pure for his love,
14 4021 Into the danger of this adverse town;
14 4022 Drew to defend him when he was beset:
14 4023 Where being apprehended, his false cunning,--
14 4024 Not meaning to partake with me in danger,--
14 4025 Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance,
14 4026 And grew a twenty-years-removed thing
14 4027 While one would wink; denied me mine own purse,
14 4028 Which I had recommended to his use
14 4029 Not half an hour before.
14 4030 
14 4031 VIOLA.
14 4032 How can this be?
14 4033 
14 4034 DUKE.
14 4035 When came he to this town?
14 4036 
14 4037 ANTONIO.
14 4038 To-day, my lord; and for three months before,--
14 4039 No interim, not a minute's vacancy,--
14 4040 Both day and night did we keep company.
14 4041 
14 4042 [Enter OLIVIA and Attendants.]
14 4043 
14 4044 DUKE.
14 4045 Here comes the countess; now heaven walks on earth.--
14 4046 But for thee, fellow, fellow, thy words are madness:
14 4047 Three months this youth hath tended upon me;
14 4048 But more of that anon.--Take him aside.
14 4049 
14 4050 OLIVIA.
14 4051 What would my lord, but that he may not have,
14 4052 Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable!--
14 4053 Cesario, you do not keep promise with me.
14 4054 
14 4055 VIOLA.
14 4056 Madam?
14 4057 
14 4058 DUKE.
14 4059 Gracious Olivia,--
14 4060 
14 4061 OLIVIA.
14 4062 What do you say, Cesario?--Good my lord,--
14 4063 
14 4064 VIOLA.
14 4065 My lord would speak, my duty hushes me.
14 4066 
14 4067 OLIVIA.
14 4068 If it be aught to the old tune, my lord,
14 4069 It is as fat and fulsome to mine ear
14 4070 As howling after music.
14 4071 
14 4072 DUKE.
14 4073 Still so cruel?
14 4074 
14 4075 OLIVIA.
14 4076 Still so constant, lord.
14 4077 
14 4078 DUKE.
14 4079 What! to perverseness? you uncivil lady,
14 4080 To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars
14 4081 My soul the faithfull'st offerings hath breathed out
14 4082 That e'er devotion tender'd! What shall I do?
14 4083 
14 4084 OLIVIA.
14 4085 Even what it please my lord, that shall become him.
14 4086 
14 4087 DUKE.
14 4088 Why should I not, had I the heart to do it.
14 4089 Like to the Egyptian thief, at point of death,
14 4090 Kill what I love; a savage jealousy
14 4091 That sometime savours nobly.--But hear me this:
14 4092 Since you to non-regardance cast my faith,
14 4093 And that I partly know the instrument
14 4094 That screws me from my true place in your favour,
14 4095 Live you the marble-breasted tyrant still;
14 4096 But this your minion, whom I know you love,
14 4097 And whom, by heaven I swear, I tender dearly,
14 4098 Him will I tear out of that cruel eye
14 4099 Where he sits crowned in his master's sprite.--
14 4100 Come, boy, with me; my thoughts are ripe in mischief:
14 4101 I'll sacrifice the lamb that I do love,
14 4102 To spite a raven's heart within a dove.
14 4103 
14 4104 [Going.]
14 4105 
14 4106 VIOLA.
14 4107 And I, most jocund, apt, and willingly,
14 4108 To do you rest, a thousand deaths would die.
14 4109 
14 4110 OLIVIA.
14 4111 Where goes Cesario?
14 4112 
14 4113 VIOLA.
14 4114 After him I love
14 4115 More than I love these eyes, more than my life,
14 4116 More, by all mores, than e'er I shall love wife;
14 4117 If I do feign, you witnesses above
14 4118 Punish my life for tainting of my love!
14 4119 
14 4120 OLIVIA.
14 4121 Ah me, detested! how am I beguil'd!
14 4122 
14 4123 VIOLA.
14 4124 Who does beguile you? who does do you wrong?
14 4125 
14 4126 OLIVIA.
14 4127 Hast thou forgot thyself? Is it so long?--
14 4128 Call forth the holy father.
14 4129 
14 4130 [Exit an ATTENDANT.]
14 4131 
14 4132 DUKE.
14 4133 [To Viola.] Come, away!
14 4134 
14 4135 OLIVIA.
14 4136 Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.
14 4137 
14 4138 DUKE.
14 4139 Husband?
14 4140 
14 4141 OLIVIA.
14 4142 Ay, husband, can he that deny?
14 4143 
14 4144 DUKE.
14 4145 Her husband, sirrah?
14 4146 
14 4147 VIOLA.
14 4148 No, my lord, not I.
14 4149 
14 4150 OLIVIA.
14 4151 Alas, it is the baseness of thy fear
14 4152 That makes thee strangle thy propriety:
14 4153 Fear not, Cesario, take thy fortunes up;
14 4154 Be that thou know'st thou art, and then thou art
14 4155 As great as that thou fear'st--O, welcome, father!
14 4156 
14 4157 [Re-enter Attendant and Priest.]
14 4158 
14 4159 Father, I charge thee, by thy reverence,
14 4160 Here to unfold,--though lately we intended
14 4161 To keep in darkness what occasion now
14 4162 Reveals before 'tis ripe,--what thou dost know
14 4163 Hath newly passed between this youth and me.
14 4164 
14 4165 PRIEST.
14 4166 A contract of eternal bond of love,
14 4167 Confirmed by mutual joinder of your hands,
14 4168 Attested by the holy close of lips,
14 4169 Strengthen'd by interchangement of your rings;
14 4170 And all the ceremony of this compact
14 4171 Sealed in my function, by my testimony:
14 4172 Since when, my watch hath told me, toward my grave,
14 4173 I have travelled but two hours.
14 4174 
14 4175 DUKE.
14 4176 O thou dissembling cub! What wilt thou be,
14 4177 When time hath sowed a grizzle on thy case?
14 4178 Or will not else thy craft so quickly grow
14 4179 That thine own trip shall be thine overthrow?
14 4180 Farewell, and take her; but direct thy feet
14 4181 Where thou and I henceforth may never meet.
14 4182 
14 4183 VIOLA.
14 4184 My lord, I do protest,--
14 4185 
14 4186 OLIVIA.
14 4187 O, do not swear;
14 4188 Hold little faith, though thou has too much fear.
14 4189 
14 4190 [Enter SIR ANDREW AGUE-CHEEK, with his head broke.]
14 4191 
14 4192 SIR ANDREW.
14 4193 For the love of God, a surgeon; send one presently to Sir Toby.
14 4194 
14 4195 OLIVIA.
14 4196 What's the matter?
14 4197 
14 4198 SIR ANDREW.
14 4199 He has broke my head across, and has given Sir Toby a
14 4200 bloody coxcomb too: for the love of God, your help: I had rather
14 4201 than forty pound I were at home.
14 4202 
14 4203 OLIVIA.
14 4204 Who has done this, Sir Andrew?
14 4205 
14 4206 SIR ANDREW.
14 4207 The Count's gentleman, one Cesario: we took him for a
14 4208 coward, but he's the very devil incardinate.
14 4209 
14 4210 DUKE.
14 4211 My gentleman, Cesario?
14 4212 
14 4213 SIR ANDREW.
14 4214 Od's lifelings, here he is:--You broke my head for
14 4215 nothing; and that that I did, I was set on to do't by Sir Toby.
14 4216 
14 4217 
14 4218 VIOLA.
14 4219 Why do you speak to me? I never hurt you:
14 4220 You drew your sword upon me without cause;
14 4221 But I bespake you fair and hurt you not.
14 4222 
14 4223 SIR ANDREW.
14 4224 If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt, you have hurt me; I think
14 4225 you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb.
14 4226 
14 4227 [Enter SIR TOBY BELCH, drunk, led by the CLOWN.]
14 4228 
14 4229 Here comes Sir Toby halting; you shall hear more: but if he had
14 4230 not been in drink he would have tickled you othergates than he
14 4231 did.
14 4232 
14 4233 DUKE.
14 4234 How now, gentleman? how is't with you?
14 4235 
14 4236 SIR TOBY.
14 4237 That's all one; he has hurt me, and there's the end on't.--
14 4238 Sot, didst see Dick Surgeon, sot?
14 4239 
14 4240 CLOWN.
14 4241 O, he's drunk, Sir Toby, an hour agone; his eyes were set at
14 4242 eight i' the morning.
14 4243 
14 4244 SIR TOBY.
14 4245 Then he's a rogue. After a passy-measure, or a pavin, I hate a
14 4246 drunken rogue.
14 4247 
14 4248 OLIVIA.
14 4249 Away with him. Who hath made this havoc with them?
14 4250 
14 4251 SIR ANDREW.
14 4252 I'll help you, Sir Toby, because we'll be dressed together.
14 4253 
14 4254 SIR TOBY.
14 4255 Will you help an ass-head, and a coxcomb, and a knave? a
14 4256 thin-faced knave, a gull?
14 4257 
14 4258 OLIVIA.
14 4259 Get him to bed, and let his hurt be looked to.
14 4260 
14 4261 [Exeunt CLOWN, SIR TOBY, and SIR ANDREW.]
14 4262 
14 4263 [Enter SEBASTIAN.]
14 4264 
14 4265 SEBASTIAN.
14 4266 I am sorry, madam, I have hurt your kinsman;
14 4267 But, had it been the brother of my blood,
14 4268 I must have done no less, with wit and safety.
14 4269 You throw a strange regard upon me, and by that
14 4270 I do perceive it hath offended you;
14 4271 Pardon me, sweet one, even for the vows
14 4272 We made each other but so late ago.
14 4273 
14 4274 DUKE.
14 4275 One face, one voice, one habit, and two persons;
14 4276 A natural perspective, that is, and is not.
14 4277 
14 4278 SEBASTIAN.
14 4279 Antonio, O my dear Antonio!
14 4280 How have the hours rack'd and tortur'd me
14 4281 Since I have lost thee.
14 4282 
14 4283 ANTONIO.
14 4284 Sebastian are you?
14 4285 
14 4286 SEBASTIAN.
14 4287 Fear'st thou that, Antonio?
14 4288 
14 4289 ANTONIO.
14 4290 How have you made division of yourself?--
14 4291 An apple, cleft in two, is not more twin
14 4292 Than these two creatures. Which is Sebastian?
14 4293 
14 4294 OLIVIA.
14 4295 Most wonderful!
14 4296 
14 4297 SEBASTIAN.
14 4298 Do I stand there? I never had a brother:
14 4299 Nor can there be that deity in my nature
14 4300 Of here and everywhere. I had a sister
14 4301 Whom the blind waves and surges have devoured:--
14 4302 [To Viola.] Of charity, what kin are you to me?
14 4303 What countryman, what name, what parentage?
14 4304 
14 4305 VIOLA.
14 4306 Of Messaline: Sebastian was my father;
14 4307 Such a Sebastian was my brother too:
14 4308 So went he suited to his watery tomb:
14 4309 If spirits can assume both form and suit,
14 4310 You come to fright us.
14 4311 
14 4312 SEBASTIAN.
14 4313 A spirit I am indeed:
14 4314 But am in that dimension grossly clad,
14 4315 Which from the womb I did participate.
14 4316 Were you a woman, as the rest goes even,
14 4317 I should my tears let fall upon your cheek,
14 4318 And say--Thrice welcome, drowned Viola!
14 4319 
14 4320 VIOLA.
14 4321 My father had a mole upon his brow.
14 4322 
14 4323 SEBASTIAN.
14 4324 And so had mine.
14 4325 
14 4326 VIOLA.
14 4327 And died that day when Viola from her birth
14 4328 Had numbered thirteen years.
14 4329 
14 4330 SEBASTIAN.
14 4331 O, that record is lively in my soul!
14 4332 He finished, indeed, his mortal act
14 4333 That day that made my sister thirteen years.
14 4334 
14 4335 VIOLA.
14 4336 If nothing lets to make us happy both
14 4337 But this my masculine usurp'd attire,
14 4338 Do not embrace me till each circumstance
14 4339 Of place, time, fortune, do cohere, and jump
14 4340 That I am Viola: which to confirm,
14 4341 I'll bring you to a captain in this town,
14 4342 Where lie my maiden weeds; by whose gentle help
14 4343 I was preserv'd to serve this noble count;
14 4344 All the occurrence of my fortune since
14 4345 Hath been between this lady and this lord.
14 4346 
14 4347 SEBASTIAN.
14 4348 [To OLIVIA] So comes it, lady, you have been mistook:
14 4349 But nature to her bias drew in that.
14 4350 You would have been contracted to a maid;
14 4351 Nor are you therein, by my life, deceived;
14 4352 You are betroth'd both to a maid and man.
14 4353 
14 4354 DUKE.
14 4355 Be not amazed; right noble is his blood.--
14 4356 If this be so, as yet the glass seems true,
14 4357 I shall have share in this most happy wreck:
14 4358 [To VIOLA] Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times,
14 4359 Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.
14 4360 
14 4361 VIOLA.
14 4362 And all those sayings will I over-swear;
14 4363 And all those swearings keep as true in soul
14 4364 As doth that orbed continent the fire
14 4365 That severs day from night.
14 4366 
14 4367 DUKE.
14 4368 Give me thy hand;
14 4369 And let me see thee in thy woman's weeds.
14 4370 
14 4371 VIOLA.
14 4372 The captain that did bring me first on shore
14 4373 Hath my maid's garments: he, upon some action,
14 4374 Is now in durance, at Malvolio's suit;
14 4375 A gentleman and follower of my lady's.
14 4376 
14 4377 OLIVIA.
14 4378 He shall enlarge him:--Fetch Malvolio hither:--
14 4379 And yet, alas, now I remember me,
14 4380 They say, poor gentleman, he's much distract.
14 4381 
14 4382 [Re-enter CLOWN, with a letter.]
14 4383 
14 4384 A most extracting frenzy of mine own
14 4385 From my remembrance clearly banished his.--
14 4386 How does he, sirrah?
14 4387 
14 4388 CLOWN.
14 4389 Truly, madam, he holds Belzebub at the stave's end as well
14 4390 as a man in his case may do: he has here writ a letter to you; I
14 4391 should have given it you to-day morning, but as a madman's
14 4392 epistles are no gospels, so it skills not much when they are
14 4393 delivered.
14 4394 
14 4395 OLIVIA.
14 4396 Open it, and read it.
14 4397 
14 4398 CLOWN.
14 4399 Look then to be well edified when the fool delivers the
14 4400 madman:--'By the Lord, madam,--'
14 4401 
14 4402 OLIVIA.
14 4403 How now! art thou mad?
14 4404 
14 4405 CLOWN.
14 4406 No, madam, I do but read madness: an your ladyship will have
14 4407 it as it ought to be, you must allow vox.
14 4408 
14 4409 OLIVIA.
14 4410 Pr'ythee, read i' thy right wits.
14 4411 
14 4412 CLOWN.
14 4413 So I do, madonna; but to read his right wits is to read
14 4414 thus; therefore perpend, my princess, and give ear.
14 4415 
14 4416 OLIVIA.
14 4417 [To FABIAN] Read it you, sirrah.
14 4418 
14 4419 FABIAN.
14 4420 [Reads] 'By the Lord, madam, you wrong me, and the world
14 4421 shall know it: though you have put me into darkness and given
14 4422 your drunken cousin rule over me, yet have I the benefit of my
14 4423 senses as well as your ladyship. I have your own letter that
14 4424 induced me to the semblance I put on; with the which I doubt not
14 4425 but to do myself much right or you much shame. Think of me as you
14 4426 please. I leave my duty a little unthought of, and speak out of
14 4427 my injury.

14 4431 Did he write this?
14 4432 
14 4433 CLOWN.
14 4434 Ay, madam.
14 4435 
14 4436 DUKE.
14 4437 This savours not much of distraction.

14 4439 OLIVIA.
14 4440 See him delivered, Fabian: bring him hither.
14 4441 
14 4442 [Exit FABIAN.]
14 4443 
14 4444 My lord, so please you, these things further thought on,
14 4445 To think me as well a sister as a wife,
14 4446 One day shall crown the alliance on't, so please you,
14 4447 Here at my house, and at my proper cost.
14 4448 
14 4449 DUKE.
14 4450 Madam, I am most apt to embrace your offer.--
14 4451 [To VIOLA] Your master quits you; and, for your service done him,
14 4452 So much against the mettle of your sex,
14 4453 So far beneath your soft and tender breeding,
14 4454 And since you called me master for so long,
14 4455 Here is my hand; you shall from this time be
14 4456 You master's mistress.
14 4457 
14 4458 OLIVIA.
14 4459 A sister?--you are she.
14 4460 
14 4461 [Re-enter FABIAN with MALVOLIO.]
14 4462 
14 4463 DUKE.
14 4464 Is this the madman?
14 4465 
14 4466 OLIVIA.
14 4467 Ay, my lord, this same;
14 4468 How now, Malvolio?
14 4469 
14 4470 MALVOLIO.
14 4471 Madam, you have done me wrong,
14 4472 Notorious wrong.
14 4473 
14 4474 OLIVIA.
14 4475 Have I, Malvolio? no.
14 4476 
14 4477 MALVOLIO.
14 4478 Lady, you have. Pray you peruse that letter:
14 4479 You must not now deny it is your hand,
14 4480 Write from it, if you can, in hand or phrase;
14 4481 Or say 'tis not your seal, not your invention:
14 4482 You can say none of this. Well, grant it then,
14 4483 And tell me, in the modesty of honour,
14 4484 Why you have given me such clear lights of favour;
14 4485 Bade me come smiling and cross-garter'd to you;
14 4486 To put on yellow stockings, and to frown
14 4487 Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people:
14 4488 And, acting this in an obedient hope,
14 4489 Why have you suffer'd me to be imprison'd,
14 4490 Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest,
14 4491 And made the most notorious geck and gull
14 4492 That e'er invention played on? tell me why.
14 4493 
14 4494 OLIVIA.
14 4495 Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing,
14 4496 Though, I confess, much like the character:
14 4497 But out of question, 'tis Maria's hand.
14 4498 And now I do bethink me, it was she
14 4499 First told me thou wast mad; then cam'st in smiling,
14 4500 And in such forms which here were presuppos'd
14 4501 Upon thee in the letter. Pr'ythee, be content:
14 4502 This practice hath most shrewdly pass'd upon thee:
14 4503 But, when we know the grounds and authors of it,
14 4504 Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge
14 4505 Of thine own cause.
14 4506 
14 4507 FABIAN.
14 4508 Good madam, hear me speak;
14 4509 And let no quarrel, nor no brawl to come,
14 4510 Taint the condition of this present hour,
14 4511 Which I have wonder'd at. In hope it shall not,
14 4512 Most freely I confess, myself and Toby
14 4513 Set this device against Malvolio here,
14 4514 Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts
14 4515 We had conceiv'd against him. Maria writ
14 4516 The letter, at Sir Toby's great importance;
14 4517 In recompense whereof he hath married her.
14 4518 How with a sportful malice it was follow'd
14 4519 May rather pluck on laughter than revenge,
14 4520 If that the injuries be justly weigh'd
14 4521 That have on both sides past.
14 4522 
14 4523 OLIVIA.
14 4524 Alas, poor fool! how have they baffled thee!
14 4525 
14 4526 CLOWN.
14 4527 Why, 'some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some
14 4528 have greatness thrown upon them.' I was one, sir, in this
14 4529 interlude;:--one Sir Topas, sir; but that's all one:--'By the
14 4530 Lord, fool, I am not mad;'--But do you remember? 'Madam, why
14 4531 laugh you at such a barren rascal? An you smile not, he's
14 4532 gagged'? And thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges.
14 4533 
14 4534 MALVOLIO.
14 4535 I'll be revenged on the whole pack of you.
14 4536

14 4540 He hath been most notoriously abus'd.
14 4541 
14 4542 DUKE.
14 4543 Pursue him, and entreat him to a peace:--
14 4544 He hath not told us of the captain yet;
14 4545 When that is known, and golden time convents,
14 4546 A solemn combination shall be made
14 4547 Of our dear souls.--Meantime, sweet sister,
14 4548 We will not part from hence.--Cesario, come:
14 4549 For so you shall be while you are a man;
14 4550 But, when in other habits you are seen,
14 4551 Orsino's mistress, and his fancy's queen.

14 4556       Song.
14 4557    When that I was and a little tiny boy,
14 4558      With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
14 4559    A foolish thing was but a toy,
14 4560      For the rain it raineth every day.
14 4561 
14 4562    But when I came to man's estate,
14 4563      With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
14 4564    'Gainst knave and thief men shut their gate,
14 4565      For the rain it raineth every day.
14 4566 
14 4567    But when I came, alas! to wive,
14 4568      With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
14 4569    By swaggering could I never thrive,
14 4570      For the rain it raineth every day.
14 4571 
14 4572    But when I came unto my bed,
14 4573      With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
14 4574    With toss-pots still had drunken head,
14 4575      For the rain it raineth every day.
14 4576 
14 4577    A great while ago the world begun,
14 4578      With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
14 4579    But that's all one, our play is done,
14 4580      And we'll strive to please you every day.
