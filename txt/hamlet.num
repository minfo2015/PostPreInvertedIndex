5 45 
5 46 [Francisco at his post. Enter to him Bernardo.]
5 47 
5 48 Ber.
5 49 Who's there?
5 50 
5 51 Fran.
5 52 Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.
5 53 
5 54 Ber.
5 55 Long live the king!
5 56 
5 57 Fran.
5 58 Bernardo?
5 59 
5 60 Ber.
5 61 He.
5 62 
5 63 Fran.
5 64 You come most carefully upon your hour.
5 65 
5 66 Ber.
5 67 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
5 68 
5 69 Fran.
5 70 For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
5 71 And I am sick at heart.
5 72 
5 73 Ber.
5 74 Have you had quiet guard?
5 75 
5 76 Fran.
5 77 Not a mouse stirring.
5 78 
5 79 Ber.
5 80 Well, good night.
5 81 If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
5 82 The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
5 83 
5 84 Fran.
5 85 I think I hear them.--Stand, ho! Who is there?
5 86 
5 87 [Enter Horatio and Marcellus.]
5 88 
5 89 Hor.
5 90 Friends to this ground.
5 91 
5 92 Mar.
5 93 And liegemen to the Dane.
5 94 
5 95 Fran.
5 96 Give you good-night.
5 97 
5 98 Mar.
5 99 O, farewell, honest soldier;
5 100 Who hath reliev'd you?
5 101 
5 102 Fran.
5 103 Bernardo has my place.
5 104 Give you good-night.
5 105 
5 106 [Exit.]
5 107 
5 108 Mar.
5 109 Holla! Bernardo!
5 110 
5 111 Ber.
5 112 Say.
5 113 What, is Horatio there?
5 114 
5 115 Hor.
5 116 A piece of him.
5 117 
5 118 Ber.
5 119 Welcome, Horatio:--Welcome, good Marcellus.
5 120 
5 121 Mar.
5 122 What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
5 123 
5 124 Ber.
5 125 I have seen nothing.
5 126 
5 127 Mar.
5 128 Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
5 129 And will not let belief take hold of him
5 130 Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
5 131 Therefore I have entreated him along
5 132 With us to watch the minutes of this night;
5 133 That, if again this apparition come
5 134 He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
5 135 
5 136 Hor.
5 137 Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
5 138 
5 139 Ber.
5 140 Sit down awhile,
5 141 And let us once again assail your ears,
5 142 That are so fortified against our story,
5 143 What we two nights have seen.
5 144 
5 145 Hor.
5 146 Well, sit we down,
5 147 And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
5 148 
5 149 Ber.
5 150 Last night of all,
5 151 When yond same star that's westward from the pole
5 152 Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
5 153 Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
5 154 The bell then beating one,--
5 155 
5 156 Mar.
5 157 Peace, break thee off; look where it comes again!
5 158 
5 159 [Enter Ghost, armed.]
5 160 
5 161 Ber.
5 162 In the same figure, like the king that's dead.
5 163 
5 164 Mar.
5 165 Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
5 166 
5 167 Ber.
5 168 Looks it not like the King? mark it, Horatio.
5 169 
5 170 Hor.
5 171 Most like:--it harrows me with fear and wonder.
5 172 
5 173 Ber.
5 174 It would be spoke to.
5 175 
5 176 Mar.
5 177 Question it, Horatio.
5 178 
5 179 Hor.
5 180 What art thou, that usurp'st this time of night,
5 181 Together with that fair and warlike form
5 182 In which the majesty of buried Denmark
5 183 Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee, speak!
5 184 
5 185 Mar.
5 186 It is offended.
5 187 
5 188 Ber.
5 189 See, it stalks away!
5 190 
5 191 Hor.
5 192 Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee speak!
5 193 
5 194 [Exit Ghost.]
5 195 
5 196 Mar.
5 197 'Tis gone, and will not answer.
5 198 
5 199 Ber.
5 200 How now, Horatio! You tremble and look pale:
5 201 Is not this something more than fantasy?
5 202 What think you on't?
5 203 
5 204 Hor.
5 205 Before my God, I might not this believe
5 206 Without the sensible and true avouch
5 207 Of mine own eyes.
5 208 
5 209 Mar.
5 210 Is it not like the King?
5 211 
5 212 Hor.
5 213 As thou art to thyself:
5 214 Such was the very armour he had on
5 215 When he the ambitious Norway combated;
5 216 So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
5 217 He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
5 218 'Tis strange.
5 219 
5 220 Mar.
5 221 Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
5 222 With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
5 223 
5 224 Hor.
5 225 In what particular thought to work I know not;
5 226 But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,
5 227 This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
5 228 
5 229 Mar.
5 230 Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
5 231 Why this same strict and most observant watch
5 232 So nightly toils the subject of the land;
5 233 And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
5 234 And foreign mart for implements of war;
5 235 Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
5 236 Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
5 237 What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
5 238 Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
5 239 Who is't that can inform me?
5 240 
5 241 Hor.
5 242 That can I;
5 243 At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
5 244 Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
5 245 Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
5 246 Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
5 247 Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet,--
5 248 For so this side of our known world esteem'd him,--
5 249 Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
5 250 Well ratified by law and heraldry,
5 251 Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands,
5 252 Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror:
5 253 Against the which, a moiety competent
5 254 Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
5 255 To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
5 256 Had he been vanquisher; as by the same cov'nant,
5 257 And carriage of the article design'd,
5 258 His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
5 259 Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
5 260 Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,
5 261 Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
5 262 For food and diet, to some enterprise
5 263 That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,--
5 264 As it doth well appear unto our state,--
5 265 But to recover of us, by strong hand,
5 266 And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
5 267 So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
5 268 Is the main motive of our preparations,
5 269 The source of this our watch, and the chief head
5 270 Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
5 271 
5 272 Ber.
5 273 I think it be no other but e'en so:
5 274 Well may it sort, that this portentous figure
5 275 Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
5 276 That was and is the question of these wars.
5 277 
5 278 Hor.
5 279 A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
5 280 In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
5 281 A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
5 282 The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
5 283 Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;
5 284 As, stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
5 285 Disasters in the sun; and the moist star,
5 286 Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands,
5 287 Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
5 288 And even the like precurse of fierce events,--
5 289 As harbingers preceding still the fates,
5 290 And prologue to the omen coming on,--
5 291 Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
5 292 Unto our climature and countrymen.--
5 293 But, soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
5 294 
5 295 [Re-enter Ghost.]
5 296 
5 297 I'll cross it, though it blast me.--Stay, illusion!
5 298 If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
5 299 Speak to me:
5 300 If there be any good thing to be done,
5 301 That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,
5 302 Speak to me:
5 303 If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
5 304 Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid,
5 305 O, speak!
5 306 Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
5 307 Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
5 308 For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
5 309 [The cock crows.]
5 310 Speak of it:--stay, and speak!--Stop it, Marcellus!
5 311 
5 312 Mar.
5 313 Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
5 314 
5 315 Hor.
5 316 Do, if it will not stand.
5 317 
5 318 Ber.
5 319 'Tis here!
5 320 
5 321 Hor.
5 322 'Tis here!
5 323 
5 324 Mar.
5 325 'Tis gone!
5 326 
5 327 [Exit Ghost.]
5 328 
5 329 We do it wrong, being so majestical,
5 330 To offer it the show of violence;
5 331 For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
5 332 And our vain blows malicious mockery.
5 333 
5 334 Ber.
5 335 It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
5 336 
5 337 Hor.
5 338 And then it started, like a guilty thing
5 339 Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
5 340 The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
5 341 Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
5 342 Awake the god of day; and at his warning,
5 343 Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
5 344 The extravagant and erring spirit hies
5 345 To his confine: and of the truth herein
5 346 This present object made probation.
5 347 
5 348 Mar.
5 349 It faded on the crowing of the cock.
5 350 Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
5 351 Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
5 352 The bird of dawning singeth all night long;
5 353 And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad;
5 354 The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
5 355 No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm;
5 356 So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
5 357 
5 358 Hor.
5 359 So have I heard, and do in part believe it.
5 360 But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
5 361 Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
5 362 Break we our watch up: and by my advice,
5 363 Let us impart what we have seen to-night
5 364 Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
5 365 This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him:
5 366 Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
5 367 As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
5 368 
5 369 Mar.
5 370 Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
5 371 Where we shall find him most conveniently.
5 372 
5 373 [Exeunt.]
5 374 
5 375 
5 376 
5 377 Scene II. Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle.
5 378 
5 379 [Enter the King, Queen, Hamlet, Polonius, Laertes, Voltimand,
5 380 Cornelius, Lords, and Attendant.]
5 381 
5 382 King.
5 383 Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
5 384 The memory be green, and that it us befitted
5 385 To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
5 386 To be contracted in one brow of woe;
5 387 Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
5 388 That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
5 389 Together with remembrance of ourselves.
5 390 Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
5 391 Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,
5 392 Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--
5 393 With an auspicious and one dropping eye,
5 394 With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
5 395 In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--
5 396 Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd
5 397 Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
5 398 With this affair along:--or all, our thanks.
5 399 Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
5 400 Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
5 401 Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
5 402 Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
5 403 Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,
5 404 He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
5 405 Importing the surrender of those lands
5 406 Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
5 407 To our most valiant brother. So much for him,--
5 408 Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
5 409 Thus much the business is:--we have here writ
5 410 To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--
5 411 Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
5 412 Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress
5 413 His further gait herein; in that the levies,
5 414 The lists, and full proportions are all made
5 415 Out of his subject:--and we here dispatch
5 416 You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
5 417 For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;
5 418 Giving to you no further personal power
5 419 To business with the king, more than the scope
5 420 Of these dilated articles allow.
5 421 Farewell; and let your haste commend your duty.
5 422 
5 423 Cor. and Volt.
5 424 In that and all things will we show our duty.
5 425 
5 426 King.
5 427 We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.
5 428 
5 429 [Exeunt Voltimand and Cornelius.]
5 430 
5 431 And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
5 432 You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?
5 433 You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
5 434 And lose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
5 435 That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
5 436 The head is not more native to the heart,
5 437 The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
5 438 Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
5 439 What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
5 440 
5 441 Laer.
5 442 Dread my lord,
5 443 Your leave and favour to return to France;
5 444 From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,
5 445 To show my duty in your coronation;
5 446 Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
5 447 My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France,
5 448 And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
5 449 
5 450 King.
5 451 Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
5 452 
5 453 Pol.
5 454 He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
5 455 By laboursome petition; and at last
5 456 Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
5 457 I do beseech you, give him leave to go.
5 458 
5 459 King.
5 460 Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
5 461 And thy best graces spend it at thy will!--
5 462 But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son--
5 463 
5 464 Ham.
5 465 [Aside.] A little more than kin, and less than kind!
5 466 
5 467 King.
5 468 How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
5 469 
5 470 Ham.
5 471 Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.
5 472 
5 473 Queen.
5 474 Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
5 475 And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
5 476 Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
5 477 Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
5 478 Thou know'st 'tis common,--all that lives must die,
5 479 Passing through nature to eternity.
5 480 
5 481 Ham.
5 482 Ay, madam, it is common.
5 483 
5 484 Queen.
5 485 If it be,
5 486 Why seems it so particular with thee?
5 487 
5 488 Ham.
5 489 Seems, madam! Nay, it is; I know not seems.
5 490 'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
5 491 Nor customary suits of solemn black,
5 492 Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
5 493 No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
5 494 Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
5 495 Together with all forms, moods, shows of grief,
5 496 That can denote me truly: these, indeed, seem;
5 497 For they are actions that a man might play;
5 498 But I have that within which passeth show;
5 499 These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
5 500 
5 501 King.
5 502 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
5 503 To give these mourning duties to your father;
5 504 But, you must know, your father lost a father;
5 505 That father lost, lost his; and the survivor bound,
5 506 In filial obligation, for some term
5 507 To do obsequious sorrow: but to persevere
5 508 In obstinate condolement is a course
5 509 Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
5 510 It shows a will most incorrect to heaven;
5 511 A heart unfortified, a mind impatient;
5 512 An understanding simple and unschool'd;
5 513 For what we know must be, and is as common
5 514 As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
5 515 Why should we, in our peevish opposition,
5 516 Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
5 517 A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
5 518 To reason most absurd; whose common theme
5 519 Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
5 520 From the first corse till he that died to-day,
5 521 'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth
5 522 This unprevailing woe; and think of us
5 523 As of a father: for let the world take note
5 524 You are the most immediate to our throne;
5 525 And with no less nobility of love
5 526 Than that which dearest father bears his son
5 527 Do I impart toward you. For your intent
5 528 In going back to school in Wittenberg,
5 529 It is most retrograde to our desire:
5 530 And we beseech you bend you to remain
5 531 Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
5 532 Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
5 533 
5 534 Queen.
5 535 Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:
5 536 I pray thee stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.
5 537 
5 538 Ham.
5 539 I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
5 540 
5 541 King.
5 542 Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:
5 543 Be as ourself in Denmark.--Madam, come;
5 544 This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet
5 545 Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,
5 546 No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day
5 547 But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell;
5 548 And the king's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,
5 549 Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.
5 550 
5 551 [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]
5 552 
5 553 Ham.
5 554 O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
5 555 Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
5 556 Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
5 557 His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! O God!
5 558 How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
5 559 Seem to me all the uses of this world!
5 560 Fie on't! O fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,
5 561 That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
5 562 Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
5 563 But two months dead!--nay, not so much, not two:
5 564 So excellent a king; that was, to this,
5 565 Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother,
5 566 That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
5 567 Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
5 568 Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him
5 569 As if increase of appetite had grown
5 570 By what it fed on: and yet, within a month,--
5 571 Let me not think on't,--Frailty, thy name is woman!--
5 572 A little month; or ere those shoes were old
5 573 With which she followed my poor father's body
5 574 Like Niobe, all tears;--why she, even she,--
5 575 O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason,
5 576 Would have mourn'd longer,--married with mine uncle,
5 577 My father's brother; but no more like my father
5 578 Than I to Hercules: within a month;
5 579 Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
5 580 Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
5 581 She married:-- O, most wicked speed, to post
5 582 With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
5 583 It is not, nor it cannot come to good;
5 584 But break my heart,--for I must hold my tongue!
5 585 
5 586 [Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.]
5 587 
5 588 Hor.
5 589 Hail to your lordship!
5 590 
5 591 Ham.
5 592 I am glad to see you well:
5 593 Horatio,--or I do forget myself.
5 594 
5 595 Hor.
5 596 The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
5 597 
5 598 Ham.
5 599 Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:
5 600 And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?--
5 601 Marcellus?
5 602 
5 603 Mar.
5 604 My good lord,--
5 605 
5 606 Ham.
5 607 I am very glad to see you.--Good even, sir.--
5 608 But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
5 609 
5 610 Hor.
5 611 A truant disposition, good my lord.
5 612 
5 613 Ham.
5 614 I would not hear your enemy say so;
5 615 Nor shall you do my ear that violence,
5 616 To make it truster of your own report
5 617 Against yourself: I know you are no truant.
5 618 But what is your affair in Elsinore?
5 619 We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
5 620 
5 621 Hor.
5 622 My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
5 623 
5 624 Ham.
5 625 I prithee do not mock me, fellow-student.
5 626 I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
5 627 
5 628 Hor.
5 629 Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.
5 630 
5 631 Ham.
5 632 Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats
5 633 Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
5 634 Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
5 635 Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!--
5 636 My father,--methinks I see my father.
5 637 
5 638 Hor.
5 639 Where, my lord?
5 640 
5 641 Ham.
5 642 In my mind's eye, Horatio.
5 643 
5 644 Hor.
5 645 I saw him once; he was a goodly king.
5 646 
5 647 Ham.
5 648 He was a man, take him for all in all,
5 649 I shall not look upon his like again.
5 650 
5 651 Hor.
5 652 My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
5 653 
5 654 Ham.
5 655 Saw who?
5 656 
5 657 Hor.
5 658 My lord, the king your father.
5 659 
5 660 Ham.
5 661 The King my father!
5 662 
5 663 Hor.
5 664 Season your admiration for awhile
5 665 With an attent ear, till I may deliver,
5 666 Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
5 667 This marvel to you.
5 668 
5 669 Ham.
5 670 For God's love let me hear.
5 671 
5 672 Hor.
5 673 Two nights together had these gentlemen,
5 674 Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch
5 675 In the dead vast and middle of the night,
5 676 Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,
5 677 Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
5 678 Appears before them and with solemn march
5 679 Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd
5 680 By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
5 681 Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distill'd
5 682 Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
5 683 Stand dumb, and speak not to him. This to me
5 684 In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
5 685 And I with them the third night kept the watch:
5 686 Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
5 687 Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
5 688 The apparition comes: I knew your father;
5 689 These hands are not more like.
5 690 
5 691 Ham.
5 692 But where was this?
5 693 
5 694 Mar.
5 695 My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
5 696 
5 697 Ham.
5 698 Did you not speak to it?
5 699 
5 700 Hor.
5 701 My lord, I did;
5 702 But answer made it none: yet once methought
5 703 It lifted up it head, and did address
5 704 Itself to motion, like as it would speak:
5 705 But even then the morning cock crew loud,
5 706 And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
5 707 And vanish'd from our sight.
5 708 
5 709 Ham.
5 710 'Tis very strange.
5 711 
5 712 Hor.
5 713 As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
5 714 And we did think it writ down in our duty
5 715 To let you know of it.
5 716 
5 717 Ham.
5 718 Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
5 719 Hold you the watch to-night?
5 720 
5 721 Mar. and Ber.
5 722 We do, my lord.
5 723 
5 724 Ham.
5 725 Arm'd, say you?
5 726 
5 727 Both.
5 728 Arm'd, my lord.
5 729 
5 730 Ham.
5 731 From top to toe?
5 732 
5 733 Both.
5 734 My lord, from head to foot.
5 735 
5 736 Ham.
5 737 Then saw you not his face?
5 738 
5 739 Hor.
5 740 O, yes, my lord: he wore his beaver up.
5 741 
5 742 Ham.
5 743 What, look'd he frowningly?
5 744 
5 745 Hor.
5 746 A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
5 747 
5 748 Ham.
5 749 Pale or red?
5 750 
5 751 Hor.
5 752 Nay, very pale.
5 753 
5 754 Ham.
5 755 And fix'd his eyes upon you?
5 756 
5 757 Hor.
5 758 Most constantly.
5 759 
5 760 Ham.
5 761 I would I had been there.
5 762 
5 763 Hor.
5 764 It would have much amaz'd you.
5 765 
5 766 Ham.
5 767 Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
5 768 
5 769 Hor.
5 770 While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
5 771 
5 772 Mar. and Ber.
5 773 Longer, longer.
5 774 
5 775 Hor.
5 776 Not when I saw't.
5 777 
5 778 Ham.
5 779 His beard was grizzled,--no?
5 780 
5 781 Hor.
5 782 It was, as I have seen it in his life,
5 783 A sable silver'd.
5 784 
5 785 Ham.
5 786 I will watch to-night;
5 787 Perchance 'twill walk again.
5 788 
5 789 Hor.
5 790 I warr'nt it will.
5 791 
5 792 Ham.
5 793 If it assume my noble father's person,
5 794 I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
5 795 And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
5 796 If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
5 797 Let it be tenable in your silence still;
5 798 And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
5 799 Give it an understanding, but no tongue:
5 800 I will requite your loves. So, fare ye well:
5 801 Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
5 802 I'll visit you.
5 803 
5 804 All.
5 805 Our duty to your honour.
5 806 
5 807 Ham.
5 808 Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.
5 809 
5 810 [Exeunt Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.]
5 811 
5 812 My father's spirit in arms! All is not well;
5 813 I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!
5 814 Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,
5 815 Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
5 816 
5 817 [Exit.]

5 821 Scene III. A room in Polonius's house.
5 822 
5 823 [Enter Laertes and Ophelia.]
5 824 
5 825 Laer.
5 826 My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:
5 827 And, sister, as the winds give benefit
5 828 And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
5 829 But let me hear from you.
5 830 
5 831 Oph.
5 832 Do you doubt that?
5 833 
5 834 Laer.
5 835 For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,
5 836 Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood:
5 837 A violet in the youth of primy nature,
5 838 Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting;
5 839 The perfume and suppliance of a minute;
5 840 No more.
5 841 
5 842 Oph.
5 843 No more but so?
5 844 
5 845 Laer.
5 846 Think it no more:
5 847 For nature, crescent, does not grow alone
5 848 In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,
5 849 The inward service of the mind and soul
5 850 Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now;
5 851 And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
5 852 The virtue of his will: but you must fear,
5 853 His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
5 854 For he himself is subject to his birth:
5 855 He may not, as unvalu'd persons do,
5 856 Carve for himself; for on his choice depends
5 857 The safety and health of this whole state;
5 858 And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
5 859 Unto the voice and yielding of that body
5 860 Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
5 861 It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
5 862 As he in his particular act and place
5 863 May give his saying deed; which is no further
5 864 Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
5 865 Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
5 866 If with too credent ear you list his songs,
5 867 Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
5 868 To his unmaster'd importunity.
5 869 Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister;
5 870 And keep you in the rear of your affection,
5 871 Out of the shot and danger of desire.
5 872 The chariest maid is prodigal enough
5 873 If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
5 874 Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes:
5 875 The canker galls the infants of the spring
5 876 Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd:
5 877 And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
5 878 Contagious blastments are most imminent.
5 879 Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
5 880 Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
5 881 
5 882 Oph.
5 883 I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep
5 884 As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
5 885 Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
5 886 Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;
5 887 Whilst, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
5 888 Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads
5 889 And recks not his own read.
5 890 
5 891 Laer.
5 892 O, fear me not.
5 893 I stay too long:--but here my father comes.
5 894 
5 895 [Enter Polonius.]
5 896 
5 897 A double blessing is a double grace;
5 898 Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
5 899 
5 900 Pol.
5 901 Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!
5 902 The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
5 903 And you are stay'd for. There,--my blessing with thee!
5 904 
5 905 [Laying his hand on Laertes's head.]
5 906 
5 907 And these few precepts in thy memory
5 908 Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
5 909 Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
5 910 Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
5 911 Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
5 912 Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;
5 913 But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
5 914 Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware
5 915 Of entrance to a quarrel; but, being in,
5 916 Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.
5 917 Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice:
5 918 Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
5 919 Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
5 920 But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy:
5 921 For the apparel oft proclaims the man;
5 922 And they in France of the best rank and station
5 923 Are most select and generous chief in that.
5 924 Neither a borrower nor a lender be:
5 925 For loan oft loses both itself and friend;
5 926 And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
5 927 This above all,--to thine own self be true;
5 928 And it must follow, as the night the day,
5 929 Thou canst not then be false to any man.
5 930 Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!
5 931 
5 932 Laer.
5 933 Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
5 934 
5 935 Pol.
5 936 The time invites you; go, your servants tend.
5 937 
5 938 Laer.
5 939 Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well
5 940 What I have said to you.
5 941 
5 942 Oph.
5 943 'Tis in my memory lock'd,
5 944 And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
5 945 
5 946 Laer.
5 947 Farewell.
5 948 
5 949 [Exit.]
5 950 
5 951 Pol.
5 952 What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
5 953 
5 954 Oph.
5 955 So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
5 956 
5 957 Pol.
5 958 Marry, well bethought:
5 959 'Tis told me he hath very oft of late
5 960 Given private time to you; and you yourself
5 961 Have of your audience been most free and bounteous;
5 962 If it be so,--as so 'tis put on me,
5 963 And that in way of caution,--I must tell you
5 964 You do not understand yourself so clearly
5 965 As it behooves my daughter and your honour.
5 966 What is between you? give me up the truth.
5 967 
5 968 Oph.
5 969 He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
5 970 Of his affection to me.
5 971 
5 972 Pol.
5 973 Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,
5 974 Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
5 975 Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
5 976 
5 977 Oph.
5 978 I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
5 979 
5 980 Pol.
5 981 Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;
5 982 That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
5 983 Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;
5 984 Or,--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
5 985 Wronging it thus,--you'll tender me a fool.
5 986 
5 987 Oph.
5 988 My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
5 989 In honourable fashion.
5 990 
5 991 Pol.
5 992 Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.
5 993 
5 994 Oph.
5 995 And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
5 996 With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
5 997 
5 998 Pol.
5 999 Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,
5 1000 When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
5 1001 Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,
5 1002 Giving more light than heat,--extinct in both,
5 1003 Even in their promise, as it is a-making,--
5 1004 You must not take for fire. From this time
5 1005 Be something scanter of your maiden presence;
5 1006 Set your entreatments at a higher rate
5 1007 Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
5 1008 Believe so much in him, that he is young;
5 1009 And with a larger tether may he walk
5 1010 Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,
5 1011 Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,--
5 1012 Not of that dye which their investments show,
5 1013 But mere implorators of unholy suits,
5 1014 Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
5 1015 The better to beguile. This is for all,--
5 1016 I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth
5 1017 Have you so slander any moment leisure
5 1018 As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
5 1019 Look to't, I charge you; come your ways.
5 1020 
5 1021 Oph.
5 1022 I shall obey, my lord.
5 1023 
5 1024 [Exeunt.]

5 1027 
5 1028 Scene IV. The platform.
5 1029 
5 1030 [Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus.]
5 1031 
5 1032 Ham.
5 1033 The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
5 1034 
5 1035 Hor.
5 1036 It is a nipping and an eager air.
5 1037 
5 1038 Ham.
5 1039 What hour now?
5 1040 
5 1041 Hor.
5 1042 I think it lacks of twelve.
5 1043 
5 1044 Mar.
5 1045 No, it is struck.
5 1046 
5 1047 Hor.
5 1048 Indeed? I heard it not: then draws near the season
5 1049 Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
5 1050 
5 1051 [A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off within.]
5 1052 
5 1053 What does this mean, my lord?
5 1054 
5 1055 Ham.
5 1056 The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
5 1057 Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;
5 1058 And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
5 1059 The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out
5 1060 The triumph of his pledge.
5 1061 
5 1062 Hor.
5 1063 Is it a custom?
5 1064 
5 1065 Ham.
5 1066 Ay, marry, is't;
5 1067 But to my mind,--though I am native here,
5 1068 And to the manner born,--it is a custom
5 1069 More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
5 1070 This heavy-headed revel east and west
5 1071 Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations:
5 1072 They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase
5 1073 Soil our addition; and, indeed, it takes
5 1074 From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
5 1075 The pith and marrow of our attribute.
5 1076 So oft it chances in particular men
5 1077 That, for some vicious mole of nature in them,
5 1078 As in their birth,--wherein they are not guilty,
5 1079 Since nature cannot choose his origin,--
5 1080 By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
5 1081 Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason;
5 1082 Or by some habit, that too much o'er-leavens
5 1083 The form of plausive manners;--that these men,--
5 1084 Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
5 1085 Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,--
5 1086 Their virtues else,--be they as pure as grace,
5 1087 As infinite as man may undergo,--
5 1088 Shall in the general censure take corruption
5 1089 From that particular fault: the dram of eale
5 1090 Doth all the noble substance often doubt
5 1091 To his own scandal.
5 1092 
5 1093 Hor.
5 1094 Look, my lord, it comes!
5 1095 
5 1096 [Enter Ghost.]
5 1097 
5 1098 Ham.
5 1099 Angels and ministers of grace defend us!--
5 1100 Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
5 1101 Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
5 1102 Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
5 1103 Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
5 1104 That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,
5 1105 King, father, royal Dane; O, answer me!
5 1106 Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell
5 1107 Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
5 1108 Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,
5 1109 Wherein we saw thee quietly in-urn'd,
5 1110 Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
5 1111 To cast thee up again! What may this mean,
5 1112 That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,
5 1113 Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,
5 1114 Making night hideous, and we fools of nature
5 1115 So horridly to shake our disposition
5 1116 With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
5 1117 Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?
5 1118 
5 1119 [Ghost beckons Hamlet.]
5 1120 
5 1121 Hor.
5 1122 It beckons you to go away with it,
5 1123 As if it some impartment did desire
5 1124 To you alone.
5 1125 
5 1126 Mar.
5 1127 Look with what courteous action
5 1128 It waves you to a more removed ground:
5 1129 But do not go with it!
5 1130 
5 1131 Hor.
5 1132 No, by no means.
5 1133 
5 1134 Ham.
5 1135 It will not speak; then will I follow it.
5 1136 
5 1137 Hor.
5 1138 Do not, my lord.
5 1139 
5 1140 Ham.
5 1141 Why, what should be the fear?
5 1142 I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
5 1143 And for my soul, what can it do to that,
5 1144 Being a thing immortal as itself?
5 1145 It waves me forth again;--I'll follow it.
5 1146 
5 1147 Hor.
5 1148 What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
5 1149 Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
5 1150 That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
5 1151 And there assume some other horrible form
5 1152 Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason,
5 1153 And draw you into madness? think of it:
5 1154 The very place puts toys of desperation,
5 1155 Without more motive, into every brain
5 1156 That looks so many fadoms to the sea
5 1157 And hears it roar beneath.
5 1158 
5 1159 Ham.
5 1160 It waves me still.--
5 1161 Go on; I'll follow thee.
5 1162 
5 1163 Mar.
5 1164 You shall not go, my lord.
5 1165 
5 1166 Ham.
5 1167 Hold off your hands.
5 1168 
5 1169 Hor.
5 1170 Be rul'd; you shall not go.
5 1171 
5 1172 Ham.
5 1173 My fate cries out,
5 1174 And makes each petty artery in this body
5 1175 As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.--
5 1176 
5 1177 [Ghost beckons.]
5 1178 
5 1179 Still am I call'd;--unhand me, gentlemen;--
5 1180 
5 1181 [Breaking free from them.]
5 1182 
5 1183 By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!--
5 1184 I say, away!--Go on; I'll follow thee.
5 1185 
5 1186 [Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.]
5 1187 
5 1188 Hor.
5 1189 He waxes desperate with imagination.
5 1190 
5 1191 Mar.
5 1192 Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.
5 1193 
5 1194 Hor.
5 1195 Have after.--To what issue will this come?
5 1196 
5 1197 Mar.
5 1198 Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
5 1199 
5 1200 Hor.
5 1201 Heaven will direct it.
5 1202 
5 1203 Mar.
5 1204 Nay, let's follow him.
5 1205 
5 1206 [Exeunt.]
5 1207 
5 1208 
5 1209 
5 1210 Scene V. A more remote part of the Castle.
5 1211 
5 1212 [Enter Ghost and Hamlet.]
5 1213 
5 1214 Ham.
5 1215 Whither wilt thou lead me? speak! I'll go no further.
5 1216 
5 1217 Ghost.
5 1218 Mark me.
5 1219 
5 1220 Ham.
5 1221 I will.
5 1222 
5 1223 Ghost.
5 1224 My hour is almost come,
5 1225 When I to sulph'uous and tormenting flames
5 1226 Must render up myself.
5 1227 
5 1228 Ham.
5 1229 Alas, poor ghost!
5 1230 
5 1231 Ghost.
5 1232 Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
5 1233 To what I shall unfold.
5 1234 
5 1235 Ham.
5 1236 Speak; I am bound to hear.
5 1237 
5 1238 Ghost.
5 1239 So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
5 1240 
5 1241 Ham.
5 1242 What?
5 1243 
5 1244 Ghost.
5 1245 I am thy father's spirit;
5 1246 Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
5 1247 And for the day confin'd to wastein fires,
5 1248 Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
5 1249 Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid
5 1250 To tell the secrets of my prison-house,
5 1251 I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
5 1252 Would harrow up thy soul; freeze thy young blood;
5 1253 Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres;
5 1254 Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
5 1255 And each particular hair to stand on end
5 1256 Like quills upon the fretful porcupine:
5 1257 But this eternal blazon must not be
5 1258 To ears of flesh and blood.--List, list, O, list!--
5 1259 If thou didst ever thy dear father love--
5 1260 
5 1261 Ham.
5 1262 O God!
5 1263 
5 1264 Ghost.
5 1265 Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
5 1266 
5 1267 Ham.
5 1268 Murder!
5 1269 
5 1270 Ghost.
5 1271 Murder most foul, as in the best it is;
5 1272 But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
5 1273 
5 1274 Ham.
5 1275 Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
5 1276 As meditation or the thoughts of love,
5 1277 May sweep to my revenge.
5 1278 
5 1279 Ghost.
5 1280 I find thee apt;
5 1281 And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
5 1282 That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
5 1283 Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.
5 1284 'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
5 1285 A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark
5 1286 Is by a forged process of my death
5 1287 Rankly abus'd; but know, thou noble youth,
5 1288 The serpent that did sting thy father's life
5 1289 Now wears his crown.
5 1290 
5 1291 Ham.
5 1292 O my prophetic soul!
5 1293 Mine uncle!
5 1294 
5 1295 Ghost.
5 1296 Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
5 1297 With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,--
5 1298 O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
5 1299 So to seduce!--won to his shameful lust
5 1300 The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:
5 1301 O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!
5 1302 From me, whose love was of that dignity
5 1303 That it went hand in hand even with the vow
5 1304 I made to her in marriage; and to decline
5 1305 Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
5 1306 To those of mine!
5 1307 But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,
5 1308 Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven;
5 1309 So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
5 1310 Will sate itself in a celestial bed
5 1311 And prey on garbage.
5 1312 But soft! methinks I scent the morning air;
5 1313 Brief let me be.--Sleeping within my orchard,
5 1314 My custom always of the afternoon,
5 1315 Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
5 1316 With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,
5 1317 And in the porches of my ears did pour
5 1318 The leperous distilment; whose effect
5 1319 Holds such an enmity with blood of man
5 1320 That, swift as quicksilver, it courses through
5 1321 The natural gates and alleys of the body;
5 1322 And with a sudden vigour it doth posset
5 1323 And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
5 1324 The thin and wholesome blood; so did it mine;
5 1325 And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
5 1326 Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
5 1327 All my smooth body.
5 1328 Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand,
5 1329 Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:
5 1330 Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
5 1331 Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd;
5 1332 No reckoning made, but sent to my account
5 1333 With all my imperfections on my head:
5 1334 O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
5 1335 If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;
5 1336 Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
5 1337 A couch for luxury and damned incest.
5 1338 But, howsoever thou pursu'st this act,
5 1339 Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
5 1340 Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven,
5 1341 And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,
5 1342 To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!
5 1343 The glowworm shows the matin to be near,
5 1344 And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:
5 1345 Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.
5 1346 
5 1347 [Exit.]
5 1348 
5 1349 Ham.
5 1350 O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?
5 1351 And shall I couple hell? O, fie!--Hold, my heart;
5 1352 And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
5 1353 But bear me stiffly up.--Remember thee!
5 1354 Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
5 1355 In this distracted globe. Remember thee!
5 1356 Yea, from the table of my memory
5 1357 I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
5 1358 All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,
5 1359 That youth and observation copied there;
5 1360 And thy commandment all alone shall live
5 1361 Within the book and volume of my brain,
5 1362 Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven!--
5 1363 O most pernicious woman!
5 1364 O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
5 1365 My tables,--meet it is I set it down,
5 1366 That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
5 1367 At least, I am sure, it may be so in Denmark:
5 1368 
5 1369 [Writing.]
5 1370 
5 1371 So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;
5 1372 It is 'Adieu, adieu! remember me:'
5 1373 I have sworn't.
5 1374 
5 1375 Hor.
5 1376 [Within.] My lord, my lord,--
5 1377 
5 1378 Mar.
5 1379 [Within.] Lord Hamlet,--
5 1380 
5 1381 Hor.
5 1382 [Within.] Heaven secure him!
5 1383 
5 1384 Ham.
5 1385 So be it!
5 1386 
5 1387 Mar.
5 1388 [Within.] Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
5 1389 
5 1390 Ham.
5 1391 Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
5 1392 
5 1393 [Enter Horatio and Marcellus.]
5 1394 
5 1395 Mar.
5 1396 How is't, my noble lord?
5 1397 
5 1398 Hor.
5 1399 What news, my lord?
5 1400 
5 1401 Ham.
5 1402 O, wonderful!
5 1403 
5 1404 Hor.
5 1405 Good my lord, tell it.
5 1406 
5 1407 Ham.
5 1408 No; you'll reveal it.
5 1409 
5 1410 Hor.
5 1411 Not I, my lord, by heaven.
5 1412 
5 1413 Mar.
5 1414 Nor I, my lord.
5 1415 
5 1416 Ham.
5 1417 How say you then; would heart of man once think it?--
5 1418 But you'll be secret?
5 1419 
5 1420 Hor. and Mar.
5 1421 Ay, by heaven, my lord.
5 1422 
5 1423 Ham.
5 1424 There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark
5 1425 But he's an arrant knave.
5 1426 
5 1427 Hor.
5 1428 There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
5 1429 To tell us this.
5 1430 
5 1431 Ham.
5 1432 Why, right; you are i' the right;
5 1433 And so, without more circumstance at all,
5 1434 I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:
5 1435 You, as your business and desires shall point you,--
5 1436 For every man hath business and desire,
5 1437 Such as it is;--and for my own poor part,
5 1438 Look you, I'll go pray.
5 1439 
5 1440 Hor.
5 1441 These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
5 1442 
5 1443 Ham.
5 1444 I'm sorry they offend you, heartily;
5 1445 Yes, faith, heartily.
5 1446 
5 1447 Hor.
5 1448 There's no offence, my lord.
5 1449 
5 1450 Ham.
5 1451 Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
5 1452 And much offence too. Touching this vision here,--
5 1453 It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you:
5 1454 For your desire to know what is between us,
5 1455 O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,
5 1456 As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,
5 1457 Give me one poor request.
5 1458 
5 1459 Hor.
5 1460 What is't, my lord? we will.
5 1461 
5 1462 Ham.
5 1463 Never make known what you have seen to-night.
5 1464 
5 1465 Hor. and Mar.
5 1466 My lord, we will not.
5 1467 
5 1468 Ham.
5 1469 Nay, but swear't.
5 1470 
5 1471 Hor.
5 1472 In faith,
5 1473 My lord, not I.
5 1474 
5 1475 Mar.
5 1476 Nor I, my lord, in faith.
5 1477 
5 1478 Ham.
5 1479 Upon my sword.
5 1480 
5 1481 Mar.
5 1482 We have sworn, my lord, already.
5 1483 
5 1484 Ham.
5 1485 Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
5 1486 
5 1487 Ghost.
5 1488 [Beneath.] Swear.
5 1489 
5 1490 Ham.
5 1491 Ha, ha boy! say'st thou so? art thou there, truepenny?--
5 1492 Come on!--you hear this fellow in the cellarage,--
5 1493 Consent to swear.
5 1494 
5 1495 Hor.
5 1496 Propose the oath, my lord.
5 1497 
5 1498 Ham.
5 1499 Never to speak of this that you have seen,
5 1500 Swear by my sword.
5 1501 
5 1502 Ghost.
5 1503 [Beneath.] Swear.
5 1504 
5 1505 Ham.
5 1506 Hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground.--
5 1507 Come hither, gentlemen,
5 1508 And lay your hands again upon my sword:
5 1509 Never to speak of this that you have heard,
5 1510 Swear by my sword.
5 1511 
5 1512 Ghost.
5 1513 [Beneath.] Swear.
5 1514 
5 1515 Ham.
5 1516 Well said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast?
5 1517 A worthy pioner!--Once more remove, good friends.
5 1518 
5 1519 Hor.
5 1520 O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
5 1521 
5 1522 Ham.
5 1523 And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
5 1524 There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
5 1525 Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
5 1526 But come;--
5 1527 Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
5 1528 How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,--
5 1529 As I, perchance, hereafter shall think meet
5 1530 To put an antic disposition on,--
5 1531 That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
5 1532 With arms encumber'd thus, or this head-shake,
5 1533 Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
5 1534 As 'Well, well, we know'; or 'We could, an if we would';--
5 1535 Or 'If we list to speak'; or 'There be, an if they might';--
5 1536 Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
5 1537 That you know aught of me:--this is not to do,
5 1538 So grace and mercy at your most need help you,
5 1539 Swear.
5 1540 
5 1541 Ghost.
5 1542 [Beneath.] Swear.
5 1543 
5 1544 Ham.
5 1545 Rest, rest, perturbed spirit!--So, gentlemen,
5 1546 With all my love I do commend me to you:
5 1547 And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
5 1548 May do, to express his love and friending to you,
5 1549 God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
5 1550 And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
5 1551 The time is out of joint:--O cursed spite,
5 1552 That ever I was born to set it right!--
5 1553 Nay, come, let's go together.
5 1554 
5 1555 [Exeunt.]
5 1556 
5 1557 
5 1558 
5 1559 Act II.
5 1560 
5 1561 Scene I. A room in Polonius's house.
5 1562 
5 1563 [Enter Polonius and Reynaldo.]
5 1564 
5 1565 Pol.
5 1566 Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
5 1567 
5 1568 Rey.
5 1569 I will, my lord.
5 1570 
5 1571 Pol.
5 1572 You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,
5 1573 Before You visit him, to make inquiry
5 1574 Of his behaviour.
5 1575 
5 1576 Rey.
5 1577 My lord, I did intend it.
5 1578 
5 1579 Pol.
5 1580 Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,
5 1581 Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
5 1582 And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
5 1583 What company, at what expense; and finding,
5 1584 By this encompassment and drift of question,
5 1585 That they do know my son, come you more nearer
5 1586 Than your particular demands will touch it:
5 1587 Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
5 1588 As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
5 1589 And in part him;--do you mark this, Reynaldo?
5 1590 
5 1591 Rey.
5 1592 Ay, very well, my lord.
5 1593 
5 1594 Pol.
5 1595 'And in part him;--but,' you may say, 'not well:
5 1596 But if't be he I mean, he's very wild;
5 1597 Addicted so and so;' and there put on him
5 1598 What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
5 1599 As may dishonour him; take heed of that;
5 1600 But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips
5 1601 As are companions noted and most known
5 1602 To youth and liberty.
5 1603 
5 1604 Rey.
5 1605 As gaming, my lord.
5 1606 
5 1607 Pol.
5 1608 Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
5 1609 Drabbing:--you may go so far.
5 1610 
5 1611 Rey.
5 1612 My lord, that would dishonour him.
5 1613 
5 1614 Pol.
5 1615 Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge.
5 1616 You must not put another scandal on him,
5 1617 That he is open to incontinency;
5 1618 That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly
5 1619 That they may seem the taints of liberty;
5 1620 The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind;
5 1621 A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
5 1622 Of general assault.
5 1623 
5 1624 Rey.
5 1625 But, my good lord,--
5 1626 
5 1627 Pol.
5 1628 Wherefore should you do this?
5 1629 
5 1630 Rey.
5 1631 Ay, my lord,
5 1632 I would know that.
5 1633 
5 1634 Pol.
5 1635 Marry, sir, here's my drift;
5 1636 And I believe it is a fetch of warrant:
5 1637 You laying these slight sullies on my son
5 1638 As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working,
5 1639 Mark you,
5 1640 Your party in converse, him you would sound,
5 1641 Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
5 1642 The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd
5 1643 He closes with you in this consequence;
5 1644 'Good sir,' or so; or 'friend,' or 'gentleman'--
5 1645 According to the phrase or the addition
5 1646 Of man and country.
5 1647 
5 1648 Rey.
5 1649 Very good, my lord.
5 1650 
5 1651 Pol.
5 1652 And then, sir, does he this,--he does--What was I about to say?--
5 1653 By the mass, I was about to say something:--Where did I leave?
5 1654 
5 1655 Rey.
5 1656 At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and
5 1657 gentleman.'
5 1658 
5 1659 Pol.
5 1660 At--closes in the consequence'--ay, marry!
5 1661 He closes with you thus:--'I know the gentleman;
5 1662 I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
5 1663 Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,
5 1664 There was he gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
5 1665 There falling out at tennis': or perchance,
5 1666 'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'--
5 1667 Videlicet, a brothel,--or so forth.--
5 1668 See you now;
5 1669 Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:
5 1670 And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
5 1671 With windlaces, and with assays of bias,
5 1672 By indirections find directions out:
5 1673 So, by my former lecture and advice,
5 1674 Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?
5 1675 
5 1676 Rey.
5 1677 My lord, I have.
5 1678 
5 1679 Pol.
5 1680 God b' wi' you, fare you well.
5 1681 
5 1682 Rey.
5 1683 Good my lord!
5 1684 
5 1685 Pol.
5 1686 Observe his inclination in yourself.
5 1687 
5 1688 Rey.
5 1689 I shall, my lord.
5 1690 
5 1691 Pol.
5 1692 And let him ply his music.
5 1693 
5 1694 Rey.
5 1695 Well, my lord.
5 1696 
5 1697 Pol.
5 1698 Farewell!
5 1699 
5 1700 [Exit Reynaldo.]
5 1701 
5 1702 [Enter Ophelia.]
5 1703 
5 1704 How now, Ophelia! what's the matter?
5 1705 
5 1706 Oph.
5 1707 Alas, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
5 1708 
5 1709 Pol.
5 1710 With what, i' the name of God?
5 1711 
5 1712 Oph.
5 1713 My lord, as I was sewing in my chamber,
5 1714 Lord Hamlet,--with his doublet all unbrac'd;
5 1715 No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,
5 1716 Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;
5 1717 Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;
5 1718 And with a look so piteous in purport
5 1719 As if he had been loosed out of hell
5 1720 To speak of horrors,--he comes before me.
5 1721 
5 1722 Pol.
5 1723 Mad for thy love?
5 1724 
5 1725 Oph.
5 1726 My lord, I do not know;
5 1727 But truly I do fear it.
5 1728 
5 1729 Pol.
5 1730 What said he?
5 1731 
5 1732 Oph.
5 1733 He took me by the wrist, and held me hard;
5 1734 Then goes he to the length of all his arm;
5 1735 And with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
5 1736 He falls to such perusal of my face
5 1737 As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;
5 1738 At last,--a little shaking of mine arm,
5 1739 And thrice his head thus waving up and down,--
5 1740 He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound
5 1741 As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
5 1742 And end his being: that done, he lets me go:
5 1743 And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd
5 1744 He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;
5 1745 For out o' doors he went without their help,
5 1746 And to the last bended their light on me.
5 1747 
5 1748 Pol.
5 1749 Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.
5 1750 This is the very ecstasy of love;
5 1751 Whose violent property fordoes itself,
5 1752 And leads the will to desperate undertakings,
5 1753 As oft as any passion under heaven
5 1754 That does afflict our natures. I am sorry,--
5 1755 What, have you given him any hard words of late?
5 1756 
5 1757 Oph.
5 1758 No, my good lord; but, as you did command,
5 1759 I did repel his letters and denied
5 1760 His access to me.
5 1761 
5 1762 Pol.
5 1763 That hath made him mad.
5 1764 I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
5 1765 I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,
5 1766 And meant to wreck thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
5 1767 It seems it as proper to our age
5 1768 To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
5 1769 As it is common for the younger sort
5 1770 To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:
5 1771 This must be known; which, being kept close, might move
5 1772 More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
5 1773 
5 1774 [Exeunt.]
5 1775 
5 1776 
5 1777 
5 1778 Scene II. A room in the Castle.
5 1779 
5 1780 [Enter King, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and Attendants.]
5 1781 
5 1782 King.
5 1783 Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!
5 1784 Moreover that we much did long to see you,
5 1785 The need we have to use you did provoke
5 1786 Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
5 1787 Of Hamlet's transformation; so I call it,
5 1788 Since nor the exterior nor the inward man
5 1789 Resembles that it was. What it should be,
5 1790 More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
5 1791 So much from the understanding of himself,
5 1792 I cannot dream of: I entreat you both
5 1793 That, being of so young days brought up with him,
5 1794 And since so neighbour'd to his youth and humour,
5 1795 That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
5 1796 Some little time: so by your companies
5 1797 To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,
5 1798 So much as from occasion you may glean,
5 1799 Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,
5 1800 That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
5 1801 
5 1802 Queen.
5 1803 Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
5 1804 And sure I am two men there are not living
5 1805 To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
5 1806 To show us so much gentry and good-will
5 1807 As to expend your time with us awhile,
5 1808 For the supply and profit of our hope,
5 1809 Your visitation shall receive such thanks
5 1810 As fits a king's remembrance.
5 1811 
5 1812 Ros.
5 1813 Both your majesties
5 1814 Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
5 1815 Put your dread pleasures more into command
5 1816 Than to entreaty.
5 1817 
5 1818 Guil.
5 1819 We both obey,
5 1820 And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,
5 1821 To lay our service freely at your feet,
5 1822 To be commanded.
5 1823 
5 1824 King.
5 1825 Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
5 1826 
5 1827 Queen.
5 1828 Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:
5 1829 And I beseech you instantly to visit
5 1830 My too-much-changed son.--Go, some of you,
5 1831 And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
5 1832 
5 1833 Guil.
5 1834 Heavens make our presence and our practices
5 1835 Pleasant and helpful to him!
5 1836 
5 1837 Queen.
5 1838 Ay, amen!
5 1839 
5 1840 [Exeunt Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and some Attendants].
5 1841 
5 1842 [Enter Polonius.]
5 1843 
5 1844 Pol.
5 1845 Th' ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
5 1846 Are joyfully return'd.
5 1847 
5 1848 King.
5 1849 Thou still hast been the father of good news.
5 1850 
5 1851 Pol.
5 1852 Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,
5 1853 I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,
5 1854 Both to my God and to my gracious king:
5 1855 And I do think,--or else this brain of mine
5 1856 Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
5 1857 As it hath us'd to do,--that I have found
5 1858 The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
5 1859 
5 1860 King.
5 1861 O, speak of that; that do I long to hear.
5 1862 
5 1863 Pol.
5 1864 Give first admittance to the ambassadors;
5 1865 My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
5 1866 
5 1867 King.
5 1868 Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
5 1869 
5 1870 [Exit Polonius.]
5 1871 
5 1872 He tells me, my sweet queen, he hath found
5 1873 The head and source of all your son's distemper.
5 1874 
5 1875 Queen.
5 1876 I doubt it is no other but the main,--
5 1877 His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.
5 1878 
5 1879 King.
5 1880 Well, we shall sift him.
5 1881 
5 1882 [Enter Polonius, with Voltimand and Cornelius.]
5 1883 
5 1884 Welcome, my good friends!
5 1885 Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?
5 1886 
5 1887 Volt.
5 1888 Most fair return of greetings and desires.
5 1889 Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
5 1890 His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
5 1891 To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;
5 1892 But, better look'd into, he truly found
5 1893 It was against your highness; whereat griev'd,--
5 1894 That so his sickness, age, and impotence
5 1895 Was falsely borne in hand,--sends out arrests
5 1896 On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;
5 1897 Receives rebuke from Norway; and, in fine,
5 1898 Makes vow before his uncle never more
5 1899 To give th' assay of arms against your majesty.
5 1900 Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
5 1901 Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee;
5 1902 And his commission to employ those soldiers,
5 1903 So levied as before, against the Polack:
5 1904 With an entreaty, herein further shown,
5 1905 [Gives a paper.]
5 1906 That it might please you to give quiet pass
5 1907 Through your dominions for this enterprise,
5 1908 On such regards of safety and allowance
5 1909 As therein are set down.
5 1910 
5 1911 King.
5 1912 It likes us well;
5 1913 And at our more consider'd time we'll read,
5 1914 Answer, and think upon this business.
5 1915 Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour:
5 1916 Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together:
5 1917 Most welcome home!
5 1918 
5 1919 [Exeunt Voltimand and Cornelius.]
5 1920 
5 1921 Pol.
5 1922 This business is well ended.--
5 1923 My liege, and madam,--to expostulate
5 1924 What majesty should be, what duty is,
5 1925 Why day is day, night is night, and time is time.
5 1926 Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.
5 1927 Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
5 1928 And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
5 1929 I will be brief:--your noble son is mad:
5 1930 Mad call I it; for to define true madness,
5 1931 What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
5 1932 But let that go.
5 1933 
5 1934 Queen.
5 1935 More matter, with less art.
5 1936 
5 1937 Pol.
5 1938 Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
5 1939 That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
5 1940 And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;
5 1941 But farewell it, for I will use no art.
5 1942 Mad let us grant him then: and now remains
5 1943 That we find out the cause of this effect;
5 1944 Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
5 1945 For this effect defective comes by cause:
5 1946 Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.
5 1947 Perpend.
5 1948 I have a daughter,--have whilst she is mine,--
5 1949 Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,
5 1950 Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise.
5 1951 [Reads.]
5 1952 'To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified
5 1953 Ophelia,'--
5 1954 That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile
5 1955 phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:
5 1956 [Reads.]
5 1957 'In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.'
5 1958 
5 1959 Queen.
5 1960 Came this from Hamlet to her?
5 1961 
5 1962 Pol.
5 1963 Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.
5 1964 [Reads.]
5 1965   'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
5 1966      Doubt that the sun doth move;
5 1967    Doubt truth to be a liar;
5 1968      But never doubt I love.
5 1969 'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers; I have not art to
5 1970 reckon my groans: but that I love thee best, O most best, believe
5 1971 it. Adieu.
5 1972   'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him,
5 1973      HAMLET.'
5 1974 This, in obedience, hath my daughter show'd me;
5 1975 And more above, hath his solicitings,
5 1976 As they fell out by time, by means, and place,
5 1977 All given to mine ear.
5 1978 
5 1979 King.
5 1980 But how hath she
5 1981 Receiv'd his love?
5 1982 
5 1983 Pol.
5 1984 What do you think of me?
5 1985 
5 1986 King.
5 1987 As of a man faithful and honourable.
5 1988 
5 1989 Pol.
5 1990 I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
5 1991 When I had seen this hot love on the wing,--
5 1992 As I perceiv'd it, I must tell you that,
5 1993 Before my daughter told me,-- what might you,
5 1994 Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,
5 1995 If I had play'd the desk or table-book,
5 1996 Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb;
5 1997 Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;--
5 1998 What might you think? No, I went round to work,
5 1999 And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
5 2000 'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy sphere;
5 2001 This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,
5 2002 That she should lock herself from his resort,
5 2003 Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
5 2004 Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;
5 2005 And he, repulsed,--a short tale to make,--
5 2006 Fell into a sadness; then into a fast;
5 2007 Thence to a watch; thence into a weakness;
5 2008 Thence to a lightness; and, by this declension,
5 2009 Into the madness wherein now he raves,
5 2010 And all we wail for.
5 2011 
5 2012 King.
5 2013 Do you think 'tis this?
5 2014 
5 2015 Queen.
5 2016 It may be, very likely.
5 2017 
5 2018 Pol.
5 2019 Hath there been such a time,--I'd fain know that--
5 2020 That I have positively said ''Tis so,'
5 2021 When it prov'd otherwise?
5 2022 
5 2023 King.
5 2024 Not that I know.
5 2025 
5 2026 Pol.
5 2027 Take this from this, if this be otherwise:
5 2028 [Points to his head and shoulder.]
5 2029 If circumstances lead me, I will find
5 2030 Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
5 2031 Within the centre.
5 2032 
5 2033 King.
5 2034 How may we try it further?
5 2035 
5 2036 Pol.
5 2037 You know sometimes he walks for hours together
5 2038 Here in the lobby.
5 2039 
5 2040 Queen.
5 2041 So he does indeed.
5 2042 
5 2043 Pol.
5 2044 At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:
5 2045 Be you and I behind an arras then;
5 2046 Mark the encounter: if he love her not,
5 2047 And he not from his reason fall'n thereon
5 2048 Let me be no assistant for a state,
5 2049 But keep a farm and carters.
5 2050 
5 2051 King.
5 2052 We will try it.
5 2053 
5 2054 Queen.
5 2055 But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
5 2056 
5 2057 Pol.
5 2058 Away, I do beseech you, both away
5 2059 I'll board him presently:--O, give me leave.
5 2060 
5 2061 [Exeunt King, Queen, and Attendants.]
5 2062 
5 2063 [Enter Hamlet, reading.]
5 2064 
5 2065 How does my good Lord Hamlet?
5 2066 
5 2067 Ham.
5 2068 Well, God-a-mercy.
5 2069 
5 2070 Pol.
5 2071 Do you know me, my lord?
5 2072 
5 2073 Ham.
5 2074 Excellent well; you're a fishmonger.
5 2075 
5 2076 Pol.
5 2077 Not I, my lord.
5 2078 
5 2079 Ham.
5 2080 Then I would you were so honest a man.
5 2081 
5 2082 Pol.
5 2083 Honest, my lord!
5 2084 
5 2085 Ham.
5 2086 Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man
5 2087 picked out of ten thousand.
5 2088 
5 2089 Pol.
5 2090 That's very true, my lord.
5 2091 
5 2092 Ham.
5 2093 For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god-kissing
5 2094 carrion,--Have you a daughter?
5 2095 
5 2096 Pol.
5 2097 I have, my lord.
5 2098 
5 2099 Ham.
5 2100 Let her not walk i' the sun: conception is a blessing, but not
5 2101 as your daughter may conceive:--friend, look to't.
5 2102 
5 2103 Pol.
5 2104 How say you by that?--[Aside.] Still harping on my daughter:--yet
5 2105 he knew me not at first; he said I was a fishmonger: he is far
5 2106 gone, far gone: and truly in my youth I suffered much extremity
5 2107 for love; very near this. I'll speak to him again.--What do you
5 2108 read, my lord?
5 2109 
5 2110 Ham.
5 2111 Words, words, words.
5 2112 
5 2113 Pol.
5 2114 What is the matter, my lord?
5 2115 
5 2116 Ham.
5 2117 Between who?
5 2118 
5 2119 Pol.
5 2120 I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
5 2121 
5 2122 Ham.
5 2123 Slanders, sir: for the satirical slave says here that old men
5 2124 have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes
5 2125 purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a
5 2126 plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams: all which,
5 2127 sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it
5 2128 not honesty to have it thus set down; for you yourself, sir,
5 2129 should be old as I am, if, like a crab, you could go backward.
5 2130 
5 2131 Pol.
5 2132 [Aside.] Though this be madness, yet there is a method in't.--
5 2133 Will you walk out of the air, my lord?
5 2134 
5 2135 Ham.
5 2136 Into my grave?
5 2137 
5 2138 Pol.
5 2139 Indeed, that is out o' the air. [Aside.] How pregnant sometimes
5 2140 his replies are! a happiness that often madness hits on, which
5 2141 reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. I
5 2142 will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between
5 2143 him and my daughter.--My honourable lord, I will most humbly take
5 2144 my leave of you.
5 2145 
5 2146 Ham.
5 2147 You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more
5 2148 willingly part withal,--except my life, except my life, except my
5 2149 life.
5 2150 
5 2151 Pol.
5 2152 Fare you well, my lord.
5 2153 
5 2154 Ham.
5 2155 These tedious old fools!
5 2156 
5 2157 [Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
5 2158 
5 2159 Pol.
5 2160 You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.
5 2161 
5 2162 Ros.
5 2163 [To Polonius.] God save you, sir!
5 2164 
5 2165 [Exit Polonius.]
5 2166 
5 2167 Guil.
5 2168 My honoured lord!
5 2169 
5 2170 Ros.
5 2171 My most dear lord!
5 2172 
5 2173 Ham.
5 2174 My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah,
5 2175 Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
5 2176 
5 2177 Ros.
5 2178 As the indifferent children of the earth.
5 2179 
5 2180 Guil.
5 2181 Happy in that we are not over-happy;
5 2182 On fortune's cap we are not the very button.
5 2183 
5 2184 Ham.
5 2185 Nor the soles of her shoe?
5 2186 
5 2187 Ros.
5 2188 Neither, my lord.
5 2189 
5 2190 Ham.
5 2191 Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her
5 2192 favours?
5 2193 
5 2194 Guil.
5 2195 Faith, her privates we.
5 2196 
5 2197 Ham.
5 2198 In the secret parts of fortune? O, most true; she is a
5 2199 strumpet. What's the news?
5 2200 
5 2201 Ros.
5 2202 None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
5 2203 
5 2204 Ham.
5 2205 Then is doomsday near; but your news is not true. Let me
5 2206 question more in particular: what have you, my good friends,
5 2207 deserved at the hands of fortune, that she sends you to prison
5 2208 hither?
5 2209 
5 2210 Guil.
5 2211 Prison, my lord!
5 2212 
5 2213 Ham.
5 2214 Denmark's a prison.
5 2215 
5 2216 Ros.
5 2217 Then is the world one.
5 2218 
5 2219 Ham.
5 2220 A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and
5 2221 dungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst.
5 2222 
5 2223 Ros.
5 2224 We think not so, my lord.
5 2225 
5 2226 Ham.
5 2227 Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either good
5 2228 or bad but thinking makes it so: to me it is a prison.
5 2229 
5 2230 Ros.
5 2231 Why, then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too narrow for your
5 2232 mind.
5 2233 
5 2234 Ham.
5 2235 O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell, and count myself a
5 2236 king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.
5 2237 
5 2238 Guil.
5 2239 Which dreams, indeed, are ambition; for the very substance of
5 2240 the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
5 2241 
5 2242 Ham.
5 2243 A dream itself is but a shadow.
5 2244 
5 2245 Ros.
5 2246 Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that
5 2247 it is but a shadow's shadow.
5 2248 
5 2249 Ham.
5 2250 Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch'd
5 2251 heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to the court? for, by my
5 2252 fay, I cannot reason.
5 2253 
5 2254 Ros. and Guild.
5 2255 We'll wait upon you.
5 2256 
5 2257 Ham.
5 2258 No such matter: I will not sort you with the rest of my
5 2259 servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most
5 2260 dreadfully attended. But, in the beaten way of friendship, what
5 2261 make you at Elsinore?
5 2262 
5 2263 Ros.
5 2264 To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
5 2265 
5 2266 Ham.
5 2267 Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you:
5 2268 and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were
5 2269 you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free
5 2270 visitation? Come, deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.
5 2271 
5 2272 Guil.
5 2273 What should we say, my lord?
5 2274 
5 2275 Ham.
5 2276 Why, anything--but to the purpose. You were sent for; and
5 2277 there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your modesties
5 2278 have not craft enough to colour: I know the good king and queen
5 2279 have sent for you.
5 2280 
5 2281 Ros.
5 2282 To what end, my lord?
5 2283 
5 2284 Ham.
5 2285 That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by the rights
5 2286 of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the
5 2287 obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a
5 2288 better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct with
5 2289 me, whether you were sent for or no.
5 2290 
5 2291 Ros.
5 2292 [To Guildenstern.] What say you?
5 2293 
5 2294 Ham.
5 2295 [Aside.] Nay, then, I have an eye of you.--If you love me, hold
5 2296 not off.
5 2297 
5 2298 Guil.
5 2299 My lord, we were sent for.
5 2300 
5 2301 Ham.
5 2302 I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation prevent your
5 2303 discovery, and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no
5 2304 feather. I have of late,--but wherefore I know not,--lost all my
5 2305 mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes so
5 2306 heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth,
5 2307 seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy, the
5 2308 air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this majestical
5 2309 roof fretted with golden fire,--why, it appears no other thing
5 2310 to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a
5 2311 piece of work is man! How noble in reason! how infinite in
5 2312 faculties! in form and moving, how express and admirable! in
5 2313 action how like an angel! in apprehension, how like a god! the
5 2314 beauty of the world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me, what
5 2315 is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me; no, nor woman
5 2316 neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.
5 2317 
5 2318 Ros.
5 2319 My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
5 2320 
5 2321 Ham.
5 2322 Why did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?
5 2323 
5 2324 Ros.
5 2325 To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten
5 2326 entertainment the players shall receive from you: we coted them
5 2327 on the way; and hither are they coming to offer you service.
5 2328 
5 2329 Ham.
5 2330 He that plays the king shall be welcome,--his majesty shall
5 2331 have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and
5 2332 target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man shall
5 2333 end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
5 2334 lungs are tickle o' the sere; and the lady shall say her mind
5 2335 freely, or the blank verse shall halt for't. What players are
5 2336 they?
5 2337 
5 2338 Ros.
5 2339 Even those you were wont to take such delight in,--the
5 2340 tragedians of the city.
5 2341 
5 2342 Ham.
5 2343 How chances it they travel? their residence, both in
5 2344 reputation and profit, was better both ways.
5 2345 
5 2346 Ros.
5 2347 I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late
5 2348 innovation.
5 2349 
5 2350 Ham.
5 2351 Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the
5 2352 city? Are they so followed?
5 2353 
5 2354 Ros.
5 2355 No, indeed, are they not.
5 2356 
5 2357 Ham.
5 2358 How comes it? do they grow rusty?
5 2359 
5 2360 Ros.
5 2361 Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but there is,
5 2362 sir, an aery of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top
5 2363 of question, and are most tyrannically clapped for't: these are
5 2364 now the fashion; and so berattle the common stages,--so they call
5 2365 them,--that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose-quills and
5 2366 dare scarce come thither.
5 2367 
5 2368 Ham.
5 2369 What, are they children? who maintains 'em? How are they
5 2370 escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can
5 2371 sing? will they not say afterwards, if they should grow
5 2372 themselves to common players,--as it is most like, if their means
5 2373 are no better,--their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim
5 2374 against their own succession?
5 2375 
5 2376 Ros.
5 2377 Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation
5 2378 holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy: there was, for
5 2379 awhile, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player
5 2380 went to cuffs in the question.
5 2381 
5 2382 Ham.
5 2383 Is't possible?
5 2384 
5 2385 Guil.
5 2386 O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
5 2387 
5 2388 Ham.
5 2389 Do the boys carry it away?
5 2390 
5 2391 Ros.
5 2392 Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.
5 2393 
5 2394 Ham.
5 2395 It is not very strange; for my uncle is king of Denmark, and
5 2396 those that would make mouths at him while my father lived, give
5 2397 twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in
5 2398 little. 'Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if
5 2399 philosophy could find it out.
5 2400 
5 2401 [Flourish of trumpets within.]
5 2402 
5 2403 Guil.
5 2404 There are the players.
5 2405 
5 2406 Ham.
5 2407 Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come: the
5 2408 appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony: let me comply
5 2409 with you in this garb; lest my extent to the players, which I
5 2410 tell you must show fairly outward, should more appear like
5 2411 entertainment than yours. You are welcome: but my uncle-father
5 2412 and aunt-mother are deceived.
5 2413 
5 2414 Guil.
5 2415 In what, my dear lord?
5 2416 
5 2417 Ham.
5 2418 I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is southerly I
5 2419 know a hawk from a handsaw.
5 2420 
5 2421 [Enter Polonius.]
5 2422 
5 2423 Pol.
5 2424 Well be with you, gentlemen!
5 2425 
5 2426 Ham.
5 2427 Hark you, Guildenstern;--and you too;--at each ear a hearer: that
5 2428 great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts.
5 2429 
5 2430 Ros.
5 2431 Happily he's the second time come to them; for they say an old
5 2432 man is twice a child.
5 2433 
5 2434 Ham.
5 2435 I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players; mark it.--You
5 2436 say right, sir: o' Monday morning; 'twas so indeed.
5 2437 
5 2438 Pol.
5 2439 My lord, I have news to tell you.
5 2440 
5 2441 Ham.
5 2442 My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in
5 2443 Rome,--
5 2444 
5 2445 Pol.
5 2446 The actors are come hither, my lord.
5 2447 
5 2448 Ham.
5 2449 Buzz, buzz!
5 2450 
5 2451 Pol.
5 2452 Upon my honour,--
5 2453 
5 2454 Ham.
5 2455 Then came each actor on his ass,--
5 2456 
5 2457 Pol.
5 2458 The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,
5 2459 history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,
5 2460 tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene
5 2461 individable, or poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy nor
5 2462 Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these are
5 2463 the only men.
5 2464 
5 2465 Ham.
5 2466 O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
5 2467 
5 2468 Pol.
5 2469 What treasure had he, my lord?
5 2470 
5 2471 Ham.
5 2472 Why--
5 2473    'One fair daughter, and no more,
5 2474    The which he loved passing well.'
5 2475 
5 2476 
5 2477 Pol.
5 2478 [Aside.] Still on my daughter.
5 2479 
5 2480 Ham.
5 2481 Am I not i' the right, old Jephthah?
5 2482 
5 2483 Pol.
5 2484 If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I
5 2485 love passing well.
5 2486 
5 2487 Ham.
5 2488 Nay, that follows not.
5 2489 
5 2490 Pol.
5 2491 What follows, then, my lord?
5 2492 
5 2493 Ham.
5 2494 Why--
5 2495    'As by lot, God wot,'
5 2496 and then, you know,
5 2497    'It came to pass, as most like it was--'
5 2498 The first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for look
5 2499 where my abridgment comes.
5 2500 
5 2501 [Enter four or five Players.]
5 2502 
5 2503 You are welcome, masters; welcome, all:--I am glad to see thee
5 2504 well.--welcome, good friends.--O, my old friend! Thy face is
5 2505 valanc'd since I saw thee last; comest thou to beard me in
5 2506 Denmark?--What, my young lady and mistress! By'r lady, your
5 2507 ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the
5 2508 altitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, like a piece of
5 2509 uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the ring.--Masters, you are
5 2510 all welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly at
5 2511 anything we see: we'll have a speech straight: come, give us a
5 2512 taste of your quality: come, a passionate speech.
5 2513 
5 2514 I Play.
5 2515 What speech, my lord?
5 2516 
5 2517 Ham.
5 2518 I heard thee speak me a speech once,--but it was never acted;
5 2519 or if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember, pleased
5 2520 not the million, 'twas caviare to the general; but it was,--as I
5 2521 received it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in
5 2522 the top of mine,--an excellent play, well digested in the scenes,
5 2523 set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember, one said
5 2524 there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury,
5 2525 nor no matter in the phrase that might indite the author of
5 2526 affectation; but called it an honest method, as wholesome as
5 2527 sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in it
5 2528 I chiefly loved: 'twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout of it
5 2529 especially where he speaks of Priam's slaughter: if it live in
5 2530 your memory, begin at this line;--let me see, let me see:--
5 2531 
5 2532 The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast,--
5 2533 
5 2534 it is not so:-- it begins with Pyrrhus:--
5 2535 
5 2536   'The rugged Pyrrhus,--he whose sable arms,
5 2537    Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
5 2538    When he lay couched in the ominous horse,--
5 2539    Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
5 2540    With heraldry more dismal; head to foot
5 2541    Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd
5 2542    With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
5 2543    Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,
5 2544    That lend a tyrannous and a damned light
5 2545    To their vile murders: roasted in wrath and fire,
5 2546    And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,
5 2547    With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
5 2548    Old grandsire Priam seeks.'
5 2549 
5 2550 So, proceed you.
5 2551 
5 2552 Pol.
5 2553 'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good
5 2554 discretion.
5 2555 
5 2556 I Play.
5 2557    Anon he finds him,
5 2558    Striking too short at Greeks: his antique sword,
5 2559    Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
5 2560    Repugnant to command: unequal match'd,
5 2561    Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;
5 2562    But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
5 2563    The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
5 2564    Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
5 2565    Stoops to his base; and with a hideous crash
5 2566    Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for lo! his sword,
5 2567    Which was declining on the milky head
5 2568    Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:
5 2569    So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood;
5 2570    And, like a neutral to his will and matter,
5 2571    Did nothing.
5 2572    But as we often see, against some storm,
5 2573    A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
5 2574    The bold winds speechless, and the orb below
5 2575    As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder
5 2576    Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
5 2577    A roused vengeance sets him new a-work;
5 2578    And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
5 2579    On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,
5 2580    With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
5 2581    Now falls on Priam.--
5 2582    Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,
5 2583    In general synod, take away her power;
5 2584    Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
5 2585    And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
5 2586    As low as to the fiends!
5 2587 
5 2588 Pol.
5 2589 This is too long.
5 2590 
5 2591 Ham.
5 2592 It shall to the barber's, with your beard.--Pr'ythee say on.--
5 2593 He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps:--say on; come
5 2594 to Hecuba.
5 2595 
5 2596 I Play.
5 2597    But who, O who, had seen the mobled queen,--
5 2598 
5 2599 Ham.
5 2600 'The mobled queen'?
5 2601 
5 2602 Pol.
5 2603 That's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.
5 2604 
5 2605 I Play.
5 2606    Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames
5 2607    With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
5 2608    Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
5 2609    About her lank and all o'erteemed loins,
5 2610    A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up;--
5 2611    Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd,
5 2612    'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd:
5 2613    But if the gods themselves did see her then,
5 2614    When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
5 2615    In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
5 2616    The instant burst of clamour that she made,--
5 2617    Unless things mortal move them not at all,--
5 2618    Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,
5 2619    And passion in the gods.
5 2620 
5 2621 Pol.
5 2622 Look, whether he has not turn'd his colour, and has tears in's
5 2623 eyes.--Pray you, no more!
5 2624 
5 2625 Ham.
5 2626 'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon.--
5 2627 Good my lord, will you see the players well bestowed? Do you
5 2628 hear? Let them be well used; for they are the abstracts and brief
5 2629 chronicles of the time; after your death you were better have a
5 2630 bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.
5 2631 
5 2632 Pol.
5 2633 My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
5 2634 
5 2635 Ham.
5 2636 Odd's bodikin, man, better: use every man after his
5 2637 desert, and who should scape whipping? Use them after your own
5 2638 honour and dignity: the less they deserve, the more merit is in
5 2639 your bounty. Take them in.
5 2640 
5 2641 Pol.
5 2642 Come, sirs.
5 2643 
5 2644 Ham.
5 2645 Follow him, friends: we'll hear a play to-morrow.
5 2646 
5 2647 [Exeunt Polonius with all the Players but the First.]
5 2648 
5 2649 Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play 'The Murder of
5 2650 Gonzago'?
5 2651 
5 2652 I Play.
5 2653 Ay, my lord.
5 2654 
5 2655 Ham.
5 2656 We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a
5 2657 speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down and
5 2658 insert in't? could you not?
5 2659 
5 2660 I Play.
5 2661 Ay, my lord.
5 2662 
5 2663 Ham.
5 2664 Very well.--Follow that lord; and look you mock him not.
5 2665 
5 2666 [Exit First Player.]
5 2667 
5 2668 --My good friends [to Ros. and Guild.], I'll leave you till
5 2669 night: you are welcome to Elsinore.
5 2670 
5 2671 Ros.
5 2672 Good my lord!
5 2673 
5 2674 [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
5 2675 
5 2676 Ham.
5 2677 Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!
5 2678 Now I am alone.
5 2679 O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
5 2680 Is it not monstrous that this player here,
5 2681 But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
5 2682 Could force his soul so to his own conceit
5 2683 That from her working all his visage wan'd;
5 2684 Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
5 2685 A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
5 2686 With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!
5 2687 For Hecuba?
5 2688 What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
5 2689 That he should weep for her? What would he do,
5 2690 Had he the motive and the cue for passion
5 2691 That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
5 2692 And cleave the general ear with horrid speech;
5 2693 Make mad the guilty, and appal the free;
5 2694 Confound the ignorant, and amaze, indeed,
5 2695 The very faculties of eyes and ears.
5 2696 Yet I,
5 2697 A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,
5 2698 Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
5 2699 And can say nothing; no, not for a king
5 2700 Upon whose property and most dear life
5 2701 A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
5 2702 Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
5 2703 Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?
5 2704 Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat
5 2705 As deep as to the lungs? who does me this, ha?
5 2706 'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be
5 2707 But I am pigeon-liver'd, and lack gall
5 2708 To make oppression bitter; or ere this
5 2709 I should have fatted all the region kites
5 2710 With this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain!
5 2711 Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
5 2712 O, vengeance!
5 2713 Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
5 2714 That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,
5 2715 Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
5 2716 Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words
5 2717 And fall a-cursing like a very drab,
5 2718 A scullion!
5 2719 Fie upon't! foh!--About, my brain! I have heard
5 2720 That guilty creatures, sitting at a play,
5 2721 Have by the very cunning of the scene
5 2722 Been struck so to the soul that presently
5 2723 They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
5 2724 For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak
5 2725 With most miraculous organ, I'll have these players
5 2726 Play something like the murder of my father
5 2727 Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;
5 2728 I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,
5 2729 I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
5 2730 May be the devil: and the devil hath power
5 2731 To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
5 2732 Out of my weakness and my melancholy,--
5 2733 As he is very potent with such spirits,--
5 2734 Abuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds
5 2735 More relative than this.--the play's the thing
5 2736 Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.

5 2743 ACT III.
5 2744 
5 2745 Scene I. A room in the Castle.
5 2746 
5 2747 [Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, and
5 2748 Guildenstern.]
5 2749 
5 2750 King.
5 2751 And can you, by no drift of circumstance,
5 2752 Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
5 2753 Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
5 2754 With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
5 2755 
5 2756 Ros.
5 2757 He does confess he feels himself distracted,
5 2758 But from what cause he will by no means speak.
5 2759 
5 2760 Guil.
5 2761 Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
5 2762 But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof
5 2763 When we would bring him on to some confession
5 2764 Of his true state.
5 2765 
5 2766 Queen.
5 2767 Did he receive you well?
5 2768 
5 2769 Ros.
5 2770 Most like a gentleman.
5 2771 
5 2772 Guil.
5 2773 But with much forcing of his disposition.
5 2774 
5 2775 Ros.
5 2776 Niggard of question; but, of our demands,
5 2777 Most free in his reply.
5 2778 
5 2779 Queen.
5 2780 Did you assay him
5 2781 To any pastime?
5 2782 
5 2783 Ros.
5 2784 Madam, it so fell out that certain players
5 2785 We o'er-raught on the way: of these we told him,
5 2786 And there did seem in him a kind of joy
5 2787 To hear of it: they are about the court,
5 2788 And, as I think, they have already order
5 2789 This night to play before him.
5 2790 
5 2791 Pol.
5 2792 'Tis most true;
5 2793 And he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties
5 2794 To hear and see the matter.
5 2795 
5 2796 King.
5 2797 With all my heart; and it doth much content me
5 2798 To hear him so inclin'd.--
5 2799 Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,
5 2800 And drive his purpose on to these delights.
5 2801 
5 2802 Ros.
5 2803 We shall, my lord.
5 2804 
5 2805 [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
5 2806 
5 2807 King.
5 2808 Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
5 2809 For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
5 2810 That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
5 2811 Affront Ophelia:
5 2812 Her father and myself,--lawful espials,--
5 2813 Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen,
5 2814 We may of their encounter frankly judge;
5 2815 And gather by him, as he is behav'd,
5 2816 If't be the affliction of his love or no
5 2817 That thus he suffers for.
5 2818 
5 2819 Queen.
5 2820 I shall obey you:--
5 2821 And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
5 2822 That your good beauties be the happy cause
5 2823 Of Hamlet's wildness: so shall I hope your virtues
5 2824 Will bring him to his wonted way again,
5 2825 To both your honours.
5 2826 
5 2827 Oph.
5 2828 Madam, I wish it may.
5 2829 
5 2830 [Exit Queen.]
5 2831 
5 2832 Pol.
5 2833 Ophelia, walk you here.--Gracious, so please you,
5 2834 We will bestow ourselves.--[To Ophelia.] Read on this book;
5 2835 That show of such an exercise may colour
5 2836 Your loneliness.--We are oft to blame in this,--
5 2837 'Tis too much prov'd,--that with devotion's visage
5 2838 And pious action we do sugar o'er
5 2839 The Devil himself.
5 2840 
5 2841 King.
5 2842 [Aside.] O, 'tis too true!
5 2843 How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
5 2844 The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art,
5 2845 Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
5 2846 Than is my deed to my most painted word:
5 2847 O heavy burden!
5 2848 
5 2849 Pol.
5 2850 I hear him coming: let's withdraw, my lord.
5 2851 
5 2852 [Exeunt King and Polonius.]
5 2853 
5 2854 [Enter Hamlet.]
5 2855 
5 2856 Ham.
5 2857 To be, or not to be,--that is the question:--
5 2858 Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
5 2859 The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
5 2860 Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
5 2861 And by opposing end them?--To die,--to sleep,--
5 2862 No more; and by a sleep to say we end
5 2863 The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
5 2864 That flesh is heir to,--'tis a consummation
5 2865 Devoutly to be wish'd. To die,--to sleep;--
5 2866 To sleep! perchance to dream:--ay, there's the rub;
5 2867 For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,
5 2868 When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
5 2869 Must give us pause: there's the respect
5 2870 That makes calamity of so long life;
5 2871 For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
5 2872 The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
5 2873 The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,
5 2874 The insolence of office, and the spurns
5 2875 That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
5 2876 When he himself might his quietus make
5 2877 With a bare bodkin? who would these fardels bear,
5 2878 To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
5 2879 But that the dread of something after death,--
5 2880 The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn
5 2881 No traveller returns,--puzzles the will,
5 2882 And makes us rather bear those ills we have
5 2883 Than fly to others that we know not of?
5 2884 Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
5 2885 And thus the native hue of resolution
5 2886 Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought;
5 2887 And enterprises of great pith and moment,
5 2888 With this regard, their currents turn awry,
5 2889 And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!
5 2890 The fair Ophelia!--Nymph, in thy orisons
5 2891 Be all my sins remember'd.
5 2892 
5 2893 Oph.
5 2894 Good my lord,
5 2895 How does your honour for this many a day?
5 2896 
5 2897 Ham.
5 2898 I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
5 2899 
5 2900 Oph.
5 2901 My lord, I have remembrances of yours
5 2902 That I have longed long to re-deliver.
5 2903 I pray you, now receive them.
5 2904 
5 2905 Ham.
5 2906 No, not I;
5 2907 I never gave you aught.
5 2908 
5 2909 Oph.
5 2910 My honour'd lord, you know right well you did;
5 2911 And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd
5 2912 As made the things more rich; their perfume lost,
5 2913 Take these again; for to the noble mind
5 2914 Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
5 2915 There, my lord.
5 2916 
5 2917 Ham.
5 2918 Ha, ha! are you honest?
5 2919 
5 2920 Oph.
5 2921 My lord?
5 2922 
5 2923 Ham.
5 2924 Are you fair?
5 2925 
5 2926 Oph.
5 2927 What means your lordship?
5 2928 
5 2929 Ham.
5 2930 That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no
5 2931 discourse to your beauty.
5 2932 
5 2933 Oph.
5 2934 Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?
5 2935 
5 2936 Ham.
5 2937 Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform
5 2938 honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can
5 2939 translate beauty into his likeness: this was sometime a paradox,
5 2940 but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.
5 2941 
5 2942 Oph.
5 2943 Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
5 2944 
5 2945 Ham.
5 2946 You should not have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so
5 2947 inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it: I loved you
5 2948 not.
5 2949 
5 2950 Oph.
5 2951 I was the more deceived.
5 2952 
5 2953 Ham.
5 2954 Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a breeder of
5 2955 sinners? I am myself indifferent honest; but yet I could accuse
5 2956 me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me:
5 2957 I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at my
5 2958 beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give
5 2959 them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows as I
5 2960 do crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves, all;
5 2961 believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's your
5 2962 father?
5 2963 
5 2964 Oph.
5 2965 At home, my lord.
5 2966 
5 2967 Ham.
5 2968 Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
5 2969 nowhere but in's own house. Farewell.
5 2970 
5 2971 Oph.
5 2972 O, help him, you sweet heavens!
5 2973 
5 2974 Ham.
5 2975 If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry,--
5 2976 be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape
5 2977 calumny. Get thee to a nunnery, go: farewell. Or, if thou wilt
5 2978 needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what
5 2979 monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too.
5 2980 Farewell.
5 2981 
5 2982 Oph.
5 2983 O heavenly powers, restore him!
5 2984 
5 2985 Ham.
5 2986 I have heard of your paintings too, well enough; God hath
5 2987 given you one face, and you make yourselves another: you jig, you
5 2988 amble, and you lisp, and nickname God's creatures, and make your
5 2989 wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't; it hath made
5 2990 me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages: those that are
5 2991 married already, all but one, shall live; the rest shall keep as
5 2992 they are. To a nunnery, go.
5 2993 
5 2994 [Exit.]
5 2995 
5 2996 Oph.
5 2997 O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
5 2998 The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,
5 2999 The expectancy and rose of the fair state,
5 3000 The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
5 3001 The observ'd of all observers,--quite, quite down!
5 3002 And I, of ladies most deject and wretched
5 3003 That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
5 3004 Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
5 3005 Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
5 3006 That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
5 3007 Blasted with ecstasy: O, woe is me,
5 3008 To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!
5 3009 
5 3010 [Re-enter King and Polonius.]
5 3011 
5 3012 King.
5 3013 Love! his affections do not that way tend;
5 3014 Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
5 3015 Was not like madness. There's something in his soul
5 3016 O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
5 3017 And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
5 3018 Will be some danger: which for to prevent,
5 3019 I have in quick determination
5 3020 Thus set it down:--he shall with speed to England
5 3021 For the demand of our neglected tribute:
5 3022 Haply the seas, and countries different,
5 3023 With variable objects, shall expel
5 3024 This something-settled matter in his heart;
5 3025 Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
5 3026 From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
5 3027 
5 3028 Pol.
5 3029 It shall do well: but yet do I believe
5 3030 The origin and commencement of his grief
5 3031 Sprung from neglected love.--How now, Ophelia!
5 3032 You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;
5 3033 We heard it all.--My lord, do as you please;
5 3034 But if you hold it fit, after the play,
5 3035 Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
5 3036 To show his grief: let her be round with him;
5 3037 And I'll be plac'd, so please you, in the ear
5 3038 Of all their conference. If she find him not,
5 3039 To England send him; or confine him where
5 3040 Your wisdom best shall think.
5 3041 
5 3042 King.
5 3043 It shall be so:
5 3044 Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.
5 3045 
5 3046 [Exeunt.]
5 3047 
5 3048 
5 3049 
5 3050 Scene II. A hall in the Castle.
5 3051 
5 3052 [Enter Hamlet and certain Players.]
5 3053 
5 3054 Ham.
5 3055 Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you,
5 3056 trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it, as many of your
5 3057 players do, I had as lief the town crier spoke my lines. Nor do
5 3058 not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all
5 3059 gently: for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,
5 3060 whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget a
5 3061 temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the
5 3062 soul, to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to
5 3063 tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who,
5 3064 for the most part, are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb
5 3065 shows and noise: I would have such a fellow whipped for o'erdoing
5 3066 Termagant; it out-herods Herod: pray you avoid it.
5 3067 
5 3068 I Player.
5 3069 I warrant your honour.
5 3070 
5 3071 Ham.
5 3072 Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be your
5 3073 tutor: suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with
5 3074 this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of
5 3075 nature: for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing,
5 3076 whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as
5 3077 'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own image,
5 3078 scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his
5 3079 form and pressure. Now, this overdone, or come tardy off, though
5 3080 it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious
5 3081 grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance,
5 3082 o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I
5 3083 have seen play,--and heard others praise, and that highly,--not
5 3084 to speak it profanely, that, neither having the accent of
5 3085 Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so
5 3086 strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of nature's
5 3087 journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated
5 3088 humanity so abominably.
5 3089 
5 3090 I Player.
5 3091 I hope we have reform'd that indifferently with us, sir.
5 3092 
5 3093 Ham.
5 3094 O, reform it altogether. And let those that play your clowns
5 3095 speak no more than is set down for them: for there be of them
5 3096 that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren
5 3097 spectators to laugh too, though in the meantime some necessary
5 3098 question of the play be then to be considered: that's villanous
5 3099 and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go
5 3100 make you ready.
5 3101 
5 3102 [Exeunt Players.]
5 3103 
5 3104 [Enter Polonius, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.]
5 3105 
5 3106 How now, my lord! will the king hear this piece of work?
5 3107 
5 3108 Pol.
5 3109 And the queen too, and that presently.
5 3110 
5 3111 Ham.
5 3112 Bid the players make haste.
5 3113 
5 3114 [Exit Polonius.]
5 3115 
5 3116 Will you two help to hasten them?
5 3117 
5 3118 Ros. and Guil.
5 3119 We will, my lord.
5 3120 
5 3121 [Exeunt Ros. and Guil.]
5 3122 
5 3123 Ham.
5 3124 What, ho, Horatio!
5 3125 
5 3126 [Enter Horatio.]
5 3127 
5 3128 Hor.
5 3129 Here, sweet lord, at your service.
5 3130 
5 3131 Ham.
5 3132 Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
5 3133 As e'er my conversation cop'd withal.
5 3134 
5 3135 Hor.
5 3136 O, my dear lord,--
5 3137 
5 3138 Ham.
5 3139 Nay, do not think I flatter;
5 3140 For what advancement may I hope from thee,
5 3141 That no revenue hast, but thy good spirits,
5 3142 To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
5 3143 No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp;
5 3144 And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
5 3145 Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
5 3146 Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice,
5 3147 And could of men distinguish, her election
5 3148 Hath seal'd thee for herself: for thou hast been
5 3149 As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing;
5 3150 A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards
5 3151 Hast ta'en with equal thanks: and bles'd are those
5 3152 Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled
5 3153 That they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger
5 3154 To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
5 3155 That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
5 3156 In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
5 3157 As I do thee.--Something too much of this.--
5 3158 There is a play to-night before the king;
5 3159 One scene of it comes near the circumstance,
5 3160 Which I have told thee, of my father's death:
5 3161 I pr'ythee, when thou see'st that act a-foot,
5 3162 Even with the very comment of thy soul
5 3163 Observe mine uncle: if his occulted guilt
5 3164 Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
5 3165 It is a damned ghost that we have seen;
5 3166 And my imaginations are as foul
5 3167 As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
5 3168 For I mine eyes will rivet to his face;
5 3169 And, after, we will both our judgments join
5 3170 In censure of his seeming.
5 3171 
5 3172 Hor.
5 3173 Well, my lord:
5 3174 If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
5 3175 And scape detecting, I will pay the theft.
5 3176 
5 3177 Ham.
5 3178 They are coming to the play. I must be idle:
5 3179 Get you a place.
5 3180 
5 3181 [Danish march. A flourish. Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia,
5 3182 Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and others.]
5 3183 
5 3184 King.
5 3185 How fares our cousin Hamlet?
5 3186 
5 3187 Ham.
5 3188 Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish: I eat the air,
5 3189 promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so.
5 3190 
5 3191 King.
5 3192 I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words are not
5 3193 mine.
5 3194 
5 3195 Ham.
5 3196 No, nor mine now. My lord, you play'd once i' the university, you
5 3197 say? [To Polonius.]
5 3198 
5 3199 Pol.
5 3200 That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.
5 3201 
5 3202 Ham.
5 3203 What did you enact?
5 3204 
5 3205 Pol.
5 3206 I did enact Julius Caesar; I was kill'd i' the Capitol; Brutus
5 3207 killed me.
5 3208 
5 3209 Ham.
5 3210 It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there.--Be
5 3211 the players ready?
5 3212 
5 3213 Ros.
5 3214 Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.
5 3215 
5 3216 Queen.
5 3217 Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
5 3218 
5 3219 Ham.
5 3220 No, good mother, here's metal more attractive.
5 3221 
5 3222 Pol.
5 3223 O, ho! do you mark that? [To the King.]
5 3224 
5 3225 Ham.
5 3226 Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
5 3227 [Lying down at Ophelia's feet.]
5 3228 
5 3229 Oph.
5 3230 No, my lord.
5 3231 
5 3232 Ham.
5 3233 I mean, my head upon your lap?
5 3234 
5 3235 Oph.
5 3236 Ay, my lord.
5 3237 
5 3238 Ham.
5 3239 Do you think I meant country matters?
5 3240 
5 3241 Oph.
5 3242 I think nothing, my lord.
5 3243 
5 3244 Ham.
5 3245 That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
5 3246 
5 3247 Oph.
5 3248 What is, my lord?
5 3249 
5 3250 Ham.
5 3251 Nothing.
5 3252 
5 3253 Oph.
5 3254 You are merry, my lord.
5 3255 
5 3256 Ham.
5 3257 Who, I?
5 3258 
5 3259 Oph.
5 3260 Ay, my lord.
5 3261 
5 3262 Ham.
5 3263 O, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be merry?
5 3264 for look you how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died
5 3265 within 's two hours.
5 3266 
5 3267 Oph.
5 3268 Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.
5 3269 
5 3270 Ham.
5 3271 So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have a
5 3272 suit of sables. O heavens! die two months ago, and not forgotten
5 3273 yet? Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life
5 3274 half a year: but, by'r lady, he must build churches then; or else
5 3275 shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose
5 3276 epitaph is 'For, O, for, O, the hobby-horse is forgot!'
5 3277 
5 3278 [Trumpets sound. The dumb show enters.]
5 3279 
5 3280 [Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing
5 3281 him and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation
5 3282 unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her
5 3283 neck: lays him down upon a bank of flowers: she, seeing
5 3284 him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his
5 3285 crown, kisses it, pours poison in the king's ears, and exit. The
5 3286 Queen returns, finds the King dead, and makes passionate action.
5 3287 The Poisoner with some three or four Mutes, comes in again,
5 3288 seeming to lament with her. The dead body is carried away. The
5 3289 Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts; she seems loth and unwilling
5 3290 awhile, but in the end accepts his love.]
5 3291 
5 3292 [Exeunt.]
5 3293 
5 3294 Oph.
5 3295 What means this, my lord?
5 3296 
5 3297 Ham.
5 3298 Marry, this is miching mallecho; it means mischief.
5 3299 
5 3300 Oph.
5 3301 Belike this show imports the argument of the play.
5 3302 
5 3303 [Enter Prologue.]
5 3304 
5 3305 Ham.
5 3306 We shall know by this fellow: the players cannot keep counsel;
5 3307 they'll tell all.
5 3308 
5 3309 Oph.
5 3310 Will he tell us what this show meant?
5 3311 
5 3312 Ham.
5 3313 Ay, or any show that you'll show him: be not you ashamed to
5 3314 show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.
5 3315 
5 3316 Oph.
5 3317 You are naught, you are naught: I'll mark the play.
5 3318 
5 3319 Pro.
5 3320    For us, and for our tragedy,
5 3321    Here stooping to your clemency,
5 3322    We beg your hearing patiently.
5 3323 
5 3324 Ham.
5 3325 Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
5 3326 
5 3327 Oph.
5 3328 'Tis brief, my lord.
5 3329 
5 3330 Ham.
5 3331 As woman's love.
5 3332 
5 3333 [Enter a King and a Queen.]
5 3334 
5 3335 P. King.
5 3336 Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
5 3337 Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
5 3338 And thirty dozen moons with borrow'd sheen
5 3339 About the world have times twelve thirties been,
5 3340 Since love our hearts, and Hymen did our hands,
5 3341 Unite commutual in most sacred bands.
5 3342 
5 3343 P. Queen.
5 3344 So many journeys may the sun and moon
5 3345 Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
5 3346 But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,
5 3347 So far from cheer and from your former state.
5 3348 That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
5 3349 Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:
5 3350 For women's fear and love holds quantity;
5 3351 In neither aught, or in extremity.
5 3352 Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know;
5 3353 And as my love is siz'd, my fear is so:
5 3354 Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
5 3355 Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
5 3356 
5 3357 P. King.
5 3358 Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
5 3359 My operant powers their functions leave to do:
5 3360 And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
5 3361 Honour'd, belov'd, and haply one as kind
5 3362 For husband shalt thou,--
5 3363 
5 3364 P. Queen.
5 3365 O, confound the rest!
5 3366 Such love must needs be treason in my breast:
5 3367 In second husband let me be accurst!
5 3368 None wed the second but who kill'd the first.
5 3369 
5 3370 Ham.
5 3371 [Aside.] Wormwood, wormwood!
5 3372 
5 3373 P. Queen.
5 3374 The instances that second marriage move
5 3375 Are base respects of thrift, but none of love.
5 3376 A second time I kill my husband dead
5 3377 When second husband kisses me in bed.
5 3378 
5 3379 P. King.
5 3380 I do believe you think what now you speak;
5 3381 But what we do determine oft we break.
5 3382 Purpose is but the slave to memory;
5 3383 Of violent birth, but poor validity:
5 3384 Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree;
5 3385 But fall unshaken when they mellow be.
5 3386 Most necessary 'tis that we forget
5 3387 To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:
5 3388 What to ourselves in passion we propose,
5 3389 The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
5 3390 The violence of either grief or joy
5 3391 Their own enactures with themselves destroy:
5 3392 Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
5 3393 Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
5 3394 This world is not for aye; nor 'tis not strange
5 3395 That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
5 3396 For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
5 3397 Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
5 3398 The great man down, you mark his favourite flies,
5 3399 The poor advanc'd makes friends of enemies;
5 3400 And hitherto doth love on fortune tend:
5 3401 For who not needs shall never lack a friend;
5 3402 And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
5 3403 Directly seasons him his enemy.
5 3404 But, orderly to end where I begun,--
5 3405 Our wills and fates do so contrary run
5 3406 That our devices still are overthrown;
5 3407 Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own:
5 3408 So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
5 3409 But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
5 3410 
5 3411 P. Queen.
5 3412 Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light!
5 3413 Sport and repose lock from me day and night!
5 3414 To desperation turn my trust and hope!
5 3415 An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope!
5 3416 Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
5 3417 Meet what I would have well, and it destroy!
5 3418 Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
5 3419 If, once a widow, ever I be wife!
5 3420 
5 3421 Ham.
5 3422 If she should break it now! [To Ophelia.]
5 3423 
5 3424 P. King.
5 3425 'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile;
5 3426 My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
5 3427 The tedious day with sleep.
5 3428 [Sleeps.]
5 3429 
5 3430 P. Queen.
5 3431 Sleep rock thy brain,
5 3432 And never come mischance between us twain!
5 3433 
5 3434 [Exit.]
5 3435 
5 3436 Ham.
5 3437 Madam, how like you this play?
5 3438 
5 3439 Queen.
5 3440 The lady protests too much, methinks.
5 3441 
5 3442 Ham.
5 3443 O, but she'll keep her word.
5 3444 
5 3445 King.
5 3446 Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in't?
5 3447 
5 3448 Ham.
5 3449 No, no! They do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i' the
5 3450 world.
5 3451 
5 3452 King.
5 3453 What do you call the play?
5 3454 
5 3455 Ham.
5 3456 The Mouse-trap. Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the
5 3457 image of a murder done in Vienna: Gonzago is the duke's name;
5 3458 his wife, Baptista: you shall see anon; 'tis a knavish piece of
5 3459 work: but what o' that? your majesty, and we that have free
5 3460 souls, it touches us not: let the gall'd jade wince; our withers
5 3461 are unwrung.
5 3462 
5 3463 [Enter Lucianus.]
5 3464 
5 3465 This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.
5 3466 
5 3467 Oph.
5 3468 You are a good chorus, my lord.
5 3469 
5 3470 Ham.
5 3471 I could interpret between you and your love, if I could see
5 3472 the puppets dallying.
5 3473 
5 3474 Oph.
5 3475 You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
5 3476 
5 3477 Ham.
5 3478 It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
5 3479 
5 3480 Oph.
5 3481 Still better, and worse.
5 3482 
5 3483 Ham.
5 3484 So you must take your husbands.--Begin, murderer; pox, leave
5 3485 thy damnable faces, and begin. Come:--'The croaking raven doth
5 3486 bellow for revenge.'
5 3487 
5 3488 Luc.
5 3489 Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
5 3490 Confederate season, else no creature seeing;
5 3491 Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
5 3492 With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
5 3493 Thy natural magic and dire property
5 3494 On wholesome life usurp immediately.
5 3495 
5 3496 [Pours the poison into the sleeper's ears.]
5 3497 
5 3498 Ham.
5 3499 He poisons him i' the garden for's estate. His name's Gonzago:
5 3500 The story is extant, and written in very choice Italian; you
5 3501 shall see anon how the murderer gets the love of Gonzago's wife.
5 3502 
5 3503 Oph.
5 3504 The King rises.
5 3505 
5 3506 Ham.
5 3507 What, frighted with false fire!
5 3508 
5 3509 Queen.
5 3510 How fares my lord?
5 3511 
5 3512 Pol.
5 3513 Give o'er the play.
5 3514 
5 3515 King.
5 3516 Give me some light:--away!
5 3517 
5 3518 All.
5 3519 Lights, lights, lights!
5 3520 
5 3521 [Exeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio.]
5 3522 
5 3523 Ham.
5 3524    Why, let the strucken deer go weep,
5 3525      The hart ungalled play;
5 3526    For some must watch, while some must sleep:
5 3527      So runs the world away.--
5 3528 Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers--if the rest of my
5 3529 fortunes turn Turk with me,--with two Provincial roses on my
5 3530 razed shoes, get me a fellowship in a cry of players, sir?
5 3531 
5 3532 Hor.
5 3533 Half a share.
5 3534 
5 3535 Ham.
5 3536      A whole one, I.
5 3537    For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
5 3538      This realm dismantled was
5 3539    Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
5 3540      A very, very--pajock.
5 3541 
5 3542 Hor.
5 3543 You might have rhymed.
5 3544 
5 3545 Ham.
5 3546 O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand
5 3547 pound! Didst perceive?
5 3548 
5 3549 Hor.
5 3550 Very well, my lord.
5 3551 
5 3552 Ham.
5 3553 Upon the talk of the poisoning?--
5 3554 
5 3555 Hor.
5 3556 I did very well note him.
5 3557 
5 3558 Ham.
5 3559 Ah, ha!--Come, some music! Come, the recorders!--
5 3560    For if the king like not the comedy,
5 3561    Why then, belike he likes it not, perdy.
5 3562 Come, some music!
5 3563 
5 3564 [Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
5 3565 
5 3566 Guil.
5 3567 Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
5 3568 
5 3569 Ham.
5 3570 Sir, a whole history.
5 3571 
5 3572 Guil.
5 3573 The king, sir--
5 3574 
5 3575 Ham.
5 3576 Ay, sir, what of him?
5 3577 
5 3578 Guil.
5 3579 Is, in his retirement, marvellous distempered.
5 3580 
5 3581 Ham.
5 3582 With drink, sir?
5 3583 
5 3584 Guil.
5 3585 No, my lord; rather with choler.
5 3586 
5 3587 Ham.
5 3588 Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to
5 3589 the doctor; for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps
5 3590 plunge him into far more choler.
5 3591 
5 3592 Guil.
5 3593 Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and start
5 3594 not so wildly from my affair.
5 3595 
5 3596 Ham.
5 3597 I am tame, sir:--pronounce.
5 3598 
5 3599 Guil.
5 3600 The queen, your mother, in most great affliction of spirit,
5 3601 hath sent me to you.
5 3602 
5 3603 Ham.
5 3604 You are welcome.
5 3605 
5 3606 Guil.
5 3607 Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right breed.
5 3608 If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will do
5 3609 your mother's commandment: if not, your pardon and my return
5 3610 shall be the end of my business.
5 3611 
5 3612 Ham.
5 3613 Sir, I cannot.
5 3614 
5 3615 Guil.
5 3616 What, my lord?
5 3617 
5 3618 Ham.
5 3619 Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased: but, sir, such
5 3620 answer as I can make, you shall command; or rather, as you say,
5 3621 my mother: therefore no more, but to the matter: my mother, you
5 3622 say,--
5 3623 
5 3624 Ros.
5 3625 Then thus she says: your behaviour hath struck her into
5 3626 amazement and admiration.
5 3627 
5 3628 Ham.
5 3629 O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother!--But is there no
5 3630 sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration?
5 3631 
5 3632 Ros.
5 3633 She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed.
5 3634 
5 3635 Ham.
5 3636 We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any
5 3637 further trade with us?
5 3638 
5 3639 Ros.
5 3640 My lord, you once did love me.
5 3641 
5 3642 Ham.
5 3643 And so I do still, by these pickers and stealers.
5 3644 
5 3645 Ros.
5 3646 Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? you do, surely,
5 3647 bar the door upon your own liberty if you deny your griefs to
5 3648 your friend.
5 3649 
5 3650 Ham.
5 3651 Sir, I lack advancement.
5 3652 
5 3653 Ros.
5 3654 How can that be, when you have the voice of the king himself
5 3655 for your succession in Denmark?
5 3656 
5 3657 Ham.
5 3658 Ay, sir, but 'While the grass grows'--the proverb is something
5 3659 musty.
5 3660 
5 3661 [Re-enter the Players, with recorders.]
5 3662 
5 3663 O, the recorders:--let me see one.--To withdraw with you:--why do
5 3664 you go about to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive me
5 3665 into a toil?
5 3666 
5 3667 Guil.
5 3668 O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too unmannerly.
5 3669 
5 3670 Ham.
5 3671 I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this pipe?
5 3672 
5 3673 Guil.
5 3674 My lord, I cannot.
5 3675 
5 3676 Ham.
5 3677 I pray you.
5 3678 
5 3679 Guil.
5 3680 Believe me, I cannot.
5 3681 
5 3682 Ham.
5 3683 I do beseech you.
5 3684 
5 3685 Guil.
5 3686 I know, no touch of it, my lord.
5 3687 
5 3688 Ham.
5 3689 'Tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages with your
5 3690 finger and thumb, give it breath with your mouth, and it will
5 3691 discourse most eloquent music. Look you, these are the stops.
5 3692 
5 3693 Guil.
5 3694 But these cannot I command to any utterance of harmony; I
5 3695 have not the skill.
5 3696 
5 3697 Ham.
5 3698 Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You
5 3699 would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you would
5 3700 pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my
5 3701 lowest note to the top of my compass; and there is much music,
5 3702 excellent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it
5 3703 speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am easier to be played on than a
5 3704 pipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret me,
5 3705 you cannot play upon me.
5 3706 
5 3707 [Enter Polonius.]
5 3708 
5 3709 God bless you, sir!
5 3710 
5 3711 Pol.
5 3712 My lord, the queen would speak with you, and presently.
5 3713 
5 3714 Ham.
5 3715 Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
5 3716 
5 3717 Pol.
5 3718 By the mass, and 'tis like a camel indeed.
5 3719 
5 3720 Ham.
5 3721 Methinks it is like a weasel.
5 3722 
5 3723 Pol.
5 3724 It is backed like a weasel.
5 3725 
5 3726 Ham.
5 3727 Or like a whale.
5 3728 
5 3729 Pol.
5 3730 Very like a whale.
5 3731 
5 3732 Ham.
5 3733 Then will I come to my mother by and by.--They fool me to the
5 3734 top of my bent.--I will come by and by.
5 3735 
5 3736 Pol.
5 3737 I will say so.
5 3738 
5 3739 [Exit.]
5 3740 
5 3741 Ham.
5 3742 By-and-by is easily said.
5 3743 
5 3744 [Exit Polonius.]
5 3745 
5 3746 --Leave me, friends.
5 3747 
5 3748 [Exeunt Ros, Guil., Hor., and Players.]
5 3749 
5 3750 'Tis now the very witching time of night,
5 3751 When churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes out
5 3752 Contagion to this world: now could I drink hot blood,
5 3753 And do such bitter business as the day
5 3754 Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother.--
5 3755 O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
5 3756 The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom:
5 3757 Let me be cruel, not unnatural;
5 3758 I will speak daggers to her, but use none;
5 3759 My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites,--
5 3760 How in my words somever she be shent,
5 3761 To give them seals never, my soul, consent!
5 3762

5 3767 Scene III. A room in the Castle.
5 3768 
5 3769 [Enter King, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.]
5 3770 
5 3771 King.
5 3772 I like him not; nor stands it safe with us
5 3773 To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
5 3774 I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
5 3775 And he to England shall along with you:
5 3776 The terms of our estate may not endure
5 3777 Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow
5 3778 Out of his lunacies.
5 3779 
5 3780 Guil.
5 3781 We will ourselves provide:
5 3782 Most holy and religious fear it is
5 3783 To keep those many many bodies safe
5 3784 That live and feed upon your majesty.
5 3785 
5 3786 Ros.
5 3787 The single and peculiar life is bound,
5 3788 With all the strength and armour of the mind,
5 3789 To keep itself from 'noyance; but much more
5 3790 That spirit upon whose weal depend and rest
5 3791 The lives of many. The cease of majesty
5 3792 Dies not alone; but like a gulf doth draw
5 3793 What's near it with it: it is a massy wheel,
5 3794 Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
5 3795 To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
5 3796 Are mortis'd and adjoin'd; which, when it falls,
5 3797 Each small annexment, petty consequence,
5 3798 Attends the boisterous ruin. Never alone
5 3799 Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
5 3800 
5 3801 King.
5 3802 Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;
5 3803 For we will fetters put upon this fear,
5 3804 Which now goes too free-footed.
5 3805 
5 3806 Ros and Guil.
5 3807 We will haste us.
5 3808 
5 3809 [Exeunt Ros. and Guil.]
5 3810 
5 3811 [Enter Polonius.]
5 3812 
5 3813 Pol.
5 3814 My lord, he's going to his mother's closet:
5 3815 Behind the arras I'll convey myself
5 3816 To hear the process; I'll warrant she'll tax him home:
5 3817 And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
5 3818 'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,
5 3819 Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
5 3820 The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege:
5 3821 I'll call upon you ere you go to bed,
5 3822 And tell you what I know.
5 3823 
5 3824 King.
5 3825 Thanks, dear my lord.
5 3826 
5 3827 [Exit Polonius.]
5 3828 
5 3829 O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;
5 3830 It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,--
5 3831 A brother's murder!--Pray can I not,
5 3832 Though inclination be as sharp as will:
5 3833 My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;
5 3834 And, like a man to double business bound,
5 3835 I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
5 3836 And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
5 3837 Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,--
5 3838 Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
5 3839 To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
5 3840 But to confront the visage of offence?
5 3841 And what's in prayer but this twofold force,--
5 3842 To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
5 3843 Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
5 3844 My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
5 3845 Can serve my turn? Forgive me my foul murder!--
5 3846 That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
5 3847 Of those effects for which I did the murder,--
5 3848 My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.
5 3849 May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?
5 3850 In the corrupted currents of this world
5 3851 Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice;
5 3852 And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
5 3853 Buys out the law; but 'tis not so above;
5 3854 There is no shuffling;--there the action lies
5 3855 In his true nature; and we ourselves compell'd,
5 3856 Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
5 3857 To give in evidence. What then? what rests?
5 3858 Try what repentance can: what can it not?
5 3859 Yet what can it when one cannot repent?
5 3860 O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
5 3861 O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
5 3862 Art more engag'd! Help, angels! Make assay:
5 3863 Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart, with strings of steel,
5 3864 Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe!
5 3865 All may be well.
5 3866 
5 3867 [Retires and kneels.]
5 3868 
5 3869 [Enter Hamlet.]
5 3870 
5 3871 Ham.
5 3872 Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
5 3873 And now I'll do't;--and so he goes to heaven;
5 3874 And so am I reveng'd.--that would be scann'd:
5 3875 A villain kills my father; and for that,
5 3876 I, his sole son, do this same villain send
5 3877 To heaven.
5 3878 O, this is hire and salary, not revenge.
5 3879 He took my father grossly, full of bread;
5 3880 With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
5 3881 And how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?
5 3882 But in our circumstance and course of thought,
5 3883 'Tis heavy with him: and am I, then, reveng'd,
5 3884 To take him in the purging of his soul,
5 3885 When he is fit and season'd for his passage?
5 3886 No.
5 3887 Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent:
5 3888 When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage;
5 3889 Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed;
5 3890 At gaming, swearing; or about some act
5 3891 That has no relish of salvation in't;--
5 3892 Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven;
5 3893 And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
5 3894 As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays:
5 3895 This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.
5 3896 
5 3897 [Exit.]
5 3898 
5 3899 [The King rises and advances.]
5 3900

5 3902 My words fly up, my thoughts remain below:

5 3910 
5 3911 [Enter Queen and Polonius.]
5 3912 
5 3913 Pol.
5 3914 He will come straight. Look you lay home to him:
5 3915 Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
5 3916 And that your grace hath screen'd and stood between
5 3917 Much heat and him. I'll silence me e'en here.
5 3918 Pray you, be round with him.
5 3919 
5 3920 Ham.
5 3921 [Within.] Mother, mother, mother!
5 3922 
5 3923 Queen.
5 3924 I'll warrant you:
5 3925 Fear me not:--withdraw; I hear him coming.
5 3926 
5 3927 [Polonius goes behind the arras.]
5 3928 
5 3929 [Enter Hamlet.]
5 3930 
5 3931 Ham.
5 3932 Now, mother, what's the matter?
5 3933 
5 3934 Queen.
5 3935 Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
5 3936 
5 3937 Ham.
5 3938 Mother, you have my father much offended.
5 3939 
5 3940 Queen.
5 3941 Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
5 3942 
5 3943 Ham.
5 3944 Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
5 3945 
5 3946 Queen.
5 3947 Why, how now, Hamlet!
5 3948 
5 3949 Ham.
5 3950 What's the matter now?
5 3951 
5 3952 Queen.
5 3953 Have you forgot me?
5 3954 
5 3955 Ham.
5 3956 No, by the rood, not so:
5 3957 You are the Queen, your husband's brother's wife,
5 3958 And,--would it were not so!--you are my mother.
5 3959 
5 3960 Queen.
5 3961 Nay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak.
5 3962 
5 3963 Ham.
5 3964 Come, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge;
5 3965 You go not till I set you up a glass
5 3966 Where you may see the inmost part of you.
5 3967 
5 3968 Queen.
5 3969 What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murder me?--
5 3970 Help, help, ho!
5 3971 
5 3972 Pol.
5 3973 [Behind.] What, ho! help, help, help!
5 3974 
5 3975 Ham.
5 3976 How now? a rat? [Draws.]
5 3977 Dead for a ducat, dead!
5 3978 
5 3979 [Makes a pass through the arras.]
5 3980 
5 3981 Pol.
5 3982 [Behind.] O, I am slain!
5 3983 
5 3984 [Falls and dies.]
5 3985 
5 3986 Queen.
5 3987 O me, what hast thou done?
5 3988 
5 3989 Ham.
5 3990 Nay, I know not: is it the king?
5 3991 
5 3992 [Draws forth Polonius.]
5 3993 
5 3994 Queen.
5 3995 O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
5 3996 
5 3997 Ham.
5 3998 A bloody deed!--almost as bad, good mother,
5 3999 As kill a king and marry with his brother.
5 4000 
5 4001 Queen.
5 4002 As kill a king!
5 4003 
5 4004 Ham.
5 4005 Ay, lady, 'twas my word.--
5 4006 Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
5 4007 [To Polonius.]
5 4008 I took thee for thy better: take thy fortune;
5 4009 Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.--
5 4010 Leave wringing of your hands: peace! sit you down,
5 4011 And let me wring your heart: for so I shall,
5 4012 If it be made of penetrable stuff;
5 4013 If damned custom have not braz'd it so
5 4014 That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
5 4015 
5 4016 Queen.
5 4017 What have I done, that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
5 4018 In noise so rude against me?
5 4019 
5 4020 Ham.
5 4021 Such an act
5 4022 That blurs the grace and blush of modesty;
5 4023 Calls virtue hypocrite; takes off the rose
5 4024 From the fair forehead of an innocent love,
5 4025 And sets a blister there; makes marriage-vows
5 4026 As false as dicers' oaths: O, such a deed
5 4027 As from the body of contraction plucks
5 4028 The very soul, and sweet religion makes
5 4029 A rhapsody of words: heaven's face doth glow;
5 4030 Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
5 4031 With tristful visage, as against the doom,
5 4032 Is thought-sick at the act.
5 4033 
5 4034 Queen.
5 4035 Ah me, what act,
5 4036 That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?
5 4037 
5 4038 Ham.
5 4039 Look here upon this picture, and on this,--
5 4040 The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
5 4041 See what a grace was seated on this brow;
5 4042 Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
5 4043 An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
5 4044 A station like the herald Mercury
5 4045 New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:
5 4046 A combination and a form, indeed,
5 4047 Where every god did seem to set his seal,
5 4048 To give the world assurance of a man;
5 4049 This was your husband.--Look you now what follows:
5 4050 Here is your husband, like a milldew'd ear
5 4051 Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
5 4052 Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
5 4053 And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?
5 4054 You cannot call it love; for at your age
5 4055 The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,
5 4056 And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment
5 4057 Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,
5 4058 Else could you not have motion: but sure that sense
5 4059 Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err;
5 4060 Nor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thrall'd
5 4061 But it reserv'd some quantity of choice
5 4062 To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
5 4063 That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
5 4064 Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
5 4065 Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
5 4066 Or but a sickly part of one true sense
5 4067 Could not so mope.
5 4068 O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
5 4069 If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
5 4070 To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,
5 4071 And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame
5 4072 When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
5 4073 Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
5 4074 And reason panders will.
5 4075 
5 4076 Queen.
5 4077 O Hamlet, speak no more:
5 4078 Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul;
5 4079 And there I see such black and grained spots
5 4080 As will not leave their tinct.
5 4081 
5 4082 Ham.
5 4083 Nay, but to live
5 4084 In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
5 4085 Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
5 4086 Over the nasty sty,--
5 4087 
5 4088 Queen.
5 4089 O, speak to me no more;
5 4090 These words like daggers enter in mine ears;
5 4091 No more, sweet Hamlet.
5 4092 
5 4093 Ham.
5 4094 A murderer and a villain;
5 4095 A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
5 4096 Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
5 4097 A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
5 4098 That from a shelf the precious diadem stole
5 4099 And put it in his pocket!
5 4100 
5 4101 Queen.
5 4102 No more.
5 4103 
5 4104 Ham.
5 4105 A king of shreds and patches!--
5 4106 
5 4107 [Enter Ghost.]
5 4108 
5 4109 Save me and hover o'er me with your wings,
5 4110 You heavenly guards!--What would your gracious figure?
5 4111 
5 4112 Queen.
5 4113 Alas, he's mad!
5 4114 
5 4115 Ham.
5 4116 Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
5 4117 That, laps'd in time and passion, lets go by
5 4118 The important acting of your dread command?
5 4119 O, say!
5 4120 
5 4121 Ghost.
5 4122 Do not forget. This visitation
5 4123 Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
5 4124 But, look, amazement on thy mother sits:
5 4125 O, step between her and her fighting soul,--
5 4126 Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works,--
5 4127 Speak to her, Hamlet.
5 4128 
5 4129 Ham.
5 4130 How is it with you, lady?
5 4131 
5 4132 Queen.
5 4133 Alas, how is't with you,
5 4134 That you do bend your eye on vacancy,
5 4135 And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?
5 4136 Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
5 4137 And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,
5 4138 Your bedded hairs, like life in excrements,
5 4139 Start up and stand an end. O gentle son,
5 4140 Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
5 4141 Sprinkle cool patience! Whereon do you look?
5 4142 
5 4143 Ham.
5 4144 On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
5 4145 His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
5 4146 Would make them capable.--Do not look upon me;
5 4147 Lest with this piteous action you convert
5 4148 My stern effects: then what I have to do
5 4149 Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.
5 4150 
5 4151 Queen.
5 4152 To whom do you speak this?
5 4153 
5 4154 Ham.
5 4155 Do you see nothing there?
5 4156 
5 4157 Queen.
5 4158 Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
5 4159 
5 4160 Ham.
5 4161 Nor did you nothing hear?
5 4162 
5 4163 Queen.
5 4164 No, nothing but ourselves.
5 4165 
5 4166 Ham.
5 4167 Why, look you there! look how it steals away!
5 4168 My father, in his habit as he liv'd!
5 4169 Look, where he goes, even now out at the portal!
5 4170 
5 4171 [Exit Ghost.]
5 4172 
5 4173 Queen.
5 4174 This is the very coinage of your brain:
5 4175 This bodiless creation ecstasy
5 4176 Is very cunning in.
5 4177 
5 4178 Ham.
5 4179 Ecstasy!
5 4180 My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,
5 4181 And makes as healthful music: it is not madness
5 4182 That I have utter'd: bring me to the test,
5 4183 And I the matter will re-word; which madness
5 4184 Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
5 4185 Lay not that flattering unction to your soul
5 4186 That not your trespass, but my madness speaks:
5 4187 It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
5 4188 Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,
5 4189 Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
5 4190 Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
5 4191 And do not spread the compost on the weeds,
5 4192 To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
5 4193 For in the fatness of these pursy times
5 4194 Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,
5 4195 Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
5 4196 
5 4197 Queen.
5 4198 O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
5 4199 
5 4200 Ham.
5 4201 O, throw away the worser part of it,
5 4202 And live the purer with the other half.
5 4203 Good night: but go not to mine uncle's bed;
5 4204 Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
5 4205 That monster custom, who all sense doth eat,
5 4206 Of habits evil, is angel yet in this,--
5 4207 That to the use of actions fair and good
5 4208 He likewise gives a frock or livery
5 4209 That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night;
5 4210 And that shall lend a kind of easiness
5 4211 To the next abstinence: the next more easy;
5 4212 For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
5 4213 And either curb the devil, or throw him out
5 4214 With wondrous potency. Once more, good-night:
5 4215 And when you are desirous to be bles'd,
5 4216 I'll blessing beg of you.--For this same lord
5 4217 [Pointing to Polonius.]
5 4218 I do repent; but heaven hath pleas'd it so,
5 4219 To punish me with this, and this with me,
5 4220 That I must be their scourge and minister.
5 4221 I will bestow him, and will answer well
5 4222 The death I gave him. So again, good-night.--
5 4223 I must be cruel, only to be kind:
5 4224 Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.--
5 4225 One word more, good lady.
5 4226 
5 4227 Queen.
5 4228 What shall I do?
5 4229 
5 4230 Ham.
5 4231 Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
5 4232 Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed;
5 4233 Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
5 4234 And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
5 4235 Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
5 4236 Make you to ravel all this matter out,
5 4237 That I essentially am not in madness,
5 4238 But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
5 4239 For who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
5 4240 Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,
5 4241 Such dear concernings hide? who would do so?
5 4242 No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
5 4243 Unpeg the basket on the house's top,
5 4244 Let the birds fly, and, like the famous ape,
5 4245 To try conclusions, in the basket creep
5 4246 And break your own neck down.
5 4247 
5 4248 Queen.
5 4249 Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,
5 4250 And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
5 4251 What thou hast said to me.
5 4252 
5 4253 Ham.
5 4254 I must to England; you know that?
5 4255 
5 4256 Queen.
5 4257 Alack,
5 4258 I had forgot: 'tis so concluded on.
5 4259 
5 4260 Ham.
5 4261 There's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows,--
5 4262 Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,--
5 4263 They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way
5 4264 And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
5 4265 For 'tis the sport to have the enginer
5 4266 Hoist with his own petard: and 't shall go hard
5 4267 But I will delve one yard below their mines
5 4268 And blow them at the moon: O, 'tis most sweet,
5 4269 When in one line two crafts directly meet.--
5 4270 This man shall set me packing:
5 4271 I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.--
5 4272 Mother, good-night.--Indeed, this counsellor
5 4273 Is now most still, most secret, and most grave,
5 4274 Who was in life a foolish peating knave.
5 4275 Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you:--
5 4276 Good night, mother.
5 4277 
5 4278 [Exeunt severally; Hamlet, dragging out Polonius.]

5 4282 ACT IV.
5 4283 
5 4284 Scene I. A room in the Castle.
5 4285 
5 4286 [Enter King, Queen, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
5 4287 
5 4288 King.
5 4289 There's matter in these sighs. These profound heaves
5 4290 You must translate: 'tis fit we understand them.
5 4291 Where is your son?
5 4292 
5 4293 Queen.
5 4294 Bestow this place on us a little while.
5 4295 
5 4296 [To Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, who go out.]
5 4297 
5 4298 Ah, my good lord, what have I seen to-night!
5 4299 
5 4300 King.
5 4301 What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
5 4302 
5 4303 Queen.
5 4304 Mad as the sea and wind, when both contend
5 4305 Which is the mightier: in his lawless fit
5 4306 Behind the arras hearing something stir,
5 4307 Whips out his rapier, cries 'A rat, a rat!'
5 4308 And in this brainish apprehension, kills
5 4309 The unseen good old man.
5 4310 
5 4311 King.
5 4312 O heavy deed!
5 4313 It had been so with us, had we been there:
5 4314 His liberty is full of threats to all;
5 4315 To you yourself, to us, to every one.
5 4316 Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
5 4317 It will be laid to us, whose providence
5 4318 Should have kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt
5 4319 This mad young man. But so much was our love
5 4320 We would not understand what was most fit;
5 4321 But, like the owner of a foul disease,
5 4322 To keep it from divulging, let it feed
5 4323 Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?
5 4324 
5 4325 Queen.
5 4326 To draw apart the body he hath kill'd:
5 4327 O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
5 4328 Among a mineral of metals base,
5 4329 Shows itself pure: he weeps for what is done.
5 4330 
5 4331 King.
5 4332 O Gertrude, come away!
5 4333 The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
5 4334 But we will ship him hence: and this vile deed
5 4335 We must with all our majesty and skill
5 4336 Both countenance and excuse.--Ho, Guildenstern!
5 4337 
5 4338 [Re-enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
5 4339 
5 4340 Friends both, go join you with some further aid:
5 4341 Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
5 4342 And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him:
5 4343 Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
5 4344 Into the chapel. I pray you, haste in this.
5 4345 
5 4346 [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
5 4347 
5 4348 Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends;
5 4349 And let them know both what we mean to do
5 4350 And what's untimely done: so haply slander,--
5 4351 Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter,
5 4352 As level as the cannon to his blank,
5 4353 Transports his poison'd shot,--may miss our name,
5 4354 And hit the woundless air.--O, come away!
5 4355 My soul is full of discord and dismay.
5 4356 
5 4357 [Exeunt.]
5 4358 
5 4359 Scene II. Another room in the Castle.
5 4360 
5 4361 [Enter Hamlet.]
5 4362 
5 4363 Ham.
5 4364 Safely stowed.
5 4365 
5 4366 Ros. and Guil.
5 4367 [Within.] Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
5 4368 
5 4369 Ham.
5 4370 What noise? who calls on Hamlet? O, here they come.
5 4371 
5 4372 [Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
5 4373 
5 4374 Ros.
5 4375 What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
5 4376 
5 4377 Ham.
5 4378 Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
5 4379 
5 4380 Ros.
5 4381 Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence,
5 4382 And bear it to the chapel.
5 4383 
5 4384 Ham.
5 4385 Do not believe it.
5 4386 
5 4387 Ros.
5 4388 Believe what?
5 4389 
5 4390 Ham.
5 4391 That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides, to be
5 4392 demanded of a sponge!--what replication should be made by the son
5 4393 of a king?
5 4394 
5 4395 Ros.
5 4396 Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
5 4397 
5 4398 Ham.
5 4399 Ay, sir; that soaks up the King's countenance, his rewards,
5 4400 his authorities. But such officers do the king best service in
5 4401 the end: he keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his jaw;
5 4402 first mouthed, to be last swallowed: when he needs what you have
5 4403 gleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you shall be dry
5 4404 again.
5 4405 
5 4406 Ros.
5 4407 I understand you not, my lord.
5 4408 
5 4409 Ham.
5 4410 I am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
5 4411 
5 4412 Ros.
5 4413 My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us to
5 4414 the king.
5 4415 
5 4416 Ham.
5 4417 The body is with the king, but the king is not with the body.
5 4418 The king is a thing,--
5 4419 
5 4420 Guil.
5 4421 A thing, my lord!
5 4422 
5 4423 Ham.
5 4424 Of nothing: bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
5 4425 
5 4426 [Exeunt.]

5 4430 Scene III. Another room in the Castle.
5 4431 
5 4432 [Enter King,attended.]
5 4433 
5 4434 King.
5 4435 I have sent to seek him and to find the body.
5 4436 How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
5 4437 Yet must not we put the strong law on him:
5 4438 He's lov'd of the distracted multitude,
5 4439 Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
5 4440 And where 'tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd,
5 4441 But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
5 4442 This sudden sending him away must seem
5 4443 Deliberate pause: diseases desperate grown
5 4444 By desperate appliance are reliev'd,
5 4445 Or not at all.
5 4446 
5 4447 [Enter Rosencrantz.]
5 4448 
5 4449 How now! what hath befall'n?
5 4450 
5 4451 Ros.
5 4452 Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
5 4453 We cannot get from him.
5 4454 
5 4455 King.
5 4456 But where is he?
5 4457 
5 4458 Ros.
5 4459 Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
5 4460 
5 4461 King.
5 4462 Bring him before us.
5 4463 
5 4464 Ros.
5 4465 Ho, Guildenstern! bring in my lord.
5 4466 
5 4467 [Enter Hamlet and Guildenstern.]
5 4468 
5 4469 King.
5 4470 Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
5 4471 
5 4472 Ham.
5 4473 At supper.
5 4474 
5 4475 King.
5 4476 At supper! where?
5 4477 
5 4478 Ham.
5 4479 Not where he eats, but where he is eaten: a certain
5 4480 convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your worm is your
5 4481 only emperor for diet: we fat all creatures else to fat us, and
5 4482 we fat ourselves for maggots: your fat king and your lean beggar
5 4483 is but variable service,--two dishes, but to one table: that's
5 4484 the end.
5 4485 
5 4486 King.
5 4487 Alas, alas!
5 4488 
5 4489 Ham.
5 4490 A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat
5 4491 of the fish that hath fed of that worm.
5 4492 
5 4493 King.
5 4494 What dost thou mean by this?
5 4495 
5 4496 Ham.
5 4497 Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through
5 4498 the guts of a beggar.
5 4499 
5 4500 King.
5 4501 Where is Polonius?
5 4502 
5 4503 Ham.
5 4504 In heaven: send thither to see: if your messenger find him not
5 4505 there, seek him i' the other place yourself. But, indeed, if you
5 4506 find him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go up
5 4507 the stairs into the lobby.
5 4508 
5 4509 King.
5 4510 Go seek him there. [To some Attendants.]
5 4511 
5 4512 Ham.
5 4513 He will stay till you come.
5 4514 
5 4515 [Exeunt Attendants.]
5 4516 
5 4517 King.
5 4518 Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,--
5 4519 Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve
5 4520 For that which thou hast done,--must send thee hence
5 4521 With fiery quickness: therefore prepare thyself;
5 4522 The bark is ready, and the wind at help,
5 4523 The associates tend, and everything is bent
5 4524 For England.
5 4525 
5 4526 Ham.
5 4527 For England!
5 4528 
5 4529 King.
5 4530 Ay, Hamlet.
5 4531 
5 4532 Ham.
5 4533 Good.
5 4534 
5 4535 King.
5 4536 So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
5 4537 
5 4538 Ham.
5 4539 I see a cherub that sees them.--But, come; for England!--
5 4540 Farewell, dear mother.
5 4541 
5 4542 King.
5 4543 Thy loving father, Hamlet.
5 4544 
5 4545 Ham.
5 4546 My mother: father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is
5 4547 one flesh; and so, my mother.--Come, for England!
5 4548 
5 4549 [Exit.]
5 4550 
5 4551 King.
5 4552 Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard;
5 4553 Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night:
5 4554 Away! for everything is seal'd and done
5 4555 That else leans on the affair: pray you, make haste.
5 4556 
5 4557 [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
5 4558 
5 4559 And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,--
5 4560 As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
5 4561 Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
5 4562 After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
5 4563 Pays homage to us,--thou mayst not coldly set
5 4564 Our sovereign process; which imports at full,
5 4565 By letters conjuring to that effect,
5 4566 The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
5 4567 For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
5 4568 And thou must cure me: till I know 'tis done,
5 4569 Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.

5 4578 
5 4579 For.
5 4580 Go, Captain, from me greet the Danish king:
5 4581 Tell him that, by his license, Fortinbras
5 4582 Craves the conveyance of a promis'd march
5 4583 Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
5 4584 If that his majesty would aught with us,
5 4585 We shall express our duty in his eye;
5 4586 And let him know so.
5 4587 
5 4588 Capt.
5 4589 I will do't, my lord.
5 4590 
5 4591 For.
5 4592 Go softly on.
5 4593 
5 4594 [Exeunt all For. and Forces.]
5 4595 
5 4596 [Enter Hamlet, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, &c.]
5 4597 
5 4598 Ham.
5 4599 Good sir, whose powers are these?
5 4600 
5 4601 Capt.
5 4602 They are of Norway, sir.
5 4603 
5 4604 Ham.
5 4605 How purpos'd, sir, I pray you?
5 4606 
5 4607 Capt.
5 4608 Against some part of Poland.
5 4609 
5 4610 Ham.
5 4611 Who commands them, sir?
5 4612 
5 4613 Capt.
5 4614 The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.
5 4615 
5 4616 Ham.
5 4617 Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
5 4618 Or for some frontier?
5 4619 
5 4620 Capt.
5 4621 Truly to speak, and with no addition,
5 4622 We go to gain a little patch of ground
5 4623 That hath in it no profit but the name.
5 4624 To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
5 4625 Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
5 4626 A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
5 4627 
5 4628 Ham.
5 4629 Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
5 4630 
5 4631 Capt.
5 4632 Yes, it is already garrison'd.
5 4633 
5 4634 Ham.
5 4635 Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
5 4636 Will not debate the question of this straw:
5 4637 This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace,
5 4638 That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
5 4639 Why the man dies.--I humbly thank you, sir.
5 4640 
5 4641 Capt.
5 4642 God b' wi' you, sir.
5 4643 
5 4644 [Exit.]
5 4645 
5 4646 Ros.
5 4647 Will't please you go, my lord?
5 4648 
5 4649 Ham.
5 4650 I'll be with you straight. Go a little before.
5 4651 
5 4652 [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]
5 4653 
5 4654 How all occasions do inform against me
5 4655 And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
5 4656 If his chief good and market of his time
5 4657 Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.
5 4658 Sure he that made us with such large discourse,
5 4659 Looking before and after, gave us not
5 4660 That capability and godlike reason
5 4661 To fust in us unus'd. Now, whether it be
5 4662 Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
5 4663 Of thinking too precisely on the event,--
5 4664 A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
5 4665 And ever three parts coward,--I do not know
5 4666 Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;'
5 4667 Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means
5 4668 To do't. Examples, gross as earth, exhort me:
5 4669 Witness this army, of such mass and charge,
5 4670 Led by a delicate and tender prince;
5 4671 Whose spirit, with divine ambition puff'd,
5 4672 Makes mouths at the invisible event;
5 4673 Exposing what is mortal and unsure
5 4674 To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,
5 4675 Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great
5 4676 Is not to stir without great argument,
5 4677 But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
5 4678 When honour's at the stake. How stand I, then,
5 4679 That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
5 4680 Excitements of my reason and my blood,
5 4681 And let all sleep? while, to my shame, I see
5 4682 The imminent death of twenty thousand men
5 4683 That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,
5 4684 Go to their graves like beds; fight for a plot
5 4685 Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
5 4686 Which is not tomb enough and continent
5 4687 To hide the slain?--O, from this time forth,
5 4688 My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!

5 4697 
5 4698 Queen.
5 4699 I will not speak with her.
5 4700 
5 4701 Gent.
5 4702 She is importunate; indeed distract:
5 4703 Her mood will needs be pitied.
5 4704 
5 4705 Queen.
5 4706 What would she have?
5 4707 
5 4708 Gent.
5 4709 She speaks much of her father; says she hears
5 4710 There's tricks i' the world, and hems, and beats her heart;
5 4711 Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
5 4712 That carry but half sense: her speech is nothing,
5 4713 Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
5 4714 The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
5 4715 And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
5 4716 Which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures yield them,
5 4717 Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
5 4718 Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
5 4719 'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew
5 4720 Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
5 4721 
5 4722 Queen.
5 4723 Let her come in.
5 4724 
5 4725 [Exit Horatio.]
5 4726 
5 4727 To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is,
5 4728 Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss:
5 4729 So full of artless jealousy is guilt,
5 4730 It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.
5 4731 
5 4732 [Re-enter Horatio with Ophelia.]
5 4733 
5 4734 Oph.
5 4735 Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?
5 4736 
5 4737 Queen.
5 4738 How now, Ophelia?
5 4739 
5 4740 Oph. [Sings.]
5 4741    How should I your true love know
5 4742      From another one?
5 4743    By his cockle bat and' staff
5 4744      And his sandal shoon.
5 4745 
5 4746 Queen.
5 4747 Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
5 4748 
5 4749 Oph.
5 4750 Say you? nay, pray you, mark.
5 4751 [Sings.]
5 4752    He is dead and gone, lady,
5 4753      He is dead and gone;
5 4754    At his head a grass green turf,
5 4755      At his heels a stone.
5 4756 
5 4757 Queen.
5 4758 Nay, but Ophelia--
5 4759 
5 4760 Oph.
5 4761 Pray you, mark.
5 4762 [Sings.]
5 4763    White his shroud as the mountain snow,
5 4764 
5 4765 [Enter King.]
5 4766 
5 4767 Queen.
5 4768 Alas, look here, my lord!
5 4769 
5 4770 Oph.
5 4771 [Sings.]
5 4772      Larded all with sweet flowers;
5 4773    Which bewept to the grave did go
5 4774      With true-love showers.
5 4775 
5 4776 King.
5 4777 How do you, pretty lady?
5 4778 
5 4779 Oph.
5 4780 Well, God dild you! They say the owl was a baker's daughter.
5 4781 Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be. God be at
5 4782 your table!
5 4783 
5 4784 King.
5 4785 Conceit upon her father.
5 4786 
5 4787 Oph.
5 4788 Pray you, let's have no words of this; but when they ask you what
5 4789 it means, say you this:
5 4790 [Sings.]
5 4791    To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day
5 4792      All in the morning bedtime,
5 4793    And I a maid at your window,
5 4794      To be your Valentine.
5 4795 
5 4796    Then up he rose and donn'd his clothes,
5 4797      And dupp'd the chamber door,
5 4798    Let in the maid, that out a maid
5 4799      Never departed more.
5 4800 
5 4801 King.
5 4802 Pretty Ophelia!
5 4803 
5 4804 Oph.
5 4805 Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't:
5 4806 [Sings.]
5 4807    By Gis and by Saint Charity,
5 4808      Alack, and fie for shame!
5 4809    Young men will do't if they come to't;
5 4810      By cock, they are to blame.
5 4811 
5 4812    Quoth she, before you tumbled me,
5 4813      You promis'd me to wed.
5 4814    So would I ha' done, by yonder sun,
5 4815      An thou hadst not come to my bed.
5 4816 
5 4817 King.
5 4818 How long hath she been thus?
5 4819 
5 4820 Oph.
5 4821 I hope all will be well. We must be patient: but I cannot
5 4822 choose but weep, to think they would lay him i' the cold ground.
5 4823 My brother shall know of it: and so I thank you for your good
5 4824 counsel.--Come, my coach!--Good night, ladies; good night, sweet
5 4825 ladies; good night, good night.
5 4826 
5 4827 [Exit.]
5 4828 
5 4829 King.
5 4830 Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.
5 4831 
5 4832 [Exit Horatio.]
5 4833 
5 4834 O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
5 4835 All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
5 4836 When sorrows come, they come not single spies,
5 4837 But in battalions! First, her father slain:
5 4838 Next, your son gone; and he most violent author
5 4839 Of his own just remove: the people muddied,
5 4840 Thick and and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers
5 4841 For good Polonius' death; and we have done but greenly
5 4842 In hugger-mugger to inter him: poor Ophelia
5 4843 Divided from herself and her fair judgment,
5 4844 Without the which we are pictures or mere beasts:
5 4845 Last, and as much containing as all these,
5 4846 Her brother is in secret come from France;
5 4847 Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,
5 4848 And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
5 4849 With pestilent speeches of his father's death;
5 4850 Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
5 4851 Will nothing stick our person to arraign
5 4852 In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
5 4853 Like to a murdering piece, in many places
5 4854 Give, me superfluous death.
5 4855 
5 4856 [A noise within.]
5 4857 
5 4858 Queen.
5 4859 Alack, what noise is this?
5 4860 
5 4861 King.
5 4862 Where are my Switzers? let them guard the door.
5 4863 
5 4864 [Enter a Gentleman.]
5 4865 
5 4866 What is the matter?
5 4867 
5 4868 Gent.
5 4869 Save yourself, my lord:
5 4870 The ocean, overpeering of his list,
5 4871 Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
5 4872 Than young Laertes, in a riotous head,
5 4873 O'erbears your offices. The rabble call him lord;
5 4874 And, as the world were now but to begin,
5 4875 Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
5 4876 The ratifiers and props of every word,
5 4877 They cry 'Choose we! Laertes shall be king!'
5 4878 Caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds,
5 4879 'Laertes shall be king! Laertes king!'
5 4880 
5 4881 Queen.
5 4882 How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
5 4883 O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
5 4884 
5 4885 [A noise within.]
5 4886 
5 4887 King.
5 4888 The doors are broke.
5 4889 
5 4890 [Enter Laertes, armed; Danes following.]
5 4891 
5 4892 Laer.
5 4893 Where is this king?--Sirs, stand you all without.
5 4894 
5 4895 Danes.
5 4896 No, let's come in.
5 4897 
5 4898 Laer.
5 4899 I pray you, give me leave.
5 4900 
5 4901 Danes.
5 4902 We will, we will.
5 4903 
5 4904 [They retire without the door.]
5 4905 
5 4906 Laer.
5 4907 I thank you:--keep the door.--O thou vile king,
5 4908 Give me my father!
5 4909 
5 4910 Queen.
5 4911 Calmly, good Laertes.
5 4912 
5 4913 Laer.
5 4914 That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;
5 4915 Cries cuckold to my father; brands the harlot
5 4916 Even here, between the chaste unsmirched brow
5 4917 Of my true mother.
5 4918 
5 4919 King.
5 4920 What is the cause, Laertes,
5 4921 That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?--
5 4922 Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person:
5 4923 There's such divinity doth hedge a king,
5 4924 That treason can but peep to what it would,
5 4925 Acts little of his will.--Tell me, Laertes,
5 4926 Why thou art thus incens'd.--Let him go, Gertrude:--
5 4927 Speak, man.
5 4928 
5 4929 Laer.
5 4930 Where is my father?
5 4931 
5 4932 King.
5 4933 Dead.
5 4934 
5 4935 Queen.
5 4936 But not by him.
5 4937 
5 4938 King.
5 4939 Let him demand his fill.
5 4940 
5 4941 Laer.
5 4942 How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
5 4943 To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil!
5 4944 Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
5 4945 I dare damnation:--to this point I stand,--
5 4946 That both the worlds, I give to negligence,
5 4947 Let come what comes; only I'll be reveng'd
5 4948 Most throughly for my father.
5 4949 
5 4950 King.
5 4951 Who shall stay you?
5 4952 
5 4953 Laer.
5 4954 My will, not all the world:
5 4955 And for my means, I'll husband them so well,
5 4956 They shall go far with little.
5 4957 
5 4958 King.
5 4959 Good Laertes,
5 4960 If you desire to know the certainty
5 4961 Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge
5 4962 That, sweepstake, you will draw both friend and foe,
5 4963 Winner and loser?
5 4964 
5 4965 Laer.
5 4966 None but his enemies.
5 4967 
5 4968 King.
5 4969 Will you know them then?
5 4970 
5 4971 Laer.
5 4972 To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;
5 4973 And, like the kind life-rendering pelican,
5 4974 Repast them with my blood.
5 4975 
5 4976 King.
5 4977 Why, now you speak
5 4978 Like a good child and a true gentleman.
5 4979 That I am guiltless of your father's death,
5 4980 And am most sensibly in grief for it,
5 4981 It shall as level to your judgment pierce
5 4982 As day does to your eye.
5 4983 
5 4984 Danes.
5 4985 [Within] Let her come in.
5 4986 
5 4987 Laer.
5 4988 How now! What noise is that?
5 4989 
5 4990 [Re-enter Ophelia, fantastically dressed with straws and
5 4991 flowers.]
5 4992 
5 4993 O heat, dry up my brains! tears seven times salt,
5 4994 Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!--
5 4995 By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight,
5 4996 Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
5 4997 Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!--
5 4998 O heavens! is't possible a young maid's wits
5 4999 Should be as mortal as an old man's life?
5 5000 Nature is fine in love; and where 'tis fine,
5 5001 It sends some precious instance of itself
5 5002 After the thing it loves.
5 5003 
5 5004 Oph.
5 5005 [Sings.]
5 5006    They bore him barefac'd on the bier
5 5007    Hey no nonny, nonny, hey nonny
5 5008    And on his grave rain'd many a tear.--
5 5009 
5 5010 Fare you well, my dove!
5 5011 
5 5012 Laer.
5 5013 Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
5 5014 It could not move thus.
5 5015 
5 5016 Oph.
5 5017 You must sing 'Down a-down, an you call him a-down-a.' O,
5 5018 how the wheel becomes it! It is the false steward, that stole his
5 5019 master's daughter.
5 5020 
5 5021 Laer.
5 5022 This nothing's more than matter.
5 5023 
5 5024 Oph.
5 5025 There's rosemary, that's for remembrance; pray, love,
5 5026 remember: and there is pansies, that's for thoughts.
5 5027 
5 5028 Laer.
5 5029 A document in madness,--thoughts and remembrance fitted.
5 5030 
5 5031 Oph.
5 5032 There's fennel for you, and columbines:--there's rue for you;
5 5033 and here's some for me:--we may call it herb of grace o'
5 5034 Sundays:--O, you must wear your rue with a difference.--There's a
5 5035 daisy:--I would give you some violets, but they wither'd all when
5 5036 my father died:--they say he made a good end,--
5 5037 [Sings.]
5 5038    For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy,--
5 5039 
5 5040 Laer.
5 5041 Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
5 5042 She turns to favour and to prettiness.
5 5043 
5 5044 Oph.
5 5045 [Sings.]
5 5046    And will he not come again?
5 5047    And will he not come again?
5 5048      No, no, he is dead,
5 5049      Go to thy death-bed,
5 5050    He never will come again.
5 5051 
5 5052    His beard was as white as snow,
5 5053    All flaxen was his poll:
5 5054      He is gone, he is gone,
5 5055      And we cast away moan:
5 5056    God ha' mercy on his soul!
5 5057 
5 5058 And of all Christian souls, I pray God.--God b' wi' ye.
5 5059 
5 5060 [Exit.]
5 5061 
5 5062 Laer.
5 5063 Do you see this, O God?
5 5064 
5 5065 King.
5 5066 Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
5 5067 Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
5 5068 Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will,
5 5069 And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me.
5 5070 If by direct or by collateral hand
5 5071 They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
5 5072 Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours,
5 5073 To you in satisfaction; but if not,
5 5074 Be you content to lend your patience to us,
5 5075 And we shall jointly labour with your soul
5 5076 To give it due content.
5 5077 
5 5078 Laer.
5 5079 Let this be so;
5 5080 His means of death, his obscure burial,--
5 5081 No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
5 5082 No noble rite nor formal ostentation,--
5 5083 Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
5 5084 That I must call't in question.
5 5085 
5 5086 King.
5 5087 So you shall;
5 5088 And where the offence is let the great axe fall.
5 5089 I pray you go with me.

5 5098 
5 5099 Hor.
5 5100 What are they that would speak with me?
5 5101 
5 5102 Servant.
5 5103 Sailors, sir: they say they have letters for you.
5 5104 
5 5105 Hor.
5 5106 Let them come in.
5 5107 
5 5108 [Exit Servant.]
5 5109 
5 5110 I do not know from what part of the world
5 5111 I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.
5 5112 
5 5113 [Enter Sailors.]
5 5114 
5 5115 I Sailor.
5 5116 God bless you, sir.
5 5117 
5 5118 Hor.
5 5119 Let him bless thee too.
5 5120 
5 5121 Sailor.
5 5122 He shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for you,
5 5123 sir,--it comes from the ambassador that was bound for England; if
5 5124 your name be Horatio, as I am let to know it is.
5 5125 
5 5126 Hor.
5 5127 [Reads.] 'Horatio, when thou shalt have overlooked
5 5128 this, give these fellows some means to the king: they have
5 5129 letters for him. Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of
5 5130 very warlike appointment gave us chase. Finding ourselves too
5 5131 slow of sail, we put on a compelled valour, and in the grapple I
5 5132 boarded them: on the instant they got clear of our ship; so I
5 5133 alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like thieves
5 5134 of mercy: but they knew what they did; I am to do a good turn for
5 5135 them. Let the king have the letters I have sent; and repair thou
5 5136 to me with as much haste as thou wouldst fly death. I have words
5 5137 to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much too
5 5138 light for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will bring
5 5139 thee where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their course
5 5140 for England: of them I have much to tell thee. Farewell.
5 5141 He that thou knowest thine,       HAMLET.'
5 5142 
5 5143 Come, I will give you way for these your letters;
5 5144 And do't the speedier, that you may direct me
5 5145 To him from whom you brought them.
5 5146 
5 5147 [Exeunt.]

5 5149

5 5151 Scene VII. Another room in the Castle.
5 5152 
5 5153 [Enter King and Laertes.]
5 5154 
5 5155 King.
5 5156 Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
5 5157 And you must put me in your heart for friend,
5 5158 Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
5 5159 That he which hath your noble father slain
5 5160 Pursu'd my life.
5 5161 
5 5162 Laer.
5 5163 It well appears:--but tell me
5 5164 Why you proceeded not against these feats,
5 5165 So crimeful and so capital in nature,
5 5166 As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
5 5167 You mainly were stirr'd up.
5 5168 
5 5169 King.
5 5170 O, for two special reasons;
5 5171 Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
5 5172 But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother
5 5173 Lives almost by his looks; and for myself,--
5 5174 My virtue or my plague, be it either which,--
5 5175 She's so conjunctive to my life and soul,
5 5176 That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
5 5177 I could not but by her. The other motive,
5 5178 Why to a public count I might not go,
5 5179 Is the great love the general gender bear him;
5 5180 Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
5 5181 Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
5 5182 Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,
5 5183 Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
5 5184 Would have reverted to my bow again,
5 5185 And not where I had aim'd them.
5 5186 
5 5187 Laer.
5 5188 And so have I a noble father lost;
5 5189 A sister driven into desperate terms,--
5 5190 Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
5 5191 Stood challenger on mount of all the age
5 5192 For her perfections:--but my revenge will come.
5 5193 
5 5194 King.
5 5195 Break not your sleeps for that:--you must not think
5 5196 That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
5 5197 That we can let our beard be shook with danger,
5 5198 And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:
5 5199 I lov'd your father, and we love ourself;
5 5200 And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine,--
5 5201 
5 5202 [Enter a Messenger.]
5 5203 
5 5204 How now! What news?
5 5205 
5 5206 Mess.
5 5207 Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
5 5208 This to your majesty; this to the queen.
5 5209 
5 5210 King.
5 5211 From Hamlet! Who brought them?
5 5212 
5 5213 Mess.
5 5214 Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not:
5 5215 They were given me by Claudio:--he receiv'd them
5 5216 Of him that brought them.
5 5217 
5 5218 King.
5 5219 Laertes, you shall hear them.
5 5220 Leave us.

5 5223 
5 5224 [Reads]'High and mighty,--You shall know I am set naked on your
5 5225 kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes:
5 5226 when I shall, first asking your pardon thereunto, recount the
5 5227 occasions of my sudden and more strange return.       HAMLET.'
5 5228 
5 5229 What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
5 5230 Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
5 5231 
5 5232 Laer.
5 5233 Know you the hand?
5 5234 
5 5235 King.
5 5236 'Tis Hamlet's character:--'Naked!'--
5 5237 And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
5 5238 Can you advise me?
5 5239 
5 5240 Laer.
5 5241 I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come;
5 5242 It warms the very sickness in my heart
5 5243 That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
5 5244 'Thus didest thou.'
5 5245 
5 5246 King.
5 5247 If it be so, Laertes,--
5 5248 As how should it be so? how otherwise?--
5 5249 Will you be rul'd by me?
5 5250 
5 5251 Laer.
5 5252 Ay, my lord;
5 5253 So you will not o'errule me to a peace.
5 5254 
5 5255 King.
5 5256 To thine own peace. If he be now return'd--
5 5257 As checking at his voyage, and that he means
5 5258 No more to undertake it,--I will work him
5 5259 To exploit, now ripe in my device,
5 5260 Under the which he shall not choose but fall:
5 5261 And for his death no wind shall breathe;
5 5262 But even his mother shall uncharge the practice
5 5263 And call it accident.
5 5264 
5 5265 Laer.
5 5266 My lord, I will be rul'd;
5 5267 The rather if you could devise it so
5 5268 That I might be the organ.
5 5269 
5 5270 King.
5 5271 It falls right.
5 5272 You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
5 5273 And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
5 5274 Wherein they say you shine: your sum of parts
5 5275 Did not together pluck such envy from him
5 5276 As did that one; and that, in my regard,
5 5277 Of the unworthiest siege.
5 5278 
5 5279 Laer.
5 5280 What part is that, my lord?
5 5281 
5 5282 King.
5 5283 A very riband in the cap of youth,
5 5284 Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes
5 5285 The light and careless livery that it wears
5 5286 Than settled age his sables and his weeds,
5 5287 Importing health and graveness.--Two months since,
5 5288 Here was a gentleman of Normandy,--
5 5289 I've seen myself, and serv'd against, the French,
5 5290 And they can well on horseback: but this gallant
5 5291 Had witchcraft in't: he grew unto his seat;
5 5292 And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,
5 5293 As had he been incorps'd and demi-natur'd
5 5294 With the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought
5 5295 That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
5 5296 Come short of what he did.
5 5297 
5 5298 Laer.
5 5299 A Norman was't?
5 5300 
5 5301 King.
5 5302 A Norman.
5 5303 
5 5304 Laer.
5 5305 Upon my life, Lamond.
5 5306 
5 5307 King.
5 5308 The very same.
5 5309 
5 5310 Laer.
5 5311 I know him well: he is the brooch indeed
5 5312 And gem of all the nation.
5 5313 
5 5314 King.
5 5315 He made confession of you;
5 5316 And gave you such a masterly report
5 5317 For art and exercise in your defence,
5 5318 And for your rapier most especially,
5 5319 That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed
5 5320 If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation
5 5321 He swore, had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
5 5322 If you oppos'd them. Sir, this report of his
5 5323 Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
5 5324 That he could nothing do but wish and beg
5 5325 Your sudden coming o'er, to play with him.
5 5326 Now, out of this,--
5 5327 
5 5328 Laer.
5 5329 What out of this, my lord?
5 5330 
5 5331 King.
5 5332 Laertes, was your father dear to you?
5 5333 Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
5 5334 A face without a heart?
5 5335 
5 5336 Laer.
5 5337 Why ask you this?
5 5338 
5 5339 King.
5 5340 Not that I think you did not love your father;
5 5341 But that I know love is begun by time,
5 5342 And that I see, in passages of proof,
5 5343 Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
5 5344 There lives within the very flame of love
5 5345 A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
5 5346 And nothing is at a like goodness still;
5 5347 For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
5 5348 Dies in his own too much: that we would do,
5 5349 We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes,
5 5350 And hath abatements and delays as many
5 5351 As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
5 5352 And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
5 5353 That hurts by easing. But to the quick o' the ulcer:--
5 5354 Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake
5 5355 To show yourself your father's son in deed
5 5356 More than in words?
5 5357 
5 5358 Laer.
5 5359 To cut his throat i' the church.
5 5360 
5 5361 King.
5 5362 No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;
5 5363 Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
5 5364 Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.
5 5365 Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:
5 5366 We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
5 5367 And set a double varnish on the fame
5 5368 The Frenchman gave you; bring you in fine together
5 5369 And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,
5 5370 Most generous, and free from all contriving,
5 5371 Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease,
5 5372 Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
5 5373 A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,
5 5374 Requite him for your father.
5 5375 
5 5376 Laer.
5 5377 I will do't:
5 5378 And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.
5 5379 I bought an unction of a mountebank,
5 5380 So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
5 5381 Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
5 5382 Collected from all simples that have virtue
5 5383 Under the moon, can save the thing from death
5 5384 This is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point
5 5385 With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
5 5386 It may be death.
5 5387 
5 5388 King.
5 5389 Let's further think of this;
5 5390 Weigh what convenience both of time and means
5 5391 May fit us to our shape: if this should fail,
5 5392 And that our drift look through our bad performance.
5 5393 'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this project
5 5394 Should have a back or second, that might hold
5 5395 If this did blast in proof. Soft! let me see:--
5 5396 We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings,--
5 5397 I ha't:
5 5398 When in your motion you are hot and dry,--
5 5399 As make your bouts more violent to that end,--
5 5400 And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepar'd him
5 5401 A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
5 5402 If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
5 5403 Our purpose may hold there.
5 5404 
5 5405 [Enter Queen.]
5 5406 
5 5407 How now, sweet queen!
5 5408 
5 5409 Queen.
5 5410 One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
5 5411 So fast they follow:--your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
5 5412 
5 5413 Laer.
5 5414 Drown'd! O, where?
5 5415 
5 5416 Queen.
5 5417 There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
5 5418 That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;
5 5419 There with fantastic garlands did she come
5 5420 Of crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,
5 5421 That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
5 5422 But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them.
5 5423 There, on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds
5 5424 Clamb'ring to hang, an envious sliver broke;
5 5425 When down her weedy trophies and herself
5 5426 Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;
5 5427 And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up;
5 5428 Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes;
5 5429 As one incapable of her own distress,
5 5430 Or like a creature native and indu'd
5 5431 Unto that element: but long it could not be
5 5432 Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
5 5433 Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
5 5434 To muddy death.
5 5435 
5 5436 Laer.
5 5437 Alas, then she is drown'd?
5 5438 
5 5439 Queen.
5 5440 Drown'd, drown'd.
5 5441 
5 5442 Laer.
5 5443 Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
5 5444 And therefore I forbid my tears: but yet
5 5445 It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
5 5446 Let shame say what it will: when these are gone,
5 5447 The woman will be out.--Adieu, my lord:
5 5448 I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,
5 5449 But that this folly douts it.
5 5450 
5 5451 [Exit.]
5 5452 
5 5453 King.
5 5454 Let's follow, Gertrude;
5 5455 How much I had to do to calm his rage!
5 5456 Now fear I this will give it start again;
5 5457 Therefore let's follow.
5 5458 
5 5459 [Exeunt.]
5 5460 
5 5461 
5 5462 
5 5463 ACT V.
5 5464 
5 5465 Scene I. A churchyard.
5 5466 
5 5467 [Enter two Clowns, with spades, &c.]
5 5468 
5 5469 1 Clown.
5 5470 Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she wilfully
5 5471 seeks her own salvation?
5 5472 
5 5473 2 Clown.
5 5474 I tell thee she is; and therefore make her grave straight: the
5 5475 crowner hath sat on her, and finds it Christian burial.
5 5476 
5 5477 1 Clown.
5 5478 How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her own defence?
5 5479 
5 5480 2 Clown.
5 5481 Why, 'tis found so.
5 5482 
5 5483 1 Clown.
5 5484 It must be se offendendo; it cannot be else. For here lies
5 5485 the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act: and an
5 5486 act hath three branches; it is to act, to do, and to perform:
5 5487 argal, she drowned herself wittingly.
5 5488 
5 5489 2 Clown.
5 5490 Nay, but hear you, goodman delver,--
5 5491 
5 5492 1 Clown.
5 5493 Give me leave. Here lies the water; good: here stands the
5 5494 man; good: if the man go to this water and drown himself, it is,
5 5495 will he, nill he, he goes,--mark you that: but if the water come
5 5496 to him and drown him, he drowns not himself; argal, he that is
5 5497 not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.
5 5498 
5 5499 2 Clown.
5 5500 But is this law?
5 5501 
5 5502 1 Clown.
5 5503 Ay, marry, is't--crowner's quest law.
5 5504 
5 5505 2 Clown.
5 5506 Will you ha' the truth on't? If this had not been a
5 5507 gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o' Christian burial.
5 5508 
5 5509 1 Clown.
5 5510 Why, there thou say'st: and the more pity that great folk
5 5511 should have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves
5 5512 more than their even Christian.--Come, my spade. There is no
5 5513 ancient gentlemen but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers: they
5 5514 hold up Adam's profession.
5 5515 
5 5516 2 Clown.
5 5517 Was he a gentleman?
5 5518 
5 5519 1 Clown.
5 5520 He was the first that ever bore arms.
5 5521 
5 5522 2 Clown.
5 5523 Why, he had none.
5 5524 
5 5525 1 Clown.
5 5526 What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the Scripture?
5 5527 The Scripture says Adam digg'd: could he dig without arms? I'll
5 5528 put another question to thee: if thou answerest me not to the
5 5529 purpose, confess thyself,--
5 5530 
5 5531 2 Clown.
5 5532 Go to.
5 5533 
5 5534 1 Clown.
5 5535 What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the
5 5536 shipwright, or the carpenter?
5 5537 
5 5538 2 Clown.
5 5539 The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand tenants.
5 5540 
5 5541 1 Clown.
5 5542 I like thy wit well, in good faith: the gallows does well;
5 5543 but how does it well? it does well to those that do ill: now,
5 5544 thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the
5 5545 church; argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come.
5 5546 
5 5547 2 Clown.
5 5548 Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a carpenter?
5 5549 
5 5550 1 Clown.
5 5551 Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
5 5552 
5 5553 2 Clown.
5 5554 Marry, now I can tell.
5 5555 
5 5556 1 Clown.
5 5557 To't.
5 5558 
5 5559 2 Clown.
5 5560 Mass, I cannot tell.
5 5561 
5 5562 [Enter Hamlet and Horatio, at a distance.]
5 5563 
5 5564 1 Clown.
5 5565 Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass will
5 5566 not mend his pace with beating; and when you are asked this
5 5567 question next, say 'a grave-maker;' the houses he makes last
5 5568 till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan; fetch me a stoup of
5 5569 liquor.
5 5570 
5 5571 [Exit Second Clown.]
5 5572 
5 5573 [Digs and sings.]
5 5574 
5 5575    In youth when I did love, did love,
5 5576      Methought it was very sweet;
5 5577    To contract, O, the time for, ah, my behove,
5 5578      O, methought there was nothing meet.
5 5579 
5 5580 Ham.
5 5581 Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings at
5 5582 grave-making?
5 5583 
5 5584 Hor.
5 5585 Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.
5 5586 
5 5587 Ham.
5 5588 'Tis e'en so: the hand of little employment hath the daintier
5 5589 sense.
5 5590 
5 5591 1 Clown.
5 5592 [Sings.]
5 5593    But age, with his stealing steps,
5 5594      Hath claw'd me in his clutch,
5 5595    And hath shipp'd me into the land,
5 5596      As if I had never been such.
5 5597 
5 5598 [Throws up a skull.]
5 5599 
5 5600 Ham.
5 5601 That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once: how the
5 5602 knave jowls it to the ground,as if 'twere Cain's jawbone, that
5 5603 did the first murder! This might be the pate of a politician,
5 5604 which this ass now o'erreaches; one that would circumvent God,
5 5605 might it not?
5 5606 
5 5607 Hor.
5 5608 It might, my lord.
5 5609 
5 5610 Ham.
5 5611 Or of a courtier, which could say 'Good morrow, sweet lord!
5 5612 How dost thou, good lord?' This might be my lord such-a-one, that
5 5613 praised my lord such-a-one's horse when he meant to beg
5 5614 it,--might it not?
5 5615 
5 5616 Hor.
5 5617 Ay, my lord.
5 5618 
5 5619 Ham.
5 5620 Why, e'en so: and now my Lady Worm's; chapless, and knocked
5 5621 about the mazard with a sexton's spade: here's fine revolution,
5 5622 an we had the trick to see't. Did these bones cost no more the
5 5623 breeding but to play at loggets with 'em? mine ache to think
5 5624 on't.
5 5625 
5 5626 1 Clown.
5 5627 [Sings.]
5 5628    A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
5 5629      For and a shrouding sheet;
5 5630    O, a pit of clay for to be made
5 5631      For such a guest is meet.
5 5632 
5 5633 [Throws up another skull].
5 5634 
5 5635 Ham.
5 5636 There's another: why may not that be the skull of a lawyer?
5 5637 Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures,
5 5638 and his tricks? why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock
5 5639 him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him
5 5640 of his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be in's time a
5 5641 great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances, his
5 5642 fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries: is this the fine of
5 5643 his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine
5 5644 pate full of fine dirt? will his vouchers vouch him no more of
5 5645 his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and breadth
5 5646 of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his lands will
5 5647 scarcely lie in this box; and must the inheritor himself have no
5 5648 more, ha?
5 5649 
5 5650 Hor.
5 5651 Not a jot more, my lord.
5 5652 
5 5653 Ham.
5 5654 Is not parchment made of sheep-skins?
5 5655 
5 5656 Hor.
5 5657 Ay, my lord, And of calf-skins too.
5 5658 
5 5659 Ham.
5 5660 They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that. I
5 5661 will speak to this fellow.--Whose grave's this, sir?
5 5662 
5 5663 1 Clown.
5 5664 Mine, sir.
5 5665 [Sings.]
5 5666    O, a pit of clay for to be made
5 5667      For such a guest is meet.
5 5668 
5 5669 Ham.
5 5670 I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't.
5 5671 
5 5672 1 Clown.
5 5673 You lie out on't, sir, and therefore 'tis not yours: for my part,
5 5674 I do not lie in't, yet it is mine.
5 5675 
5 5676 Ham.
5 5677 Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine: 'tis for
5 5678 the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.
5 5679 
5 5680 1 Clown.
5 5681 'Tis a quick lie, sir; 't will away again from me to you.
5 5682 
5 5683 Ham.
5 5684 What man dost thou dig it for?
5 5685 
5 5686 1 Clown.
5 5687 For no man, sir.
5 5688 
5 5689 Ham.
5 5690 What woman then?
5 5691 
5 5692 1 Clown.
5 5693 For none neither.
5 5694 
5 5695 Ham.
5 5696 Who is to be buried in't?
5 5697 
5 5698 1 Clown.
5 5699 One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.
5 5700 
5 5701 Ham.
5 5702 How absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or
5 5703 equivocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, these three
5 5704 years I have taken note of it, the age is grown so picked that
5 5705 the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he
5 5706 galls his kibe.--How long hast thou been a grave-maker?
5 5707 
5 5708 1 Clown.
5 5709 Of all the days i' the year, I came to't that day that our
5 5710 last King Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
5 5711 
5 5712 Ham.
5 5713 How long is that since?
5 5714 
5 5715 1 Clown.
5 5716 Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: it was the
5 5717 very day that young Hamlet was born,--he that is mad, and sent
5 5718 into England.
5 5719 
5 5720 Ham.
5 5721 Ay, marry, why was be sent into England?
5 5722 
5 5723 1 Clown.
5 5724 Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits there;
5 5725 or, if he do not, it's no great matter there.
5 5726 
5 5727 Ham.
5 5728 Why?
5 5729 
5 5730 1 Clown.
5 5731 'Twill not he seen in him there; there the men are as mad as he.
5 5732 
5 5733 Ham.
5 5734 How came he mad?
5 5735 
5 5736 1 Clown.
5 5737 Very strangely, they say.
5 5738 
5 5739 Ham.
5 5740 How strangely?
5 5741 
5 5742 1 Clown.
5 5743 Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
5 5744 
5 5745 Ham.
5 5746 Upon what ground?
5 5747 
5 5748 1 Clown.
5 5749 Why, here in Denmark: I have been sexton here, man and boy,
5 5750 thirty years.
5 5751 
5 5752 Ham.
5 5753 How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?
5 5754 
5 5755 1 Clown.
5 5756 Faith, if he be not rotten before he die,--as we have many
5 5757 pocky corses now-a-days that will scarce hold the laying in,--he
5 5758 will last you some eight year or nine year: a tanner will last
5 5759 you nine year.
5 5760 
5 5761 Ham.
5 5762 Why he more than another?
5 5763 
5 5764 1 Clown.
5 5765 Why, sir, his hide is so tann'd with his trade that he will
5 5766 keep out water a great while; and your water is a sore decayer of
5 5767 your whoreson dead body. Here's a skull now; this skull hath lain
5 5768 in the earth three-and-twenty years.
5 5769 
5 5770 Ham.
5 5771 Whose was it?
5 5772 
5 5773 1 Clown.
5 5774 A whoreson, mad fellow's it was: whose do you think it was?
5 5775 
5 5776 Ham.
5 5777 Nay, I know not.
5 5778 
5 5779 1 Clown.
5 5780 A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! 'a pour'd a flagon of
5 5781 Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick's
5 5782 skull, the king's jester.
5 5783 
5 5784 Ham.
5 5785 This?
5 5786 
5 5787 1 Clown.
5 5788 E'en that.
5 5789 
5 5790 Ham.
5 5791 Let me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick!--I knew him,
5 5792 Horatio; a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he
5 5793 hath borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how abhorred
5 5794 in my imagination it is! my gorge rises at it. Here hung those
5 5795 lips that I have kiss'd I know not how oft. Where be your gibes
5 5796 now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment, that
5 5797 were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock your
5 5798 own grinning? quite chap-fallen? Now, get you to my lady's
5 5799 chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this
5 5800 favour she must come; make her laugh at that.--Pr'ythee, Horatio,
5 5801 tell me one thing.
5 5802 
5 5803 Hor.
5 5804 What's that, my lord?
5 5805 
5 5806 Ham.
5 5807 Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i' the earth?
5 5808 
5 5809 Hor.
5 5810 E'en so.
5 5811 
5 5812 Ham.
5 5813 And smelt so? Pah!
5 5814 
5 5815 [Throws down the skull.]
5 5816 
5 5817 Hor.
5 5818 E'en so, my lord.
5 5819 
5 5820 Ham.
5 5821 To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not
5 5822 imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it
5 5823 stopping a bung-hole?
5 5824 
5 5825 Hor.
5 5826 'Twere to consider too curiously to consider so.
5 5827 
5 5828 Ham.
5 5829 No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with modesty
5 5830 enough, and likelihood to lead it: as thus: Alexander died,
5 5831 Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is
5 5832 earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam whereto he
5 5833 was converted might they not stop a beer-barrel?
5 5834    Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
5 5835    Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.
5 5836    O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
5 5837    Should patch a wall to expel the winter's flaw!
5 5838 But soft! but soft! aside!--Here comes the king.
5 5839 
5 5840 [Enter priests, &c, in procession; the corpse of Ophelia,
5 5841 Laertes, and Mourners following; King, Queen, their Trains, &c.]
5 5842 
5 5843 The queen, the courtiers: who is that they follow?
5 5844 And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
5 5845 The corse they follow did with desperate hand
5 5846 Fordo it own life: 'twas of some estate.
5 5847 Couch we awhile and mark.
5 5848 
5 5849 [Retiring with Horatio.]
5 5850 
5 5851 Laer.
5 5852 What ceremony else?
5 5853 
5 5854 Ham.
5 5855 That is Laertes,
5 5856 A very noble youth: mark.
5 5857 
5 5858 Laer.
5 5859 What ceremony else?
5 5860 
5 5861 1 Priest.
5 5862 Her obsequies have been as far enlarg'd
5 5863 As we have warranties: her death was doubtful;
5 5864 And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
5 5865 She should in ground unsanctified have lodg'd
5 5866 Till the last trumpet; for charitable prayers,
5 5867 Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her,
5 5868 Yet here she is allowed her virgin rites,
5 5869 Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home
5 5870 Of bell and burial.
5 5871 
5 5872 Laer.
5 5873 Must there no more be done?
5 5874 
5 5875 1 Priest.
5 5876 No more be done;
5 5877 We should profane the service of the dead
5 5878 To sing a requiem and such rest to her
5 5879 As to peace-parted souls.
5 5880 
5 5881 Laer.
5 5882 Lay her i' the earth;--
5 5883 And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
5 5884 May violets spring!--I tell thee, churlish priest,
5 5885 A ministering angel shall my sister be
5 5886 When thou liest howling.
5 5887 
5 5888 Ham.
5 5889 What, the fair Ophelia?
5 5890 
5 5891 Queen.
5 5892 Sweets to the sweet: farewell.
5 5893 [Scattering flowers.]
5 5894 I hop'd thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
5 5895 I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
5 5896 And not have strew'd thy grave.
5 5897 
5 5898 Laer.
5 5899 O, treble woe
5 5900 Fall ten times treble on that cursed head
5 5901 Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
5 5902 Depriv'd thee of!--Hold off the earth awhile,
5 5903 Till I have caught her once more in mine arms:
5 5904 [Leaps into the grave.]
5 5905 Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,
5 5906 Till of this flat a mountain you have made,
5 5907 To o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head
5 5908 Of blue Olympus.
5 5909 
5 5910 Ham.
5 5911 [Advancing.]
5 5912 What is he whose grief
5 5913 Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
5 5914 Conjures the wandering stars, and makes them stand
5 5915 Like wonder-wounded hearers? this is I,
5 5916 Hamlet the Dane.
5 5917 [Leaps into the grave.]
5 5918 
5 5919 Laer.
5 5920 The devil take thy soul!
5 5921 [Grappling with him.]
5 5922 
5 5923 Ham.
5 5924 Thou pray'st not well.
5 5925 I pr'ythee, take thy fingers from my throat;
5 5926 For, though I am not splenetive and rash,
5 5927 Yet have I in me something dangerous,
5 5928 Which let thy wiseness fear: away thy hand!
5 5929 
5 5930 King.
5 5931 Pluck them asunder.
5 5932 
5 5933 Queen.
5 5934 Hamlet! Hamlet!
5 5935 
5 5936 All.
5 5937 Gentlemen!--
5 5938 
5 5939 Hor.
5 5940 Good my lord, be quiet.
5 5941 
5 5942 [The Attendants part them, and they come out of the grave.]
5 5943 
5 5944 Ham.
5 5945 Why, I will fight with him upon this theme
5 5946 Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
5 5947 
5 5948 Queen.
5 5949 O my son, what theme?
5 5950 
5 5951 Ham.
5 5952 I lov'd Ophelia; forty thousand brothers
5 5953 Could not, with all their quantity of love,
5 5954 Make up my sum.--What wilt thou do for her?
5 5955 
5 5956 King.
5 5957 O, he is mad, Laertes.
5 5958 
5 5959 Queen.
5 5960 For love of God, forbear him!
5 5961 
5 5962 Ham.
5 5963 'Swounds, show me what thou'lt do:
5 5964 Woul't weep? woul't fight? woul't fast? woul't tear thyself?
5 5965 Woul't drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?
5 5966 I'll do't.--Dost thou come here to whine?
5 5967 To outface me with leaping in her grave?
5 5968 Be buried quick with her, and so will I:
5 5969 And, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
5 5970 Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
5 5971 Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
5 5972 Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
5 5973 I'll rant as well as thou.
5 5974 
5 5975 Queen.
5 5976 This is mere madness:
5 5977 And thus a while the fit will work on him;
5 5978 Anon, as patient as the female dove,
5 5979 When that her golden couplets are disclos'd,
5 5980 His silence will sit drooping.
5 5981 
5 5982 Ham.
5 5983 Hear you, sir;
5 5984 What is the reason that you use me thus?
5 5985 I lov'd you ever: but it is no matter;
5 5986 Let Hercules himself do what he may,
5 5987 The cat will mew, and dog will have his day.
5 5988 
5 5989 [Exit.]
5 5990 
5 5991 King.
5 5992 I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.--
5 5993 
5 5994 [Exit Horatio.]
5 5995 [To Laertes]
5 5996 Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech;
5 5997 We'll put the matter to the present push.--
5 5998 Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.--
5 5999 This grave shall have a living monument:
5 6000 An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
5 6001 Till then in patience our proceeding be.
5 6002 
5 6003 [Exeunt.]
5 6004 
5 6005 
5 6006 
5 6007 Scene II. A hall in the Castle.
5 6008 
5 6009 [Enter Hamlet and Horatio.]
5 6010 
5 6011 Ham.
5 6012 So much for this, sir: now let me see the other;
5 6013 You do remember all the circumstance?
5 6014 
5 6015 Hor.
5 6016 Remember it, my lord!
5 6017 
5 6018 Ham.
5 6019 Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting
5 6020 That would not let me sleep: methought I lay
5 6021 Worse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly,
5 6022 And prais'd be rashness for it,--let us know,
5 6023 Our indiscretion sometime serves us well,
5 6024 When our deep plots do fail; and that should teach us
5 6025 There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
5 6026 Rough-hew them how we will.
5 6027 
5 6028 Hor.
5 6029 That is most certain.
5 6030 
5 6031 Ham.
5 6032 Up from my cabin,
5 6033 My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
5 6034 Grop'd I to find out them: had my desire;
5 6035 Finger'd their packet; and, in fine, withdrew
5 6036 To mine own room again: making so bold,
5 6037 My fears forgetting manners, to unseal
5 6038 Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,
5 6039 O royal knavery! an exact command,--
5 6040 Larded with many several sorts of reasons,
5 6041 Importing Denmark's health, and England's too,
5 6042 With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,--
5 6043 That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
5 6044 No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,
5 6045 My head should be struck off.
5 6046 
5 6047 Hor.
5 6048 Is't possible?
5 6049 
5 6050 Ham.
5 6051 Here's the commission: read it at more leisure.
5 6052 But wilt thou bear me how I did proceed?
5 6053 
5 6054 Hor.
5 6055 I beseech you.
5 6056 
5 6057 Ham.
5 6058 Being thus benetted round with villanies,--
5 6059 Or I could make a prologue to my brains,
5 6060 They had begun the play,--I sat me down;
5 6061 Devis'd a new commission; wrote it fair:
5 6062 I once did hold it, as our statists do,
5 6063 A baseness to write fair, and labour'd much
5 6064 How to forget that learning; but, sir, now
5 6065 It did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know
5 6066 The effect of what I wrote?
5 6067 
5 6068 Hor.
5 6069 Ay, good my lord.
5 6070 
5 6071 Ham.
5 6072 An earnest conjuration from the king,--
5 6073 As England was his faithful tributary;
5 6074 As love between them like the palm might flourish;
5 6075 As peace should still her wheaten garland wear
5 6076 And stand a comma 'tween their amities;
5 6077 And many such-like as's of great charge,--
5 6078 That, on the view and know of these contents,
5 6079 Without debatement further, more or less,
5 6080 He should the bearers put to sudden death,
5 6081 Not shriving-time allow'd.
5 6082 
5 6083 Hor.
5 6084 How was this seal'd?
5 6085 
5 6086 Ham.
5 6087 Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
5 6088 I had my father's signet in my purse,
5 6089 Which was the model of that Danish seal:
5 6090 Folded the writ up in the form of the other;
5 6091 Subscrib'd it: gave't the impression; plac'd it safely,
5 6092 The changeling never known. Now, the next day
5 6093 Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
5 6094 Thou know'st already.
5 6095 
5 6096 Hor.
5 6097 So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
5 6098 
5 6099 Ham.
5 6100 Why, man, they did make love to this employment;
5 6101 They are not near my conscience; their defeat
5 6102 Does by their own insinuation grow:
5 6103 'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
5 6104 Between the pass and fell incensed points
5 6105 Of mighty opposites.
5 6106 
5 6107 Hor.
5 6108 Why, what a king is this!
5 6109 
5 6110 Ham.
5 6111 Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon,--
5 6112 He that hath kill'd my king, and whor'd my mother;
5 6113 Popp'd in between the election and my hopes;
5 6114 Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
5 6115 And with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience
5 6116 To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd
5 6117 To let this canker of our nature come
5 6118 In further evil?
5 6119 
5 6120 Hor.
5 6121 It must be shortly known to him from England
5 6122 What is the issue of the business there.
5 6123 
5 6124 Ham.
5 6125 It will be short: the interim is mine;
5 6126 And a man's life is no more than to say One.
5 6127 But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
5 6128 That to Laertes I forgot myself;
5 6129 For by the image of my cause I see
5 6130 The portraiture of his: I'll court his favours:
5 6131 But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me
5 6132 Into a towering passion.
5 6133 
5 6134 Hor.
5 6135 Peace; who comes here?
5 6136 
5 6137 [Enter Osric.]
5 6138 
5 6139 Osr.
5 6140 Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
5 6141 
5 6142 Ham.
5 6143 I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?
5 6144 
5 6145 Hor.
5 6146 No, my good lord.
5 6147 
5 6148 Ham.
5 6149 Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to know him. He
5 6150 hath much land, and fertile: let a beast be lord of beasts, and
5 6151 his crib shall stand at the king's mess; 'tis a chough; but, as I
5 6152 say, spacious in the possession of dirt.
5 6153 
5 6154 Osr.
5 6155 Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should
5 6156 impart a thing to you from his majesty.
5 6157 
5 6158 Ham.
5 6159 I will receive it with all diligence of spirit. Put your
5 6160 bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head.
5 6161 
5 6162 Osr.
5 6163 I thank your lordship, t'is very hot.
5 6164 
5 6165 Ham.
5 6166 No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.
5 6167 
5 6168 Osr.
5 6169 It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
5 6170 
5 6171 Ham.
5 6172 Methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.
5 6173 
5 6174 Osr.
5 6175 Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,--as 'twere--I cannot
5 6176 tell how. But, my lord, his majesty bade me signify to you that
5 6177 he has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the
5 6178 matter,--
5 6179 
5 6180 Ham.
5 6181 I beseech you, remember,--
5 6182 [Hamlet moves him to put on his hat.]
5 6183 
5 6184 Osr.
5 6185 Nay, in good faith; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here
5 6186 is newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute
5 6187 gentleman, full of most excellent differences, of very soft
5 6188 society and great showing: indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he
5 6189 is the card or calendar of gentry; for you shall find in him the
5 6190 continent of what part a gentleman would see.
5 6191 
5 6192 Ham.
5 6193 Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;--though, I
5 6194 know, to divide him inventorially would dizzy the arithmetic of
5 6195 memory, and yet but yaw neither, in respect of his quick sail.
5 6196 But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great
5 6197 article, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to make
5 6198 true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror, and who else
5 6199 would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.
5 6200 
5 6201 Osr.
5 6202 Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
5 6203 
5 6204 Ham.
5 6205 The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman in our more
5 6206 rawer breath?
5 6207 
5 6208 Osr.
5 6209 Sir?
5 6210 
5 6211 Hor.
5 6212 Is't not possible to understand in another tongue? You will do't,
5 6213 sir, really.
5 6214 
5 6215 Ham.
5 6216 What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
5 6217 
5 6218 Osr.
5 6219 Of Laertes?
5 6220 
5 6221 Hor.
5 6222 His purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.
5 6223 
5 6224 Ham.
5 6225 Of him, sir.
5 6226 
5 6227 Osr.
5 6228 I know, you are not ignorant,--
5 6229 
5 6230 Ham.
5 6231 I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would not
5 6232 much approve me.--Well, sir.
5 6233 
5 6234 Osr.
5 6235 You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is,--
5 6236 
5 6237 Ham.
5 6238 I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in
5 6239 excellence; but to know a man well were to know himself.
5 6240 
5 6241 Osr.
5 6242 I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on
5 6243 him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
5 6244 
5 6245 Ham.
5 6246 What's his weapon?
5 6247 
5 6248 Osr.
5 6249 Rapier and dagger.
5 6250 
5 6251 Ham.
5 6252 That's two of his weapons:--but well.
5 6253 
5 6254 Osr.
5 6255 The king, sir, hath wager'd with him six Barbary horses:
5 6256 against the which he has imponed, as I take it, six French
5 6257 rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers, and
5 6258 so: three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy,
5 6259 very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of
5 6260 very liberal conceit.
5 6261 
5 6262 Ham.
5 6263 What call you the carriages?
5 6264 
5 6265 Hor.
5 6266 I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.
5 6267 
5 6268 Osr.
5 6269 The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
5 6270 
5 6271 Ham.
5 6272 The phrase would be more german to the matter if we could
5 6273 carry cannon by our sides. I would it might be hangers till then.
5 6274 But, on: six Barbary horses against six French swords, their
5 6275 assigns, and three liberal conceited carriages: that's the French
5 6276 bet against the Danish: why is this all imponed, as you call it?
5 6277 
5 6278 Osr.
5 6279 The king, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen passes between
5 6280 your and him, he shall not exceed you three hits: he hath
5 6281 laid on twelve for nine; and it would come to immediate trial
5 6282 if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.
5 6283 
5 6284 Ham.
5 6285 How if I answer no?
5 6286 
5 6287 Osr.
5 6288 I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
5 6289 
5 6290 Ham.
5 6291 Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his majesty,
5 6292 it is the breathing time of day with me: let the foils be
5 6293 brought, the gentleman willing, and the king hold his purpose,
5 6294 I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but my
5 6295 shame and the odd hits.
5 6296 
5 6297 Osr.
5 6298 Shall I re-deliver you e'en so?
5 6299 
5 6300 Ham.
5 6301 To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.
5 6302 
5 6303 Osr.
5 6304 I commend my duty to your lordship.
5 6305 
5 6306 Ham.
5 6307 Yours, yours.
5 6308 
5 6309 [Exit Osric.]
5 6310 
5 6311 He does well to commend it himself; there are no tongues else
5 6312 for's turn.
5 6313 
5 6314 Hor.
5 6315 This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
5 6316 
5 6317 Ham.
5 6318 He did comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has he,--and
5 6319 many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes on,--
5 6320 only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter;
5 6321 a kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and
5 6322 through the most fanned and winnowed opinions; and do but blow
5 6323 them to their trial, the bubbles are out,
5 6324 
5 6325 [Enter a Lord.]
5 6326 
5 6327 Lord.
5 6328 My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young Osric,
5 6329 who brings back to him that you attend him in the hall: he sends
5 6330 to know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you
5 6331 will take longer time.
5 6332 
5 6333 Ham.
5 6334 I am constant to my purposes; they follow the king's pleasure:
5 6335 if his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever, provided
5 6336 I be so able as now.
5 6337 
5 6338 Lord.
5 6339 The King and Queen and all are coming down.
5 6340 
5 6341 Ham.
5 6342 In happy time.
5 6343 
5 6344 Lord.
5 6345 The queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to
5 6346 Laertes before you fall to play.
5 6347 
5 6348 Ham.
5 6349 She well instructs me.
5 6350 
5 6351 [Exit Lord.]
5 6352 
5 6353 Hor.
5 6354 You will lose this wager, my lord.
5 6355 
5 6356 Ham.
5 6357 I do not think so; since he went into France I have been in
5 6358 continual practice: I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst not
5 6359 think how ill all's here about my heart: but it is no matter.
5 6360 
5 6361 Hor.
5 6362 Nay, good my lord,--
5 6363 
5 6364 Ham.
5 6365 It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gain-giving as
5 6366 would perhaps trouble a woman.
5 6367 
5 6368 Hor.
5 6369 If your mind dislike anything, obey it: I will forestall their
5 6370 repair hither, and say you are not fit.
5 6371 
5 6372 Ham.
5 6373 Not a whit, we defy augury: there's a special providence in
5 6374 the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come; if it be
5 6375 not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come:
5 6376 the readiness is all: since no man has aught of what he leaves,
5 6377 what is't to leave betimes?
5 6378 
5 6379 [Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Lords, Osric, and Attendants with
5 6380 foils &c.]
5 6381 
5 6382 King.
5 6383 Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
5 6384 
5 6385 [The King puts Laertes' hand into Hamlet's.]
5 6386 
5 6387 Ham.
5 6388 Give me your pardon, sir: I have done you wrong:
5 6389 But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
5 6390 This presence knows, and you must needs have heard,
5 6391 How I am punish'd with sore distraction.
5 6392 What I have done
5 6393 That might your nature, honour, and exception
5 6394 Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
5 6395 Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet:
5 6396 If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,
5 6397 And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
5 6398 Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
5 6399 Who does it, then? His madness: if't be so,
5 6400 Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
5 6401 His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
5 6402 Sir, in this audience,
5 6403 Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil
5 6404 Free me so far in your most generous thoughts
5 6405 That I have shot my arrow o'er the house
5 6406 And hurt my brother.
5 6407 
5 6408 Laer.
5 6409 I am satisfied in nature,
5 6410 Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most
5 6411 To my revenge. But in my terms of honour
5 6412 I stand aloof; and will no reconcilement
5 6413 Till by some elder masters of known honour
5 6414 I have a voice and precedent of peace
5 6415 To keep my name ungor'd. But till that time
5 6416 I do receive your offer'd love like love,
5 6417 And will not wrong it.
5 6418 
5 6419 Ham.
5 6420 I embrace it freely;
5 6421 And will this brother's wager frankly play.--
5 6422 Give us the foils; come on.
5 6423 
5 6424 Laer.
5 6425 Come, one for me.
5 6426 
5 6427 Ham.
5 6428 I'll be your foil, Laertes; in mine ignorance
5 6429 Your skill shall, like a star in the darkest night,
5 6430 Stick fiery off indeed.
5 6431 
5 6432 Laer.
5 6433 You mock me, sir.
5 6434 
5 6435 Ham.
5 6436 No, by this hand.
5 6437 
5 6438 King.
5 6439 Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
5 6440 You know the wager?
5 6441 
5 6442 Ham.
5 6443 Very well, my lord;
5 6444 Your grace has laid the odds o' the weaker side.
5 6445 
5 6446 King.
5 6447 I do not fear it; I have seen you both;
5 6448 But since he's better'd, we have therefore odds.
5 6449 
5 6450 Laer.
5 6451 This is too heavy, let me see another.
5 6452 
5 6453 Ham.
5 6454 This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
5 6455 
5 6456 [They prepare to play.]
5 6457 
5 6458 Osr.
5 6459 Ay, my good lord.
5 6460 
5 6461 King.
5 6462 Set me the stoups of wine upon that table,--
5 6463 If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
5 6464 Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
5 6465 Let all the battlements their ordnance fire;
5 6466 The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath;
5 6467 And in the cup an union shall he throw,
5 6468 Richer than that which four successive kings
5 6469 In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
5 6470 And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
5 6471 The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
5 6472 The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,
5 6473 'Now the king drinks to Hamlet.'--Come, begin:--
5 6474 And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.
5 6475 
5 6476 Ham.
5 6477 Come on, sir.
5 6478 
5 6479 Laer.
5 6480 Come, my lord.
5 6481 
5 6482 [They play.]
5 6483 
5 6484 Ham.
5 6485 One.
5 6486 
5 6487 Laer.
5 6488 No.
5 6489 
5 6490 Ham.
5 6491 Judgment!
5 6492 
5 6493 Osr.
5 6494 A hit, a very palpable hit.
5 6495 
5 6496 Laer.
5 6497 Well;--again.
5 6498 
5 6499 King.
5 6500 Stay, give me drink.--Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
5 6501 Here's to thy health.--
5 6502 
5 6503 [Trumpets sound, and cannon shot off within.]
5 6504 
5 6505 Give him the cup.
5 6506 
5 6507 Ham.
5 6508 I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile.--
5 6509 Come.--Another hit; what say you?
5 6510 
5 6511 [They play.]
5 6512 
5 6513 Laer.
5 6514 A touch, a touch, I do confess.
5 6515 
5 6516 King.
5 6517 Our son shall win.
5 6518 
5 6519 Queen.
5 6520 He's fat, and scant of breath.--
5 6521 Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows:
5 6522 The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
5 6523 
5 6524 Ham.
5 6525 Good madam!
5 6526 
5 6527 King.
5 6528 Gertrude, do not drink.
5 6529 
5 6530 Queen.
5 6531 I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.
5 6532 
5 6533 King.
5 6534 [Aside.] It is the poison'd cup; it is too late.
5 6535 
5 6536 Ham.
5 6537 I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.
5 6538 
5 6539 Queen.
5 6540 Come, let me wipe thy face.
5 6541 
5 6542 Laer.
5 6543 My lord, I'll hit him now.
5 6544 
5 6545 King.
5 6546 I do not think't.
5 6547 
5 6548 Laer.
5 6549 [Aside.] And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience.
5 6550 
5 6551 Ham.
5 6552 Come, for the third, Laertes: you but dally;
5 6553 I pray you pass with your best violence:
5 6554 I am afeard you make a wanton of me.
5 6555 
5 6556 Laer.
5 6557 Say you so? come on.
5 6558 
5 6559 [They play.]
5 6560 
5 6561 Osr.
5 6562 Nothing, neither way.
5 6563 
5 6564 Laer.
5 6565 Have at you now!
5 6566 
5 6567 [Laertes wounds Hamlet; then, in scuffling, they
5 6568 change rapiers, and Hamlet wounds Laertes.]
5 6569 
5 6570 King.
5 6571 Part them; they are incens'd.
5 6572 
5 6573 Ham.
5 6574 Nay, come again!
5 6575 
5 6576 [The Queen falls.]
5 6577 
5 6578 Osr.
5 6579 Look to the queen there, ho!
5 6580 
5 6581 Hor.
5 6582 They bleed on both sides.--How is it, my lord?
5 6583 
5 6584 Osr.
5 6585 How is't, Laertes?
5 6586 
5 6587 Laer.
5 6588 Why, as a woodcock to my own springe, Osric;
5 6589 I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
5 6590 
5 6591 Ham.
5 6592 How does the Queen?
5 6593 
5 6594 King.
5 6595 She swoons to see them bleed.
5 6596 
5 6597 Queen.
5 6598 No, no! the drink, the drink!--O my dear Hamlet!--
5 6599 The drink, the drink!--I am poison'd.
5 6600 
5 6601 [Dies.]
5 6602 
5 6603 Ham.
5 6604 O villany!--Ho! let the door be lock'd:
5 6605 Treachery! seek it out.
5 6606 
5 6607 [Laertes falls.]
5 6608 
5 6609 Laer.
5 6610 It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;
5 6611 No medicine in the world can do thee good;
5 6612 In thee there is not half an hour of life;
5 6613 The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
5 6614 Unbated and envenom'd: the foul practice
5 6615 Hath turn'd itself on me; lo, here I lie,
5 6616 Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd:
5 6617 I can no more:--the king, the king's to blame.
5 6618 
5 6619 Ham.
5 6620 The point envenom'd too!--
5 6621 Then, venom, to thy work.
5 6622 
5 6623 [Stabs the King.]
5 6624 
5 6625 Osric and Lords.
5 6626 Treason! treason!
5 6627 
5 6628 King.
5 6629 O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.
5 6630 
5 6631 Ham.
5 6632 Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,
5 6633 Drink off this potion.--Is thy union here?
5 6634 Follow my mother.
5 6635 
5 6636 [King dies.]
5 6637 
5 6638 Laer.
5 6639 He is justly serv'd;
5 6640 It is a poison temper'd by himself.--
5 6641 Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:
5 6642 Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
5 6643 Nor thine on me!
5 6644 
5 6645 [Dies.]
5 6646 
5 6647 Ham.
5 6648 Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.--
5 6649 I am dead, Horatio.--Wretched queen, adieu!--
5 6650 You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
5 6651 That are but mutes or audience to this act,
5 6652 Had I but time,--as this fell sergeant, death,
5 6653 Is strict in his arrest,--O, I could tell you,--
5 6654 But let it be.--Horatio, I am dead;
5 6655 Thou liv'st; report me and my cause aright
5 6656 To the unsatisfied.
5 6657 
5 6658 Hor.
5 6659 Never believe it:
5 6660 I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.--
5 6661 Here's yet some liquor left.
5 6662 
5 6663 Ham.
5 6664 As thou'rt a man,
5 6665 Give me the cup; let go; by heaven, I'll have't.--
5 6666 O good Horatio, what a wounded name,
5 6667 Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!
5 6668 If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,
5 6669 Absent thee from felicity awhile,
5 6670 And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
5 6671 To tell my story.--
5 6672 
5 6673 [March afar off, and shot within.]
5 6674 
5 6675 What warlike noise is this?
5 6676 
5 6677 Osr.
5 6678 Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
5 6679 To the ambassadors of England gives
5 6680 This warlike volley.
5 6681 
5 6682 Ham.
5 6683 O, I die, Horatio;
5 6684 The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:
5 6685 I cannot live to hear the news from England;
5 6686 But I do prophesy the election lights
5 6687 On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;
5 6688 So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,
5 6689 Which have solicited.--the rest is silence.
5 6690 
5 6691 [Dies.]
5 6692 
5 6693 Hor.
5 6694 Now cracks a noble heart.--Good night, sweet prince,
5 6695 And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
5 6696 Why does the drum come hither?
5 6697 
5 6698 [March within.]
5 6699 
5 6700 [Enter Fortinbras, the English Ambassadors, and others.]
5 6701 
5 6702 Fort.
5 6703 Where is this sight?
5 6704 
5 6705 Hor.
5 6706 What is it you will see?
5 6707 If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
5 6708 
5 6709 Fort.
5 6710 This quarry cries on havoc.--O proud death,
5 6711 What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,
5 6712 That thou so many princes at a shot
5 6713 So bloodily hast struck?
5 6714 
5 6715 1 Ambassador.
5 6716 The sight is dismal;
5 6717 And our affairs from England come too late:
5 6718 The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,
5 6719 To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd
5 6720 That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:
5 6721 Where should we have our thanks?
5 6722 
5 6723 Hor.
5 6724 Not from his mouth,
5 6725 Had it the ability of life to thank you:
5 6726 He never gave commandment for their death.
5 6727 But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
5 6728 You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
5 6729 Are here arriv'd, give order that these bodies
5 6730 High on a stage be placed to the view;
5 6731 And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
5 6732 How these things came about: so shall you hear
5 6733 Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts;
5 6734 Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters;
5 6735 Of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause;
5 6736 And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
5 6737 Fall'n on the inventors' heads: all this can I
5 6738 Truly deliver.
5 6739 
5 6740 Fort.
5 6741 Let us haste to hear it,
5 6742 And call the noblest to the audience.
5 6743 For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:
5 6744 I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,
5 6745 Which now, to claim my vantage doth invite me.
5 6746 
5 6747 Hor.
5 6748 Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
5 6749 And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more:
5 6750 But let this same be presently perform'd,
5 6751 Even while men's minds are wild: lest more mischance
5 6752 On plots and errors happen.
5 6753 
5 6754 Fort.
5 6755 Let four captains
5 6756 Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage;
5 6757 For he was likely, had he been put on,
5 6758 To have prov'd most royally: and, for his passage,
5 6759 The soldiers' music and the rites of war
5 6760 Speak loudly for him.--
5 6761 Take up the bodies.--Such a sight as this
5 6762 Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.
5 6763 Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
5 6764 
5 6765 [A dead march.]
5 6766 
5 6767 [Exeunt, bearing off the dead bodies; after the which a peal of
5 6768 ordnance is shot off.]
