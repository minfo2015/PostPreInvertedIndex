12 0 Much adoe about Nothing

12 2 Actus primus, Scena prima.
12 3 
12 4 Enter Leonato Gouernour of Messina, Innogen his wife, Hero his
12 5 daughter,
12 6 and Beatrice his Neece, with a messenger.
12 7 
12 8   Leonato. I learne in this Letter, that Don Peter of Arragon,
12 9 comes this night to Messina
12 10 
12 11    Mess. He is very neere by this: he was not
12 12 three Leagues off when I left him
12 13 
12 14    Leon. How many Gentlemen haue you lost in this
12 15 action?
12 16   Mess. But few of any sort, and none of name
12 17 
12 18    Leon. A victorie is twice it selfe, when the atchieuer
12 19 brings home full numbers: I finde heere, that Don Peter
12 20 hath bestowed much honor on a yong Florentine, called
12 21 Claudio
12 22 
12 23    Mess. Much deseru'd on his part, and equally remembred
12 24 by Don Pedro, he hath borne himselfe beyond the
12 25 promise of his age, doing in the figure of a Lambe, the
12 26 feats of a Lion, he hath indeede better bettred expectation,
12 27 then you must expect of me to tell you how
12 28 
12 29    Leo. He hath an Vnckle heere in Messina, wil be very
12 30 much glad of it
12 31 
12 32    Mess. I haue alreadie deliuered him letters, and there
12 33 appeares much ioy in him, euen so much, that ioy could
12 34 not shew it selfe modest enough, without a badg of bitternesse
12 35 
12 36    Leo. Did he breake out into teares?
12 37   Mess. In great measure
12 38 
12 39    Leo. A kinde ouerflow of kindnesse, there are no faces
12 40 truer, then those that are so wash'd, how much better
12 41 is it to weepe at ioy, then to ioy at weeping?
12 42   Bea. I pray you, is Signior Mountanto return'd from
12 43 the warres, or no?
12 44   Mess. I know none of that name, Lady, there was
12 45 none such in the armie of any sort
12 46 
12 47    Leon. What is he that you aske for Neece?
12 48   Hero. My cousin meanes Signior Benedick of Padua
12 49   Mess. O he's return'd, and as pleasant as euer he was
12 50 
12 51    Beat. He set vp his bils here in Messina, & challeng'd
12 52 Cupid at the Flight: and my Vnckles foole reading the
12 53 Challenge, subscrib'd for Cupid, and challeng'd him at
12 54 the Burbolt. I pray you, how many hath hee kil'd and
12 55 eaten in these warres? But how many hath he kil'd? for
12 56 indeed, I promis'd to eate all of his killing
12 57 
12 58    Leon. 'Faith Neece, you taxe Signior Benedicke too
12 59 much, but hee'l be meete with you, I doubt it not
12 60 
12 61    Mess. He hath done good seruice Lady in these wars
12 62 
12 63    Beat. You had musty victuall, and he hath holpe to
12 64 ease it: he's a very valiant Trencher-man, hee hath an
12 65 excellent stomacke
12 66 
12 67    Mess. And a good souldier too Lady
12 68 
12 69    Beat. And a good souldier to a Lady. But what is he
12 70 to a Lord?
12 71   Mess. A Lord to a Lord, a man to a man, stuft with
12 72 all honourable vertues
12 73 
12 74    Beat. It is so indeed, he is no lesse then a stuft man:
12 75 but for the stuffing well, we are all mortall
12 76 
12 77    Leon. You must not (sir) mistake my Neece, there is
12 78 a kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick, & her:
12 79 they neuer meet, but there's a skirmish of wit between
12 80 them
12 81 
12 82    Bea. Alas, he gets nothing by that. In our last conflict,
12 83 foure of his fiue wits went halting off, and now is
12 84 the whole man gouern'd with one: so that if hee haue
12 85 wit enough to keepe himselfe warme, let him beare it
12 86 for a difference betweene himselfe and his horse: For it
12 87 is all the wealth that he hath left, to be knowne a reasonable
12 88 creature. Who is his companion now? He hath
12 89 euery month a new sworne brother
12 90 
12 91    Mess. Is't possible?
12 92   Beat. Very easily possible: he weares his faith but as
12 93 the fashion of his hat, it euer changes with y next block
12 94 
12 95    Mess. I see (Lady) the Gentleman is not in your
12 96 bookes
12 97 
12 98    Bea. No, and he were, I would burne my study. But
12 99 I pray you, who is his companion? Is there no young
12 100 squarer now, that will make a voyage with him to the
12 101 diuell?
12 102   Mess. He is most in the company of the right noble
12 103 Claudio
12 104 
12 105    Beat. O Lord, he will hang vpon him like a disease:
12 106 he is sooner caught then the pestilence, and the taker
12 107 runs presently mad. God helpe the noble Claudio, if hee
12 108 haue caught the Benedict, it will cost him a thousand
12 109 pound ere he be cur'd
12 110 
12 111    Mess. I will hold friends with you Lady
12 112 
12 113    Bea. Do good friend
12 114 
12 115    Leo. You'l ne're run mad Neece
12 116 
12 117    Bea. No, not till a hot Ianuary
12 118 
12 119    Mess. Don Pedro is approach'd.
12 120 
12 121 Enter don Pedro, Claudio, Benedicke, Balthasar, and Iohn the
12 122 bastard.
12 123 
12 124   Pedro. Good Signior Leonato, you are come to meet
12 125 your trouble: the fashion of the world is to auoid cost,
12 126 and you encounter it
12 127 
12 128    Leon. Neuer came trouble to my house in the likenes
12 129 of your Grace: for trouble being gone, comfort should
12 130 remaine: but when you depart from me, sorrow abides,
12 131 and happinesse takes his leaue
12 132 
12 133    Pedro. You embrace your charge too willingly: I
12 134 thinke this is your daughter
12 135 
12 136    Leonato. Her mother hath many times told me so
12 137 
12 138    Bened. Were you in doubt that you askt her?
12 139   Leonato. Signior Benedicke, no, for then were you a
12 140 childe
12 141 
12 142    Pedro. You haue it full Benedicke, we may ghesse by
12 143 this, what you are, being a man, truely the Lady fathers
12 144 her selfe: be happie Lady, for you are like an honorable
12 145 father
12 146 
12 147    Ben. If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not
12 148 haue his head on her shoulders for al Messina, as like him
12 149 as she is
12 150 
12 151    Beat. I wonder that you will still be talking, signior
12 152 Benedicke, no body markes you
12 153 
12 154    Ben. What my deere Ladie Disdaine! are you yet
12 155 liuing?
12 156   Beat. Is it possible Disdaine should die, while shee
12 157 hath such meete foode to feede it, as Signior Benedicke?
12 158 Curtesie it selfe must conuert to Disdaine, if you come in
12 159 her presence
12 160 
12 161    Bene. Then is curtesie a turne-coate, but it is certaine
12 162 I am loued of all Ladies, onely you excepted: and
12 163 I would I could finde in my heart that I had not a hard
12 164 heart, for truely I loue none
12 165 
12 166    Beat. A deere happinesse to women, they would else
12 167 haue beene troubled with a pernitious Suter, I thanke
12 168 God and my cold blood, I am of your humour for that, I
12 169 had rather heare my Dog barke at a Crow, than a man
12 170 sweare he loues me
12 171 
12 172    Bene. God keepe your Ladiship still in that minde,
12 173 so some Gentleman or other shall scape a predestinate
12 174 scratcht face
12 175 
12 176    Beat. Scratching could not make it worse, and 'twere
12 177 such a face as yours were
12 178 
12 179    Bene. Well, you are a rare Parrat teacher
12 180 
12 181    Beat. A bird of my tongue, is better than a beast of
12 182 your
12 183 
12 184    Ben. I would my horse had the speed of your tongue,
12 185 and so good a continuer, but keepe your way a Gods
12 186 name, I haue done
12 187 
12 188    Beat. You alwaies end with a Iades tricke, I know
12 189 you of old
12 190 
12 191    Pedro. This is the summe of all: Leonato, signior Claudio,
12 192 and signior Benedicke; my deere friend Leonato, hath
12 193 inuited you all, I tell him we shall stay here, at the least
12 194 a moneth, and he heartily praies some occasion may detaine
12 195 vs longer: I dare sweare hee is no hypocrite, but
12 196 praies from his heart
12 197 
12 198    Leon. If you sweare, my Lord, you shall not be forsworne,
12 199 let mee bid you welcome, my Lord, being reconciled
12 200 to the Prince your brother: I owe you all
12 201 duetie
12 202 
12 203    Iohn. I thanke you, I am not of many words, but I
12 204 thanke you
12 205 
12 206    Leon. Please it your grace leade on?
12 207   Pedro. Your hand Leonato, we will goe together.
12 208 
12 209 Exeunt. Manet Benedicke and Claudio.
12 210 
12 211   Clau. Benedicke, didst thou note the daughter of signior
12 212 Leonato?
12 213   Bene. I noted her not, but I lookt on her
12 214 
12 215    Claud. Is she not a modest yong Ladie?
12 216   Bene. Doe you question me as an honest man should
12 217 doe, for my simple true iudgement? or would you haue
12 218 me speake after my custome, as being a professed tyrant
12 219 to their sexe?
12 220   Clau. No, I pray thee speake in sober iudgement
12 221 
12 222    Bene. Why yfaith me thinks shee's too low for a hie
12 223 praise, too browne for a faire praise, and too little for a
12 224 great praise, onely this commendation I can affoord her,
12 225 that were shee other then she is, she were vnhandsome,
12 226 and being no other, but as she is, I doe not like her
12 227 
12 228    Clau. Thou think'st I am in sport, I pray thee tell me
12 229 truely how thou lik'st her
12 230 
12 231    Bene. Would you buie her, that you enquier after
12 232 her?
12 233   Clau. Can the world buie such a iewell?
12 234   Ben. Yea, and a case to put it into, but speake you this
12 235 with a sad brow? Or doe you play the flowting iacke, to
12 236 tell vs Cupid is a good Hare-finder, and Vulcan a rare
12 237 Carpenter: Come, in what key shall a man take you to
12 238 goe in the song?
12 239   Clau. In mine eie, she is the sweetest Ladie that euer
12 240 I lookt on
12 241 
12 242    Bene. I can see yet without spectacles, and I see no
12 243 such matter: there's her cosin, and she were not possest
12 244 with a furie, exceedes her as much in beautie, as the first
12 245 of Maie doth the last of December: but I hope you haue
12 246 no intent to turne husband, haue you?
12 247   Clau. I would scarce trust my selfe, though I had
12 248 sworne the contrarie, if Hero would be my wife
12 249 
12 250    Bene. Ist come to this? in faith hath not the world one
12 251 man but he will weare his cap with suspition? shall I neuer
12 252 see a batcheller of three score againe? goe to yfaith,
12 253 and thou wilt needes thrust thy necke into a yoke, weare
12 254 the print of it, and sigh away sundaies: looke, don Pedro
12 255 is returned to seeke you.
12 256 
12 257 Enter don Pedro, Iohn the bastard.
12 258 
12 259   Pedr. What secret hath held you here, that you followed
12 260 not to Leonatoes?
12 261   Bened. I would your Grace would constraine mee to
12 262 tell
12 263 
12 264    Pedro. I charge thee on thy allegeance
12 265 
12 266    Ben. You heare, Count Claudio, I can be secret as a
12 267 dumbe man, I would haue you thinke so (but on my allegiance,
12 268 marke you this, on my allegiance) hee is in
12 269 loue, With who? now that is your Graces part: marke
12 270 how short his answere is, with Hero, Leonatoes short
12 271 daughter
12 272 
12 273    Clau. If this were so, so were it vttred
12 274 
12 275    Bened. Like the old tale, my Lord, it is not so, nor 'twas
12 276 not so: but indeede, God forbid it should be so
12 277 
12 278    Clau. If my passion change not shortly, God forbid it
12 279 should be otherwise
12 280 
12 281    Pedro. Amen, if you loue her, for the Ladie is verie
12 282 well worthie
12 283 
12 284    Clau. You speake this to fetch me in, my Lord
12 285 
12 286    Pedr. By my troth I speake my thought
12 287 
12 288    Clau. And in faith, my Lord, I spoke mine
12 289 
12 290    Bened. And by my two faiths and troths, my Lord, I
12 291 speake mine
12 292 
12 293    Clau. That I loue her, I feele
12 294 
12 295    Pedr. That she is worthie, I know
12 296 
12 297    Bened. That I neither feele how shee should be loued,
12 298 nor know how shee should be worthie, is the
12 299 opinion that fire cannot melt out of me, I will die in it at
12 300 the stake
12 301 
12 302    Pedr. Thou wast euer an obstinate heretique in the despight
12 303 of Beautie
12 304 
12 305    Clau. And neuer could maintaine his part, but in the
12 306 force of his will
12 307   Ben. That a woman conceiued me, I thanke her: that
12 308 she brought mee vp, I likewise giue her most humble
12 309 thankes: but that I will haue a rechate winded in my
12 310 forehead, or hang my bugle in an inuisible baldricke, all
12 311 women shall pardon me: because I will not do them the
12 312 wrong to mistrust any, I will doe my selfe the right to
12 313 trust none: and the fine is, (for the which I may goe the
12 314 finer) I will liue a Batchellor
12 315 
12 316    Pedro. I shall see thee ere I die, looke pale with loue
12 317 
12 318    Bene. With anger, with sicknesse, or with hunger,
12 319 my Lord, not with loue: proue that euer I loose more
12 320 blood with loue, then I will get againe with drinking,
12 321 picke out mine eyes with a Ballet-makers penne, and
12 322 hang me vp at the doore of a brothel-house for the signe
12 323 of blinde Cupid
12 324 
12 325    Pedro. Well, if euer thou doost fall from this faith,
12 326 thou wilt proue a notable argument
12 327 
12 328    Bene. If I do, hang me in a bottle like a Cat, & shoot
12 329 at me, and he that hit's me, let him be clapt on the shoulder,
12 330 and cal'd Adam
12 331 
12 332    Pedro. Well, as time shall trie: In time the sauage
12 333 Bull doth beare the yoake
12 334 
12 335    Bene. The sauage bull may, but if euer the sensible
12 336 Benedicke beare it, plucke off the bulles hornes, and set
12 337 them in my forehead, and let me be vildely painted, and
12 338 in such great Letters as they write, heere is good horse
12 339 to hire: let them signifie vnder my signe, here you may
12 340 see Benedicke the married man
12 341 
12 342    Clau. If this should euer happen, thou wouldst bee
12 343 horne mad
12 344 
12 345    Pedro. Nay, if Cupid haue not spent all his Quiuer in
12 346 Venice, thou wilt quake for this shortly
12 347 
12 348    Bene. I looke for an earthquake too then
12 349 
12 350    Pedro. Well, you will temporize with the houres, in
12 351 the meane time, good Signior Benedicke, repaire to Leonatoes,
12 352 commend me to him, and tell him I will not faile
12 353 him at supper, for indeede he hath made great preparation
12 354 
12 355    Bene. I haue almost matter enough in me for such an
12 356 Embassage, and so I commit you
12 357 
12 358    Clau. To the tuition of God. From my house, if I
12 359 had it
12 360 
12 361    Pedro. The sixt of Iuly. Your louing friend, Benedick
12 362 
12 363    Bene. Nay mocke not, mocke not; the body of your
12 364 discourse is sometime guarded with fragments, and the
12 365 guardes are but slightly basted on neither, ere you flout
12 366 old ends any further, examine your conscience, and so I
12 367 leaue you.
12 368 
12 369 Enter.
12 370 
12 371   Clau. My Liege, your Highnesse now may doe mee
12 372 good
12 373 
12 374    Pedro. My loue is thine to teach, teach it but how,
12 375 And thou shalt see how apt it is to learne
12 376 Any hard Lesson that may do thee good
12 377 
12 378    Clau. Hath Leonato any sonne my Lord?
12 379   Pedro. No childe but Hero, she's his onely heire.
12 380 Dost thou affect her Claudio?
12 381   Clau. O my Lord,
12 382 When you went onward on this ended action,
12 383 I look'd vpon her with a souldiers eie,
12 384 That lik'd, but had a rougher taske in hand,
12 385 Than to driue liking to the name of loue:
12 386 But now I am return'd, and that warre-thoughts
12 387 Haue left their places vacant: in their roomes,
12 388 Come thronging soft and delicate desires,
12 389 All prompting mee how faire yong Hero is,
12 390 Saying I lik'd her ere I went to warres
12 391 
12 392    Pedro. Thou wilt be like a louer presently,
12 393 And tire the hearer with a booke of words:
12 394 If thou dost loue faire Hero, cherish it,
12 395 And I will breake with her: wast not to this end,
12 396 That thou beganst to twist so fine a story?
12 397   Clau. How sweetly doe you minister to loue,
12 398 That know loues griefe by his complexion!
12 399 But lest my liking might too sodaine seeme,
12 400 I would haue salu'd it with a longer treatise
12 401 
12 402    Ped. What need y bridge much broder then the flood?
12 403 The fairest graunt is the necessitie:
12 404 Looke what will serue, is fit: 'tis once, thou louest,
12 405 And I will fit thee with the remedie,
12 406 I know we shall haue reuelling to night,
12 407 I will assume thy part in some disguise,
12 408 And tell faire Hero I am Claudio,
12 409 And in her bosome Ile vnclaspe my heart,
12 410 And take her hearing prisoner with the force
12 411 And strong incounter of my amorous tale:
12 412 Then after, to her father will I breake,
12 413 And the conclusion is, shee shall be thine,
12 414 In practise let vs put it presently.
12 415 
12 416 Exeunt.
12 417 
12 418 Enter Leonato and an old man, brother to Leonato.
12 419 
12 420   Leo. How now brother, where is my cosen your son:
12 421 hath he prouided this musicke?
12 422   Old. He is very busie about it, but brother, I can tell
12 423 you newes that you yet dreamt not of
12 424 
12 425    Lo. Are they good?
12 426   Old. As the euents stamps them, but they haue a good
12 427 couer: they shew well outward, the Prince and Count
12 428 Claudio walking in a thick pleached alley in my orchard,
12 429 were thus ouer-heard by a man of mine: the Prince discouered
12 430 to Claudio that hee loued my niece your daughter,
12 431 and meant to acknowledge it this night in a dance,
12 432 and if hee found her accordant, hee meant to take the
12 433 present time by the top, and instantly breake with you
12 434 of it
12 435 
12 436    Leo. Hath the fellow any wit that told you this?
12 437   Old. A good sharpe fellow, I will send for him, and
12 438 question him your selfe
12 439 
12 440    Leo. No, no; wee will hold it as a dreame, till it appeare
12 441 it selfe: but I will acquaint my daughter withall,
12 442 that she may be the better prepared for an answer, if peraduenture
12 443 this bee true: goe you and tell her of it: coosins,
12 444 you know what you haue to doe, O I crie you mercie
12 445 friend, goe you with mee and I will vse your skill,
12 446 good cosin haue a care this busie time.
12 447 
12 448 Exeunt.
12 449 
12 450 Enter Sir Iohn the Bastard, and Conrade his companion.
12 451 
12 452   Con. What the good yeere my Lord, why are you
12 453 thus out of measure sad?
12 454   Ioh. There is no measure in the occasion that breeds,
12 455 therefore the sadnesse is without limit
12 456 
12 457    Con. You should heare reason
12 458 
12 459    Iohn. And when I haue heard it, what blessing bringeth
12 460 it?
12 461   Con. If not a present remedy, yet a patient sufferance
12 462 
12 463    Ioh. I wonder that thou (being as thou saist thou art,
12 464 borne vnder Saturne) goest about to apply a morall medicine,
12 465 to a mortifying mischiefe: I cannot hide what I
12 466 am: I must bee sad when I haue cause, and smile at no
12 467 mans iests, eat when I haue stomacke, and wait for no
12 468 mans leisure: sleepe when I am drowsie, and tend on no
12 469 mans businesse, laugh when I am merry, and claw no man
12 470 in his humor
12 471 
12 472    Con. Yea, but you must not make the ful show of this,
12 473 till you may doe it without controllment, you haue of
12 474 late stood out against your brother, and hee hath tane
12 475 you newly into his grace, where it is impossible you
12 476 should take root, but by the faire weather that you make
12 477 your selfe, it is needful that you frame the season for your
12 478 owne haruest
12 479 
12 480    Iohn. I had rather be a canker in a hedge, then a rose
12 481 in his grace, and it better fits my bloud to be disdain'd of
12 482 all, then to fashion a carriage to rob loue from any: in this
12 483 (though I cannot be said to be a flattering honest man)
12 484 it must not be denied but I am a plaine dealing villaine, I
12 485 am trusted with a mussell, and enfranchisde with a clog,
12 486 therefore I haue decreed, not to sing in my cage: if I had
12 487 my mouth, I would bite: if I had my liberty, I would do
12 488 my liking: in the meane time, let me be that I am, and
12 489 seeke not to alter me
12 490 
12 491    Con. Can you make no vse of your discontent?
12 492   Iohn. I will make all vse of it, for I vse it onely.
12 493 Who comes here? what newes Borachio?
12 494 
12 495 Enter Borachio.
12 496 
12 497   Bor. I came yonder from a great supper, the Prince
12 498 your brother is royally entertained by Leonato, and I can
12 499 giue you intelligence of an intended marriage
12 500 
12 501    Iohn. Will it serue for any Modell to build mischiefe
12 502 on? What is hee for a foole that betrothes himselfe to
12 503 vnquietnesse?
12 504   Bor. Mary it is your brothers right hand
12 505 
12 506    Iohn. Who, the most exquisite Claudio?
12 507   Bor. Euen he
12 508 
12 509    Iohn. A proper squier, and who, and who, which way
12 510 lookes he?
12 511   Bor. Mary on Hero, the daughter and Heire of Leonato
12 512 
12 513    Iohn. A very forward March-chicke, how came you
12 514 to this:
12 515   Bor. Being entertain'd for a perfumer, as I was smoaking
12 516 a musty roome, comes me the Prince and Claudio,
12 517 hand in hand in sad conference: I whipt behind the Arras,
12 518 and there heard it agreed vpon, that the Prince should
12 519 wooe Hero for himselfe, and hauing obtain'd her, giue
12 520 her to Count Claudio
12 521 
12 522    Iohn. Come, come, let vs thither, this may proue food
12 523 to my displeasure, that young start-vp hath all the glorie
12 524 of my ouerthrow: if I can crosse him any way, I blesse
12 525 my selfe euery way, you are both sure, and will assist
12 526 mee?
12 527   Conr. To the death my Lord
12 528 
12 529    Iohn. Let vs to the great supper, their cheere is the
12 530 greater that I am subdued, would the Cooke were of my
12 531 minde: shall we goe proue whats to be done?
12 532   Bor. Wee'll wait vpon your Lordship.
12 533 
12 534 Exeunt.
12 535 
12 536 
12 537 Actus Secundus.
12 538 
12 539 Enter Leonato, his brother, his wife, Hero his daughter, and
12 540 Beatrice his
12 541 neece, and a kinsman.
12 542 
12 543   Leonato. Was not Count Iohn here at supper?
12 544   Brother. I saw him not
12 545 
12 546    Beatrice. How tartly that Gentleman lookes, I neuer
12 547 can see him, but I am heart-burn'd an howre after
12 548 
12 549    Hero. He is of a very melancholy disposition
12 550 
12 551    Beatrice. Hee were an excellent man that were made
12 552 iust in the mid-way betweene him and Benedicke, the one
12 553 is too like an image and saies nothing, and the other too
12 554 like my Ladies eldest sonne, euermore tatling
12 555 
12 556    Leon. Then halfe signior Benedicks tongue in Count
12 557 Iohns mouth, and halfe Count Iohns melancholy in Signior
12 558 Benedicks face
12 559 
12 560    Beat. With a good legge, and a good foot vnckle, and
12 561 money enough in his purse, such a man would winne any
12 562 woman in the world, if he could get her good will
12 563 
12 564    Leon. By my troth Neece, thou wilt neuer get thee a
12 565 husband, if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue
12 566 
12 567    Brother. Infaith shee's too curst
12 568 
12 569    Beat. Too curst is more then curst, I shall lessen Gods
12 570 sending that way: for it is said, God sends a curst Cow
12 571 short hornes, but to a Cow too curst he sends none
12 572 
12 573    Leon. So, by being too curst, God will send you no
12 574 hornes
12 575 
12 576    Beat. Iust, if he send me no husband, for the which
12 577 blessing, I am at him vpon my knees euery morning and
12 578 euening: Lord, I could not endure a husband with a
12 579 beard on his face, I had rather lie in the woollen
12 580 
12 581    Leonato. You may light vpon a husband that hath no
12 582 beard
12 583 
12 584    Beatrice. What should I doe with him? dresse him in
12 585 my apparell, and make him my waiting gentlewoman? he
12 586 that hath a beard, is more then a youth: and he that hath
12 587 no beard, is lesse then a man: and hee that is more then a
12 588 youth, is not for mee: and he that is lesse then a man, I am
12 589 not for him: therefore I will euen take sixepence in earnest
12 590 of the Berrord, and leade his Apes into hell
12 591 
12 592    Leon. Well then, goe you into hell
12 593 
12 594    Beat. No, but to the gate, and there will the Deuill
12 595 meete mee like an old Cuckold with hornes on his head,
12 596 and say, get you to heauen Beatrice, get you to heauen,
12 597 heere's no place for you maids, so deliuer I vp my Apes,
12 598 and away to S[aint]. Peter: for the heauens, hee shewes mee
12 599 where the Batchellers sit, and there liue wee as merry as
12 600 the day is long
12 601 
12 602    Brother. Well neece, I trust you will be rul'd by your
12 603 father
12 604 
12 605    Beatrice. Yes faith, it is my cosens dutie to make curtsie,
12 606 and say, as it please you: but yet for all that cosin, let
12 607 him be a handsome fellow, or else make an other cursie,
12 608 and say, father, as it please me
12 609 
12 610    Leonato. Well neece, I hope to see you one day fitted
12 611 with a husband
12 612 
12 613    Beatrice. Not till God make men of some other mettall
12 614 then earth, would it not grieue a woman to be ouermastred
12 615 with a peece of valiant dust: to make account of
12 616 her life to a clod of waiward marle? no vnckle, ile none:
12 617 Adams sonnes are my brethren, and truly I hold it a sinne
12 618 to match in my kinred
12 619 
12 620    Leon. Daughter, remember what I told you, if the
12 621 Prince doe solicit you in that kinde, you know your answere
12 622 
12 623    Beatrice. The fault will be in the musicke cosin, if you
12 624 be not woed in good time: if the Prince bee too important,
12 625 tell him there is measure in euery thing, & so dance
12 626 out the answere, for heare me Hero, wooing, wedding, &
12 627 repenting, is as a Scotch jigge, a measure, and a cinquepace:
12 628 the first suite is hot and hasty like a Scotch jigge
12 629 (and full as fantasticall) the wedding manerly modest,
12 630 (as a measure) full of state & aunchentry, and then comes
12 631 repentance, and with his bad legs falls into the cinquepace
12 632 faster and faster, till he sinkes into his graue
12 633 
12 634    Leonato. Cosin you apprehend passing shrewdly
12 635 
12 636    Beatrice. I haue a good eye vnckle, I can see a Church
12 637 by daylight
12 638 
12 639    Leon. The reuellers are entring brother, make good
12 640 roome.
12 641 Enter Prince, Pedro, Claudio, and Benedicke, and Balthasar, or
12 642 dumbe Iohn,
12 643 Maskers with a drum.
12 644 
12 645   Pedro. Lady, will you walke about with your friend?
12 646   Hero. So you walke softly, and looke sweetly, and say
12 647 nothing, I am yours for the walke, and especially when I
12 648 walke away
12 649 
12 650    Pedro. With me in your company
12 651 
12 652    Hero. I may say so when I please
12 653 
12 654    Pedro. And when please you to say so?
12 655   Hero. When I like your fauour, for God defend the
12 656 Lute should be like the case
12 657 
12 658    Pedro. My visor is Philemons roofe, within the house
12 659 is Loue
12 660 
12 661    Hero. Why then your visor should be thatcht
12 662 
12 663    Pedro. Speake low if you speake Loue
12 664 
12 665    Bene. Well, I would you did like me
12 666 
12 667    Mar. So would not I for your owne sake, for I haue
12 668 manie ill qualities
12 669 
12 670    Bene. Which is one?
12 671   Mar. I say my prayers alowd
12 672 
12 673    Ben. I loue you the better, the hearers may cry Amen
12 674 
12 675    Mar. God match me with a good dauncer
12 676 
12 677    Balt. Amen
12 678 
12 679    Mar. And God keepe him out of my sight when the
12 680 daunce is done: answer Clarke
12 681 
12 682    Balt. No more words, the Clarke is answered
12 683 
12 684    Vrsula. I know you well enough, you are Signior Anthonio
12 685 
12 686    Anth. At a word, I am not
12 687 
12 688    Vrsula. I know you by the wagling of your head
12 689 
12 690    Anth. To tell you true, I counterfet him
12 691 
12 692    Vrsu. You could neuer doe him so ill well, vnlesse
12 693 you were the very man: here's his dry hand vp & down,
12 694 you are he, you are he
12 695 
12 696    Anth. At a word I am not
12 697 
12 698    Vrsula. Come, come, doe you thinke I doe not know
12 699 you by your excellent wit? can vertue hide it selfe? goe
12 700 to mumme, you are he, graces will appeare, and there's
12 701 an end
12 702 
12 703    Beat. Will you not tell me who told you so?
12 704   Bene. No, you shall pardon me
12 705 
12 706    Beat. Nor will you not tell me who you are?
12 707   Bened. Not now
12 708 
12 709    Beat. That I was disdainfull, and that I had my good
12 710 wit out of the hundred merry tales: well, this was Signior
12 711 Benedicke that said so
12 712 
12 713    Bene. What's he?
12 714   Beat. I am sure you know him well enough
12 715 
12 716    Bene. Not I, beleeue me
12 717 
12 718    Beat. Did he neuer make you laugh?
12 719   Bene. I pray you what is he?
12 720   Beat. Why he is the Princes ieaster, a very dull foole,
12 721 onely his gift is, in deuising impossible slanders, none
12 722 but Libertines delight in him, and the commendation is
12 723 not in his witte, but in his villanie, for hee both pleaseth
12 724 men and angers them, and then they laugh at him, and
12 725 beat him: I am sure he is in the Fleet, I would he had
12 726 boorded me
12 727 
12 728    Bene. When I know the Gentleman, Ile tell him what
12 729 you say
12 730 
12 731    Beat. Do, do, hee'l but breake a comparison or two
12 732 on me, which peraduenture (not markt, or not laugh'd
12 733 at) strikes him into melancholly, and then there's a Partridge
12 734 wing saued, for the foole will eate no supper that
12 735 night. We must follow the Leaders
12 736 
12 737    Ben. In euery good thing
12 738 
12 739    Bea. Nay, if they leade to any ill, I will leaue them
12 740 at the next turning.
12 741 
12 742 Exeunt.
12 743 
12 744 Musicke for the dance.
12 745 
12 746   Iohn. Sure my brother is amorous on Hero, and hath
12 747 withdrawne her father to breake with him about it: the
12 748 Ladies follow her, and but one visor remaines
12 749 
12 750    Borachio. And that is Claudio, I know him by his bearing
12 751 
12 752    Iohn. Are not you signior Benedicke?
12 753   Clau. You know me well, I am hee
12 754 
12 755    Iohn. Signior, you are verie neere my Brother in his
12 756 loue, he is enamor'd on Hero, I pray you disswade him
12 757 from her, she is no equall for his birth: you may do the
12 758 part of an honest man in it
12 759 
12 760    Claudio. How know you he loues her?
12 761   Iohn. I heard him sweare his affection
12 762 
12 763    Bor. So did I too, and he swore he would marrie her
12 764 to night
12 765 
12 766    Iohn. Come, let vs to the banquet.
12 767 
12 768 Ex. manet Clau.
12 769 
12 770   Clau. Thus answere I in name of Benedicke,
12 771 But heare these ill newes with the eares of Claudio:
12 772 'Tis certaine so, the Prince woes for himselfe:
12 773 Friendship is constant in all other things,
12 774 Saue in the Office and affaires of loue:
12 775 Therefore all hearts in loue vse their owne tongues.
12 776 Let euerie eye negotiate for it selfe,
12 777 And trust no Agent: for beautie is a witch,
12 778 Against whose charmes, faith melteth into blood:
12 779 This is an accident of hourely proofe,
12 780 Which I mistrusted not. Farewell therefore Hero.
12 781 Enter Benedicke.
12 782 
12 783   Ben. Count Claudio
12 784 
12 785    Clau. Yea, the same
12 786 
12 787    Ben. Come, will you goe with me?
12 788   Clau. Whither?
12 789   Ben. Euen to the next Willow, about your own businesse,
12 790 Count. What fashion will you weare the Garland
12 791 off? About your necke, like an Vsurers chaine? Or
12 792 vnder your arme, like a Lieutenants scarfe? You must
12 793 weare it one way, for the Prince hath got your Hero
12 794 
12 795    Clau . I wish him ioy of her
12 796 
12 797    Ben. Why that's spoken like an honest Drouier, so
12 798 they sel Bullockes: but did you thinke the Prince wold
12 799 haue serued you thus?
12 800   Clau. I pray you leaue me
12 801 
12 802    Ben. Ho now you strike like the blindman, 'twas the
12 803 boy that stole your meate, and you'l beat the post
12 804 
12 805    Clau. If it will not be, Ile leaue you.
12 806 Enter.
12 807 
12 808   Ben. Alas poore hurt fowle, now will he creepe into
12 809 sedges: But that my Ladie Beatrice should know me, &
12 810 not know me: the Princes foole! Hah? It may be I goe
12 811 vnder that title, because I am merrie: yea but so I am
12 812 apt to do my selfe wrong: I am not so reputed, it is the
12 813 base (though bitter) disposition of Beatrice, that putt's
12 814 the world into her person, and so giues me out: well, Ile
12 815 be reuenged as I may.
12 816 Enter the Prince.
12 817 
12 818   Pedro. Now Signior, where's the Count, did you
12 819 see him?
12 820   Bene. Troth my Lord, I haue played the part of Lady
12 821 Fame, I found him heere as melancholy as a Lodge in a
12 822 Warren, I told him, and I thinke, told him true, that your
12 823 grace had got the will of this young Lady, and I offered
12 824 him my company to a willow tree, either to make him a
12 825 garland, as being forsaken, or to binde him a rod, as being
12 826 worthy to be whipt
12 827 
12 828    Pedro. To be whipt, what's his fault?
12 829   Bene. The flat transgression of a Schoole-boy, who
12 830 being ouer-ioyed with finding a birds nest, shewes it his
12 831 companion, and he steales it
12 832 
12 833    Pedro. Wilt thou make a trust, a transgression? the
12 834 transgression is in the stealer
12 835 
12 836    Ben. Yet it had not been amisse the rod had beene
12 837 made, and the garland too, for the garland he might haue
12 838 worne himselfe, and the rod hee might haue bestowed on
12 839 you, who (as I take it) haue stolne his birds nest
12 840 
12 841    Pedro. I will but teach them to sing, and restore them
12 842 to the owner
12 843 
12 844    Bene. If their singing answer your saying, by my faith
12 845 you say honestly
12 846 
12 847    Pedro. The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrell to you, the
12 848 Gentleman that daunst with her, told her shee is much
12 849 wrong'd by you
12 850 
12 851    Bene. O she misusde me past the indurance of a block:
12 852 an oake but with one greene leafe on it, would haue answered
12 853 her: my very visor began to assume life, and scold
12 854 with her: shee told mee, not thinking I had beene my
12 855 selfe, that I was the Princes Iester, and that I was duller
12 856 then a great thaw, hudling iest vpon iest, with such impossible
12 857 conueiance vpon me, that I stood like a man at a
12 858 marke, with a whole army shooting at me: shee speakes
12 859 poynyards, and euery word stabbes: if her breath were
12 860 as terrible as terminations, there were no liuing neere
12 861 her, she would infect to the north starre: I would not
12 862 marry her, though she were indowed with all that Adam
12 863 had left him before he transgrest, she would haue made
12 864   Hercules haue turnd spit, yea, and haue cleft his club to
12 865 make the fire too: come, talke not of her, you shall finde
12 866 her the infernall Ate in good apparell. I would to God
12 867 some scholler would coniure her, for certainely while she
12 868 is heere, a man may liue as quiet in hell, as in a sanctuary,
12 869 and people sinne vpon purpose, because they would goe
12 870 thither, so indeed all disquiet, horror, and perturbation
12 871 followes her.
12 872 Enter Claudio and Beatrice, Leonato, Hero.
12 873 
12 874   Pedro. Looke heere she comes
12 875 
12 876    Bene. Will your Grace command mee any seruice to
12 877 the worlds end? I will goe on the slightest arrand now
12 878 to the Antypodes that you can deuise to send me on: I
12 879 will fetch you a tooth-picker now from the furthest inch
12 880 of Asia: bring you the length of Prester Iohns foot: fetch
12 881 you a hayre off the great Chams beard: doe you any embassage
12 882 to the Pigmies, rather then hould three words
12 883 conference, with this Harpy: you haue no employment
12 884 for me?
12 885   Pedro. None, but to desire your good company
12 886 
12 887    Bene. O God sir, heeres a dish I loue not, I cannot indure
12 888 this Lady tongue.
12 889 Enter.
12 890 
12 891   Pedr. Come Lady, come, you haue lost the heart of
12 892 Signior Benedicke
12 893 
12 894    Beatr. Indeed my Lord, hee lent it me a while, and I
12 895 gaue him vse for it, a double heart for a single one, marry
12 896 once before he wonne it of mee, with false dice, therefore
12 897 your Grace may well say I haue lost it
12 898 
12 899    Pedro. You haue put him downe Lady, you haue put
12 900 him downe
12 901 
12 902    Beat. So I would not he should do me, my Lord, lest
12 903 I should prooue the mother of fooles: I haue brought
12 904 Count Claudio, whom you sent me to seeke
12 905 
12 906    Pedro. Why how now Count, wherfore are you sad?
12 907   Claud. Not sad my Lord
12 908 
12 909    Pedro. How then? sicke?
12 910   Claud. Neither, my Lord
12 911 
12 912    Beat. The Count is neither sad, nor sicke, nor merry,
12 913 nor well: but ciuill Count, ciuill as an Orange, and something
12 914 of a iealous complexion
12 915 
12 916    Pedro. Ifaith Lady, I thinke your blazon to be true.
12 917 though Ile be sworne, if hee be so, his conceit is false:
12 918 heere Claudio, I haue wooed in thy name, and faire Hero
12 919 is won, I haue broke with her father, and his good will
12 920 obtained, name the day of marriage, and God giue
12 921 thee ioy
12 922 
12 923    Leona. Count, take of me my daughter, and with her
12 924 my fortunes: his grace hath made the match, & all grace
12 925 say, Amen to it
12 926 
12 927    Beatr. Speake Count, tis your Qu
12 928 
12 929    Claud. Silence is the perfectest Herault of ioy, I were
12 930 but little happy if I could say, how much? Lady, as you
12 931 are mine, I am yours, I giue away my selfe for you, and
12 932 doat vpon the exchange
12 933 
12 934    Beat. Speake cosin, or (if you cannot) stop his mouth
12 935 with a kisse, and let not him speake neither
12 936 
12 937    Pedro. In faith Lady you haue a merry heart
12 938 
12 939    Beatr. Yea my Lord I thanke it, poore foole it keepes
12 940 on the windy side of Care, my coosin tells him in his eare
12 941 that he is in my heart
12 942 
12 943    Clau. And so she doth coosin
12 944 
12 945    Beat. Good Lord for alliance: thus goes euery one
12 946 to the world but I, and I am sun-burn'd, I may sit in a corner
12 947 and cry, heigh ho for a husband
12 948 
12 949    Pedro. Lady Beatrice, I will get you one
12 950 
12 951    Beat. I would rather haue one of your fathers getting:
12 952 hath your Grace ne're a brother like you? your father
12 953 got excellent husbands, if a maid could come by them
12 954 
12 955    Prince. Will you haue me? Lady
12 956 
12 957    Beat. No, my Lord, vnlesse I might haue another for
12 958 working-daies, your Grace is too costly to weare euerie
12 959 day: but I beseech your Grace pardon mee, I was borne
12 960 to speake all mirth, and no matter
12 961 
12 962    Prince. Your silence most offends me, and to be merry,
12 963 best becomes you, for out of question, you were born
12 964 in a merry howre
12 965 
12 966    Beatr. No sure my Lord, my Mother cried, but then
12 967 there was a starre daunst, and vnder that was I borne: cosins
12 968 God giue you ioy
12 969 
12 970    Leonato. Neece, will you looke to those things I told
12 971 you of?
12 972   Beat. I cry you mercy Vncle, by your Graces pardon.
12 973 
12 974 Exit Beatrice.
12 975 
12 976   Prince. By my troth a pleasant spirited Lady
12 977 
12 978    Leon. There's little of the melancholy element in her
12 979 my Lord, she is neuer sad, but when she sleepes, and not
12 980 euer sad then: for I haue heard my daughter say, she hath
12 981 often dreamt of vnhappinesse, and wakt her selfe with
12 982 laughing
12 983 
12 984    Pedro. Shee cannot indure to heare tell of a husband
12 985 
12 986    Leonato. O, by no meanes, she mocks all her wooers
12 987 out of suite
12 988 
12 989    Prince. She were an excellent wife for Benedick
12 990 
12 991    Leonato. O Lord, my Lord, if they were but a weeke
12 992 married, they would talke themselues madde
12 993 
12 994    Prince. Counte Claudio, when meane you to goe to
12 995 Church?
12 996   Clau. To morrow my Lord, Time goes on crutches,
12 997 till Loue haue all his rites
12 998 
12 999    Leonato. Not till monday, my deare sonne, which is
12 1000 hence a iust seuen night, and a time too briefe too, to haue
12 1001 all things answer minde
12 1002 
12 1003    Prince. Come, you shake the head at so long a breathing,
12 1004 but I warrant thee Claudio, the time shall not goe
12 1005 dully by vs, I will in the interim, vndertake one of Hercules
12 1006 labors, which is, to bring Signior Benedicke and the
12 1007 Lady Beatrice into a mountaine of affection, th' one with
12 1008 th' other, I would faine haue it a match, and I doubt not
12 1009 but to fashion it, if you three will but minister such assistance
12 1010 as I shall giue you direction
12 1011 
12 1012    Leonato. My Lord, I am for you, though it cost mee
12 1013 ten nights watchings
12 1014 
12 1015    Claud. And I my Lord
12 1016 
12 1017    Prin. And you to gentle Hero?
12 1018   Hero. I will doe any modest office, my Lord, to helpe
12 1019 my cosin to a good husband
12 1020 
12 1021    Prin. And Benedick is not the vnhopefullest husband
12 1022 that I know: thus farre can I praise him, hee is of a noble
12 1023 straine, of approued valour, and confirm'd honesty, I will
12 1024 teach you how to humour your cosin, that shee shall fall
12 1025 in loue with Benedicke, and I, with your two helpes, will
12 1026 so practise on Benedicke, that in despight of his quicke
12 1027 wit, and his queasie stomacke, hee shall fall in loue with
12 1028 Beatrice: if wee can doe this, Cupid is no longer an Archer,
12 1029 his glory shall be ours, for wee are the onely louegods,
12 1030 goe in with me, and I will tell you my drift.
12 1031 Enter.
12 1032 
12 1033 Enter Iohn and Borachio.
12 1034 
12 1035   Ioh. It is so, the Count Claudio shal marry the daughter
12 1036 of Leonato
12 1037 
12 1038    Bora. Yea my Lord, but I can crosse it
12 1039 
12 1040    Iohn. Any barre, any crosse, any impediment, will be
12 1041 medicinable to me, I am sicke in displeasure to him, and
12 1042 whatsoeuer comes athwart his affection, ranges euenly
12 1043 with mine, how canst thou crosse this marriage?
12 1044   Bor. Not honestly my Lord, but so couertly, that no
12 1045 dishonesty shall appeare in me
12 1046 
12 1047    Iohn. Shew me breefely how
12 1048 
12 1049    Bor. I thinke I told your Lordship a yeere since, how
12 1050 much I am in the fauour of Margaret, the waiting gentlewoman
12 1051 to Hero
12 1052 
12 1053    Iohn. I remember
12 1054 
12 1055    Bor. I can at any vnseasonable instant of the night,
12 1056 appoint her to looke out at her Ladies chamber window
12 1057 
12 1058    Iohn. What life is in that, to be the death of this marriage?
12 1059   Bor. The poyson of that lies in you to temper, goe
12 1060 you to the Prince your brother, spare not to tell him, that
12 1061 hee hath wronged his Honor in marrying the renowned
12 1062 Claudio, whose estimation do you mightily hold vp, to a
12 1063 contaminated stale, such a one as Hero
12 1064 
12 1065    Iohn. What proofe shall I make of that?
12 1066   Bor. Proofe enough, to misuse the Prince, to vexe
12 1067 Claudio, to vndoe Hero, and kill Leonato, looke you for any
12 1068 other issue?
12 1069   Iohn. Onely to despight them, I will endeauour any
12 1070 thing
12 1071 
12 1072    Bor. Goe then, finde me a meete howre, to draw on
12 1073 Pedro and the Count Claudio alone, tell them that you
12 1074 know that Hero loues me, intend a kinde of zeale both
12 1075 to the Prince and Claudio (as in a loue of your brothers
12 1076 honor who hath made this match) and his friends reputation,
12 1077 who is thus like to be cosen'd with the semblance
12 1078 of a maid, that you haue discouer'd thus: they will scarcely
12 1079 beleeue this without triall: offer them instances which
12 1080 shall beare no lesse likelihood, than to see mee at her
12 1081 chamber window, heare me call Margaret, Hero; heare
12 1082 Margaret terme me Claudio, and bring them to see this
12 1083 the very night before the intended wedding, for in the
12 1084 meane time, I will so fashion the matter, that Hero shall
12 1085 be absent, and there shall appeare such seeming truths of
12 1086 Heroes disloyaltie, that iealousie shall be cal'd assurance,
12 1087 and all the preparation ouerthrowne
12 1088 
12 1089    Iohn. Grow this to what aduerse issue it can, I will
12 1090 put it in practise: be cunning in the working this, and
12 1091 thy fee is a thousand ducates
12 1092 
12 1093    Bor. Be thou constant in the accusation, and my cunning
12 1094 shall not shame me
12 1095 
12 1096    Iohn. I will presentlie goe learne their day of marriage.
12 1097 Enter.
12 1098 
12 1099 Enter Benedicke alone.
12 1100 
12 1101   Bene. Boy
12 1102 
12 1103    Boy. Signior
12 1104 
12 1105    Bene. In my chamber window lies a booke, bring it
12 1106 hither to me in the orchard
12 1107 
12 1108    Boy. I am heere already sir.
12 1109 Enter.
12 1110 
12 1111   Bene. I know that, but I would haue thee hence, and
12 1112 heere againe. I doe much wonder, that one man seeing
12 1113 how much another man is a foole, when he dedicates his
12 1114 behauiours to loue, will after hee hath laught at such
12 1115 shallow follies in others, become the argument of his
12 1116 owne scorne, by falling in loue, & such a man is Claudio.
12 1117 I haue known when there was no musicke with him but
12 1118 the drum and the fife, and now had hee rather heare the
12 1119 taber and the pipe: I haue knowne when he would haue
12 1120 walkt ten mile afoot, to see a good armor, and now will
12 1121 he lie ten nights awake caruing the fashion of a new dublet:
12 1122 he was wont to speake plaine, & to the purpose (like
12 1123 an honest man & a souldier) and now is he turn'd orthography,
12 1124 his words are a very fantasticall banquet, iust so
12 1125 many strange dishes: may I be so conuerted, & see with
12 1126 these eyes? I cannot tell, I thinke not: I will not bee
12 1127 sworne, but loue may transforme me to an oyster, but Ile
12 1128 take my oath on it, till he haue made an oyster of me, he
12 1129 shall neuer make me such a foole: one woman is faire, yet
12 1130 I am well: another is wise, yet I am well: another vertuous,
12 1131 yet I am well: but till all graces be in one woman,
12 1132 one woman shall not come in my grace: rich shee shall
12 1133 be, that's certaine: wise, or Ile none: vertuous, or Ile neuer
12 1134 cheapen her: faire, or Ile neuer looke on her: milde,
12 1135 or come not neere me: Noble, or not for an Angell: of
12 1136 good discourse: an excellent Musitian, and her haire shal
12 1137 be of what colour it please God, hah! the Prince and
12 1138 Monsieur Loue, I will hide me in the Arbor.
12 1139 Enter Prince, Leonato, Claudio, and Iacke Wilson.
12 1140 
12 1141   Prin. Come, shall we heare this musicke?
12 1142   Claud. Yea my good Lord: how still the euening is.
12 1143 As husht on purpose to grace harmonie
12 1144 
12 1145    Prin. See you where Benedicke hath hid himselfe?
12 1146   Clau. O very well my Lord: the musicke ended,
12 1147 Wee'll fit the kid-foxe with a penny worth
12 1148 
12 1149    Prince. Come Balthasar, wee'll heare that song again
12 1150 
12 1151    Balth. O good my Lord, taxe not so bad a voyce,
12 1152 To slander musicke any more then once
12 1153 
12 1154    Prin. It is the witnesse still of excellency,
12 1155 To slander Musicke any more then once
12 1156 
12 1157    Prince. It is the witnesse still of excellencie,
12 1158 To put a strange face on his owne perfection,
12 1159 I pray thee sing, and let me woe no more
12 1160 
12 1161    Balth. Because you talke of wooing, I will sing,
12 1162 Since many a wooer doth commence his suit,
12 1163 To her he thinkes not worthy, yet he wooes,
12 1164 Yet will he sweare he loues
12 1165 
12 1166    Prince. Nay pray thee come,
12 1167 Or if thou wilt hold longer argument,
12 1168 Doe it in notes
12 1169 
12 1170    Balth. Note this before my notes,
12 1171 Theres not a note of mine that's worth the noting
12 1172 
12 1173    Prince. Why these are very crotchets that he speaks,
12 1174 Note notes forsooth, and nothing
12 1175 
12 1176    Bene. Now diuine aire, now is his soule rauisht, is it
12 1177 not strange that sheepes guts should hale soules out of
12 1178 mens bodies? well, a horne for my money when all's
12 1179 done.
12 1180 
12 1181 The Song.
12 1182 
12 1183 Sigh no more Ladies, sigh no more,
12 1184 Men were deceiuers euer,
12 1185 One foote in Sea, and one on shore,
12 1186 To one thing constant neuer,
12 1187 Then sigh not so, but let them goe,
12 1188 And be you blithe and bonnie,
12 1189 Conuerting all your sounds of woe,
12 1190 Into hey nony nony.
12 1191 Sing no more ditties, sing no moe,
12 1192 Of dumps so dull and heauy,
12 1193 The fraud of men were euer so,
12 1194 Since summer first was leauy,
12 1195 Then sigh not so, &c
12 1196 
12 1197    Prince. By my troth a good song
12 1198 
12 1199    Balth. And an ill singer, my Lord
12 1200 
12 1201    Prince. Ha, no, no faith, thou singst well enough for a
12 1202 shift
12 1203 
12 1204    Ben. And he had been a dog that should haue howld
12 1205 thus, they would haue hang'd him, and I pray God his
12 1206 bad voyce bode no mischiefe, I had as liefe haue heard
12 1207 the night-rauen, come what plague could haue come after
12 1208 it
12 1209 
12 1210    Prince. Yea marry, dost thou heare Balthasar? I pray
12 1211 thee get vs some excellent musick: for to morrow night
12 1212 we would haue it at the Lady Heroes chamber window
12 1213 
12 1214    Balth. The best I can, my Lord.
12 1215 
12 1216 Exit Balthasar.
12 1217 
12 1218   Prince. Do so, farewell. Come hither Leonato, what
12 1219 was it you told me of to day, that your Niece Beatrice
12 1220 was in loue with signior Benedicke?
12 1221   Cla. O I, stalke on, stalke on, the foule sits. I did neuer
12 1222 thinke that Lady would haue loued any man
12 1223 
12 1224    Leon. No, nor I neither, but most wonderful, that she
12 1225 should so dote on Signior Benedicke, whom shee hath in
12 1226 all outward behauiours seemed euer to abhorre
12 1227 
12 1228    Bene. Is't possible? sits the winde in that corner?
12 1229   Leo. By my troth my Lord, I cannot tell what to
12 1230 thinke of it, but that she loues him with an inraged affection,
12 1231 it is past the infinite of thought
12 1232 
12 1233    Prince. May be she doth but counterfeit
12 1234 
12 1235    Claud. Faith like enough
12 1236 
12 1237    Leon. O God! counterfeit? there was neuer counterfeit
12 1238 of passion, came so neere the life of passion as she discouers
12 1239 it
12 1240 
12 1241    Prince. Why what effects of passion shewes she?
12 1242   Claud. Baite the hooke well, this fish will bite
12 1243 
12 1244    Leon. What effects my Lord? shee will sit you, you
12 1245 heard my daughter tell you how
12 1246 
12 1247    Clau. She did indeed
12 1248 
12 1249    Prince. How, how I pray you? you amaze me, I would
12 1250 haue thought her spirit had beene inuincible against all
12 1251 assaults of affection
12 1252 
12 1253    Leo. I would haue sworne it had, my Lord, especially
12 1254 against Benedicke
12 1255 
12 1256    Bene. I should thinke this a gull, but that the whitebearded
12 1257 fellow speakes it: knauery cannot sure hide
12 1258 himselfe in such reuerence
12 1259 
12 1260    Claud. He hath tane th' infection, hold it vp
12 1261 
12 1262    Prince. Hath shee made her affection known to Benedicke:
12 1263   Leonato. No, and sweares she neuer will, that's her
12 1264 torment
12 1265 
12 1266    Claud. 'Tis true indeed, so your daughter saies: shall
12 1267 I, saies she, that haue so oft encountred him with scorne,
12 1268 write to him that I loue him?
12 1269   Leo. This saies shee now when shee is beginning to
12 1270 write to him, for shee'll be vp twenty times a night, and
12 1271 there will she sit in her smocke, till she haue writ a sheet
12 1272 of paper: my daughter tells vs all
12 1273 
12 1274    Clau. Now you talke of a sheet of paper, I remember
12 1275 a pretty iest your daughter told vs of
12 1276 
12 1277    Leon. O when she had writ it, & was reading it ouer,
12 1278 she found Benedicke and Beatrice betweene the sheete
12 1279 
12 1280    Clau. That
12 1281 
12 1282    Leon. O she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence,
12 1283 raild at her self, that she should be so immodest to write,
12 1284 to one that shee knew would flout her: I measure him,
12 1285 saies she, by my owne spirit, for I should flout him if hee
12 1286 writ to mee, yea though I loue him, I should
12 1287 
12 1288    Clau. Then downe vpon her knees she falls, weepes,
12 1289 sobs, beates her heart, teares her hayre, praies, curses, O
12 1290 sweet Benedicke, God giue me patience
12 1291 
12 1292    Leon. She doth indeed, my daughter saies so, and the
12 1293 extasie hath so much ouerborne her, that my daughter is
12 1294 somtime afeard she will doe a desperate out-rage to her
12 1295 selfe, it is very true
12 1296 
12 1297    Prince. It were good that Benedicke knew of it by some
12 1298 other, if she will not discouer it
12 1299 
12 1300    Clau. To what end? he would but make a sport of it,
12 1301 and torment the poore Lady worse
12 1302 
12 1303    Prin. And he should, it were an almes to hang him,
12 1304 shee's an excellent sweet Lady, and (out of all suspition,)
12 1305 she is vertuous
12 1306 
12 1307    Claudio. And she is exceeding wise
12 1308 
12 1309    Prince. In euery thing, but in louing Benedicke
12 1310 
12 1311    Leon. O my Lord, wisedome and bloud combating in
12 1312 so tender a body, we haue ten proofes to one, that bloud
12 1313 hath the victory, I am sorry for her, as I haue iust cause,
12 1314 being her Vncle, and her Guardian
12 1315 
12 1316    Prince. I would shee had bestowed this dotage on
12 1317 mee, I would haue daft all other respects, and made her
12 1318 halfe my selfe: I pray you tell Benedicke of it, and heare
12 1319 what he will say
12 1320 
12 1321    Leon. Were it good thinke you?
12 1322   Clau. Hero thinkes surely she wil die, for she saies she
12 1323 will die, if hee loue her not, and shee will die ere shee
12 1324 make her loue knowne, and she will die if hee wooe her,
12 1325 rather than shee will bate one breath of her accustomed
12 1326 crossenesse
12 1327 
12 1328    Prince. She doth well, if she should make tender of her
12 1329 loue, 'tis very possible hee'l scorne it, for the man (as you
12 1330 know all) hath a contemptible spirit
12 1331 
12 1332    Clau. He is a very proper man
12 1333 
12 1334    Prin. He hath indeed a good outward happines
12 1335 
12 1336    Clau. 'Fore God, and in my minde very wise
12 1337 
12 1338    Prin. He doth indeed shew some sparkes that are like
12 1339 wit
12 1340 
12 1341    Leon. And I take him to be valiant
12 1342 
12 1343    Prin. As Hector, I assure you, and in the managing of
12 1344 quarrels you may see hee is wise, for either hee auoydes
12 1345 them with great discretion, or vndertakes them with a
12 1346 Christian-like feare
12 1347 
12 1348    Leon. If hee doe feare God, a must necessarilie keepe
12 1349 peace, if hee breake the peace, hee ought to enter into a
12 1350 quarrell with feare and trembling
12 1351 
12 1352    Prin. And so will he doe, for the man doth fear God,
12 1353 howsoeuer it seemes not in him, by some large ieasts hee
12 1354 will make: well, I am sorry for your niece, shall we goe
12 1355 see Benedicke, and tell him of her loue
12 1356 
12 1357    Claud. Neuer tell him, my Lord, let her weare it out
12 1358 with good counsell
12 1359 
12 1360    Leon. Nay that's impossible, she may weare her heart
12 1361 out first
12 1362 
12 1363    Prin. Well, we will heare further of it by your daughter,
12 1364 let it coole the while, I loue Benedicke well, and I
12 1365 could wish he would modestly examine himselfe, to see
12 1366 how much he is vnworthy to haue so good a Lady
12 1367 
12 1368    Leon. My Lord, will you walke? dinner is ready
12 1369 
12 1370    Clau. If he do not doat on her vpon this, I wil neuer
12 1371 trust my expectation
12 1372 
12 1373    Prin. Let there be the same Net spread for her, and
12 1374 that must your daughter and her gentlewoman carry:
12 1375 the sport will be, when they hold one an opinion of anothers
12 1376 dotage, and no such matter, that's the Scene that I
12 1377 would see, which will be meerely a dumbe shew: let vs
12 1378 send her to call him into dinner.
12 1379 
12 1380 Exeunt.
12 1381 
12 1382   Bene. This can be no tricke, the conference was sadly
12 1383 borne, they haue the truth of this from Hero, they seeme
12 1384 to pittie the Lady: it seemes her affections haue the full
12 1385 bent: loue me? why it must be requited: I heare how I
12 1386 am censur'd, they say I will beare my selfe proudly, if I
12 1387 perceiue the loue come from her: they say too, that she
12 1388 will rather die than giue any signe of affection: I did neuer
12 1389 thinke to marry, I must not seeme proud, happy are
12 1390 they that heare their detractions, and can put them to
12 1391 mending: they say the Lady is faire, 'tis a truth, I can
12 1392 beare them witnesse: and vertuous, tis so, I cannot reprooue
12 1393 it, and wise, but for louing me, by my troth it is
12 1394 no addition to her witte, nor no great argument of her
12 1395 folly; for I wil be horribly in loue with her, I may chance
12 1396 haue some odde quirkes and remnants of witte broken
12 1397 on mee, because I haue rail'd so long against marriage:
12 1398 but doth not the appetite alter? a man loues the meat in
12 1399 his youth, that he cannot indure in his age. Shall quips
12 1400 and sentences, and these paper bullets of the braine awe
12 1401 a man from the careere of his humour? No, the world
12 1402 must be peopled. When I said I would die a batcheler, I
12 1403 did not think I should liue till I were maried, here comes
12 1404 Beatrice: by this day, shee's a faire Lady, I doe spie some
12 1405 markes of loue in her.
12 1406 Enter Beatrice.
12 1407 
12 1408   Beat. Against my wil I am sent to bid you come in to
12 1409 dinner
12 1410 
12 1411    Bene. Faire Beatrice, I thanke you for your paines
12 1412 
12 1413    Beat. I tooke no more paines for those thankes, then
12 1414 you take paines to thanke me, if it had been painefull, I
12 1415 would not haue come
12 1416 
12 1417    Bene. You take pleasure then in the message
12 1418 
12 1419    Beat. Yea iust so much as you may take vpon a kniues
12 1420 point, and choake a daw withall: you haue no stomacke
12 1421 signior, fare you well.
12 1422 Enter.
12 1423 
12 1424   Bene. Ha, against my will I am sent to bid you come
12 1425 into dinner: there's a double meaning in that: I tooke
12 1426 no more paines for those thankes then you took paines
12 1427 to thanke me, that's as much as to say, any paines that I
12 1428 take for you is as easie as thankes: if I do not take pitty
12 1429 of her I am a villaine, if I doe not loue her I am a Iew, I
12 1430 will goe get her picture.
12 1431 Enter.
12 1432 
12 1433 
12 1434 Actus Tertius.
12 1435 
12 1436 Enter Hero and two Gentlemen, Margaret, and Vrsula.
12 1437 
12 1438   Hero. Good Margaret runne thee to the parlour,
12 1439 There shalt thou finde my Cosin Beatrice,
12 1440 Proposing with the Prince and Claudio,
12 1441 Whisper her eare, and tell her I and Vrsula,
12 1442 Walke in the Orchard, and our whole discourse
12 1443 Is all of her, say that thou ouer-heardst vs,
12 1444 And bid her steale into the pleached bower,
12 1445 Where hony-suckles ripened by the sunne,
12 1446 Forbid the sunne to enter: like fauourites,
12 1447 Made proud by Princes, that aduance their pride,
12 1448 Against that power that bred it, there will she hide her,
12 1449 To listen our purpose, this is thy office,
12 1450 Beare thee well in it, and leaue vs alone
12 1451 
12 1452    Marg. Ile make her come I warrant you presently
12 1453 
12 1454    Hero. Now Vrsula, when Beatrice doth come,
12 1455 As we do trace this alley vp and downe,
12 1456 Our talke must onely be of Benedicke,
12 1457 When I doe name him, let it be thy part,
12 1458 To praise him more then euer man did merit,
12 1459 My talke to thee must be how Benedicke
12 1460 Is sicke in loue with Beatrice; of this matter,
12 1461 Is little Cupids crafty arrow made,
12 1462 That onely wounds by heare-say: now begin,
12 1463 Enter Beatrice.
12 1464 
12 1465 For looke where Beatrice like a Lapwing runs
12 1466 Close by the ground, to heare our conference
12 1467 
12 1468    Vrs. The pleasant'st angling is to see the fish
12 1469 Cut with her golden ores the siluer streame,
12 1470 And greedily deuoure the treacherous baite:
12 1471 So angle we for Beatrice, who euen now,
12 1472 Is couched in the wood-bine couerture,
12 1473 Feare you not my part of the Dialogue
12 1474 
12 1475    Her. Then go we neare her that her eare loose nothing,
12 1476 Of the false sweete baite that we lay for it:
12 1477 No truely Vrsula, she is too disdainfull,
12 1478 I know her spirits are as coy and wilde,
12 1479 As Haggerds of the rocke
12 1480 
12 1481    Vrsula. But are you sure,
12 1482 That Benedicke loues Beatrice so intirely?
12 1483   Her. So saies the Prince, and my new trothed Lord
12 1484 
12 1485    Vrs. And did they bid you tell her of it, Madam?
12 1486   Her. They did intreate me to acquaint her of it,
12 1487 But I perswaded them, if they lou'd Benedicke,
12 1488 To wish him wrastle with affection,
12 1489 And neuer to let Beatrice know of it
12 1490 
12 1491    Vrsula. Why did you so, doth not the Gentleman
12 1492 Deserue as full as fortunate a bed,
12 1493 As euer Beatrice shall couch vpon?
12 1494   Hero. O God of loue! I know he doth deserue,
12 1495 As much as may be yeelded to a man:
12 1496 But Nature neuer fram'd a womans heart,
12 1497 Of prowder stuffe then that of Beatrice:
12 1498 Disdaine and Scorne ride sparkling in her eyes,
12 1499 Mis-prizing what they looke on, and her wit
12 1500 Values it selfe so highly, that to her
12 1501 All matter else seemes weake: she cannot loue,
12 1502 Nor take no shape nor proiect of affection,
12 1503 Shee is so selfe indeared
12 1504 
12 1505    Vrsula. Sure I thinke so,
12 1506 And therefore certainely it were not good
12 1507 She knew his loue, lest she make sport at it
12 1508 
12 1509    Hero. Why you speake truth, I neuer yet saw man,
12 1510 How wise, how noble, yong, how rarely featur'd.
12 1511 But she would spell him backward: if faire fac'd,
12 1512 She would sweare the gentleman should be her sister:
12 1513 If blacke, why Nature drawing of an anticke,
12 1514 Made a foule blot: if tall, a launce ill headed:
12 1515 If low, an agot very vildlie cut:
12 1516 If speaking, why a vane blowne with all windes:
12 1517 If silent, why a blocke moued with none.
12 1518 So turnes she euery man the wrong side out,
12 1519 And neuer giues to Truth and Vertue, that
12 1520 Which simplenesse and merit purchaseth
12 1521 
12 1522    Vrsu. Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable
12 1523 
12 1524    Hero. No, not to be so odde, and from all fashions,
12 1525 As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable,
12 1526 But who dare tell her so? if I should speake,
12 1527 She would mocke me into ayre, O she would laugh me
12 1528 Out of my selfe, presse me to death with wit,
12 1529 Therefore let Benedicke like couered fire,
12 1530 Consume away in sighes, waste inwardly:
12 1531 It were a better death, to die with mockes,
12 1532 Which is as bad as die with tickling
12 1533 
12 1534    Vrsu. Yet tell her of it, heare what shee will say
12 1535 
12 1536    Hero. No, rather I will goe to Benedicke,
12 1537 And counsaile him to fight against his passion,
12 1538 And truly Ile deuise some honest slanders,
12 1539 To staine my cosin with, one doth not know,
12 1540 How much an ill word may impoison liking
12 1541 
12 1542    Vrsu. O doe not doe your cosin such a wrong,
12 1543 She cannot be so much without true iudgement,
12 1544 Hauing so swift and excellent a wit
12 1545 As she is prisde to haue, as to refuse
12 1546 So rare a Gentleman as signior Benedicke
12 1547 
12 1548    Hero. He is the onely man of Italy,
12 1549 Alwaies excepted, my deare Claudio
12 1550 
12 1551    Vrsu. I pray you be not angry with me, Madame,
12 1552 Speaking my fancy: Signior Benedicke,
12 1553 For shape, for bearing argument and valour,
12 1554 Goes formost in report through Italy
12 1555 
12 1556    Hero. Indeed he hath an excellent good name
12 1557 
12 1558    Vrsu. His excellence did earne it ere he had it:
12 1559 When are you married Madame?
12 1560   Hero. Why euerie day to morrow, come goe in,
12 1561 Ile shew thee some attires, and haue thy counsell,
12 1562 Which is the best to furnish me to morrow
12 1563 
12 1564    Vrsu. Shee's tane I warrant you,
12 1565 We haue caught her Madame?
12 1566   Hero. If it proue so, then louing goes by haps,
12 1567 Some Cupid kills with arrowes, some with traps.
12 1568 Enter.
12 1569 
12 1570   Beat. What fire is in mine eares? can this be true?
12 1571 Stand I condemn'd for pride and scorne so much?
12 1572 Contempt, farewell, and maiden pride, adew,
12 1573 No glory liues behinde the backe of such.
12 1574 And Benedicke, loue on, I will requite thee,
12 1575 Taming my wilde heart to thy louing hand:
12 1576 If thou dost loue, my kindnesse shall incite thee
12 1577 To binde our loues vp in a holy band.
12 1578 For others say thou dost deserue, and I
12 1579 Beleeue it better then reportingly.
12 1580 Enter.
12 1581 
12 1582 Enter Prince, Claudio, Benedicke, and Leonato.
12 1583 
12 1584   Prince. I doe but stay till your marriage be consummate,
12 1585 and then go I toward Arragon
12 1586 
12 1587    Clau. Ile bring you thither my Lord, if you'l vouchsafe
12 1588 me
12 1589 
12 1590    Prin. Nay, that would be as great a soyle in the new
12 1591 glosse of your marriage, as to shew a childe his new coat
12 1592 and forbid him to weare it, I will onely bee bold with
12 1593 Benedicke for his companie, for from the crowne of his
12 1594 head, to the sole of his foot, he is all mirth, he hath twice
12 1595 or thrice cut Cupids bow-string, and the little hang-man
12 1596 dare not shoot at him, he hath a heart as sound as a bell,
12 1597 and his tongue is the clapper, for what his heart thinkes,
12 1598 his tongue speakes
12 1599 
12 1600    Bene. Gallants, I am not as I haue bin
12 1601 
12 1602    Leo. So say I, methinkes you are sadder
12 1603 
12 1604    Claud. I hope he be in loue
12 1605 
12 1606    Prin. Hang him truant, there's no true drop of bloud
12 1607 in him to be truly toucht with loue, if he be sad, he wants
12 1608 money
12 1609 
12 1610    Bene. I haue the tooth-ach
12 1611 
12 1612    Prin. Draw it
12 1613 
12 1614    Bene. Hang it
12 1615 
12 1616    Claud. You must hang it first, and draw it afterwards
12 1617 
12 1618    Prin. What? sigh for the tooth-ach
12 1619 
12 1620    Leon. Where is but a humour or a worme
12 1621 
12 1622    Bene. Well, euery one cannot master a griefe, but hee
12 1623 that has it
12 1624 
12 1625    Clau. Yet say I, he is in loue
12 1626 
12 1627    Prin. There is no appearance of fancie in him, vnlesse
12 1628 it be a fancy that he hath to strange disguises, as to bee a
12 1629 Dutchman to day, a Frenchman to morrow: vnlesse hee
12 1630 haue a fancy to this foolery, as it appeares hee hath, hee
12 1631 is no foole for fancy, as you would haue it to appeare
12 1632 he is
12 1633 
12 1634    Clau. If he be not in loue with some woman, there
12 1635 is no beleeuing old signes, a brushes his hat a mornings,
12 1636 What should that bode?
12 1637   Prin. Hath any man seene him at the Barbers?
12 1638   Clau. No, but the Barbers man hath beene seen with
12 1639 him, and the olde ornament of his cheeke hath alreadie
12 1640 stuft tennis balls
12 1641 
12 1642    Leon. Indeed he lookes yonger than hee did, by the
12 1643 losse of a beard
12 1644 
12 1645    Prin. Nay a rubs himselfe with Ciuit, can you smell
12 1646 him out by that?
12 1647   Clau. That's as much as to say, the sweet youth's in
12 1648 loue
12 1649 
12 1650    Prin. The greatest note of it is his melancholy
12 1651 
12 1652    Clau. And when was he wont to wash his face?
12 1653   Prin. Yea, or to paint himselfe? for the which I heare
12 1654 what they say of him
12 1655 
12 1656    Clau. Nay, but his iesting spirit, which is now crept
12 1657 into a lute-string, and now gouern'd by stops
12 1658 
12 1659    Prin. Indeed that tels a heauy tale for him: conclude,
12 1660 he is in loue
12 1661 
12 1662    Clau. Nay, but I know who loues him
12 1663 
12 1664    Prince. That would I know too, I warrant one that
12 1665 knowes him not
12 1666 
12 1667    Cla. Yes, and his ill conditions, and in despight of all,
12 1668 dies for him
12 1669 
12 1670    Prin. Shee shall be buried with her face vpwards
12 1671 
12 1672    Bene. Yet is this no charme for the tooth-ake, old signior,
12 1673 walke aside with mee, I haue studied eight or nine
12 1674 wise words to speake to you, which these hobby-horses
12 1675 must not heare
12 1676 
12 1677    Prin. For my life to breake with him about Beatrice
12 1678 
12 1679    Clau. 'Tis euen so, Hero and Margaret haue by this
12 1680 played their parts with Beatrice, and then the two Beares
12 1681 will not bite one another when they meete.
12 1682 Enter Iohn the Bastard.
12 1683 
12 1684   Bast. My Lord and brother, God saue you
12 1685 
12 1686    Prin. Good den brother
12 1687 
12 1688    Bast. If your leisure seru'd, I would speake with you
12 1689 
12 1690    Prince. In priuate?
12 1691   Bast. If it please you, yet Count Claudio may heare,
12 1692 for what I would speake of, concernes him
12 1693 
12 1694    Prin. What's the matter?
12 1695   Basta. Meanes your Lordship to be married to morrow?
12 1696   Prin. You know he does
12 1697 
12 1698    Bast. I know not that when he knowes what I know
12 1699 
12 1700    Clau. If there be any impediment, I pray you discouer
12 1701 it
12 1702 
12 1703    Bast. You may thinke I loue you not, let that appeare
12 1704 hereafter, and ayme better at me by that I now will manifest,
12 1705 for my brother (I thinke, he holds you well, and in
12 1706 dearenesse of heart) hath holpe to effect your ensuing
12 1707 marriage: surely sute ill spent, and labour ill bestowed
12 1708 
12 1709    Prin. Why, what's the matter?
12 1710   Bastard. I came hither to tell you, and circumstances
12 1711 shortned, (for she hath beene too long a talking of) the
12 1712 Lady is disloyall
12 1713 
12 1714    Clau. Who Hero?
12 1715   Bast. Euen shee, Leonatoes Hero, your Hero, euery
12 1716 mans Hero
12 1717 
12 1718    Clau. Disloyall?
12 1719   Bast. The word is too good to paint out her wickednesse,
12 1720 I could say she were worse, thinke you of a worse
12 1721 title, and I will fit her to it: wonder not till further warrant:
12 1722 goe but with mee to night, you shal see her chamber
12 1723 window entred, euen the night before her wedding
12 1724 day, if you loue her, then to morrow wed her: But it
12 1725 would better fit your honour to change your minde
12 1726 
12 1727    Claud. May this be so?
12 1728   Princ. I will not thinke it
12 1729 
12 1730    Bast. If you dare not trust that you see, confesse not
12 1731 that you know: if you will follow mee, I will shew you
12 1732 enough, and when you haue seene more, & heard more,
12 1733 proceed accordingly
12 1734 
12 1735    Clau. If I see any thing to night, why I should not
12 1736 marry her to morrow in the congregation, where I shold
12 1737 wedde, there will I shame her
12 1738 
12 1739    Prin. And as I wooed for thee to obtaine her, I will
12 1740 ioyne with thee to disgrace her
12 1741 
12 1742    Bast. I will disparage her no farther, till you are my
12 1743 witnesses, beare it coldly but till night, and let the issue
12 1744 shew it selfe
12 1745 
12 1746    Prin. O day vntowardly turned!
12 1747   Claud. O mischiefe strangelie thwarting!
12 1748   Bastard. O plague right well preuented! so will you
12 1749 say, when you haue seene the sequele.
12 1750 Enter.
12 1751 
12 1752 Enter Dogbery and his compartner with the watch.
12 1753 
12 1754   Dog. Are you good men and true?
12 1755   Verg. Yea, or else it were pitty but they should suffer
12 1756 saluation body and soule
12 1757 
12 1758    Dogb. Nay, that were a punishment too good for
12 1759 them, if they should haue any allegiance in them, being
12 1760 chosen for the Princes watch
12 1761 
12 1762    Verges. Well, giue them their charge, neighbour
12 1763 Dogbery
12 1764 
12 1765    Dog. First, who thinke you the most desartlesse man
12 1766 to be Constable
12 1767 
12 1768    Watch.1. Hugh Ote-cake sir, or George Sea-coale, for
12 1769 they can write and reade
12 1770 
12 1771    Dogb. Come hither neighbour Sea-coale, God hath
12 1772 blest you with a good name: to be a wel-fauoured man,
12 1773 is the gift of Fortune, but to write and reade, comes by
12 1774 Nature
12 1775 
12 1776    Watch 2. Both which Master Constable
12 1777   Dogb. You haue: I knew it would be your answere:
12 1778 well, for your fauour sir, why giue God thankes, & make
12 1779 no boast of it, and for your writing and reading, let that
12 1780 appeare when there is no need of such vanity, you are
12 1781 thought heere to be the most senslesse and fit man for the
12 1782 Constable of the watch: therefore beare you the lanthorne:
12 1783 this is your charge: You shall comprehend all
12 1784 vagrom men, you are to bid any man stand in the Princes
12 1785 name
12 1786 
12 1787    Watch 2. How if a will not stand?
12 1788   Dogb. Why then take no note of him, but let him go,
12 1789 and presently call the rest of the Watch together, and
12 1790 thanke God you are ridde of a knaue
12 1791 
12 1792    Verges. If he will not stand when he is bidden, hee is
12 1793 none of the Princes subiects
12 1794 
12 1795    Dogb. True, and they are to meddle with none but
12 1796 the Princes subiects: you shall also make no noise in the
12 1797 streetes: for, for the Watch to babble and talke, is most
12 1798 tollerable, and not to be indured
12 1799 
12 1800    Watch. We will rather sleepe than talke, wee know
12 1801 what belongs to a Watch
12 1802 
12 1803    Dog. Why you speake like an ancient and most quiet
12 1804 watchman, for I cannot see how sleeping should offend:
12 1805 only haue a care that your bills be not stolne: well, you
12 1806 are to call at all the Alehouses, and bid them that are
12 1807 drunke get them to bed
12 1808 
12 1809    Watch. How if they will not?
12 1810   Dogb. Why then let them alone till they are sober, if
12 1811 they make you not then the better answere, you may say,
12 1812 they are not the men you tooke them for
12 1813 
12 1814    Watch. Well sir,
12 1815   Dogb. If you meet a theefe, you may suspect him, by
12 1816 vertue of your office, to be no true man: and for such
12 1817 kinde of men, the lesse you meddle or make with them,
12 1818 why the more is for your honesty
12 1819 
12 1820    Watch. If wee know him to be a thiefe, shall wee not
12 1821 lay hands on him
12 1822 
12 1823    Dogb. Truly by your office you may, but I think they
12 1824 that touch pitch will be defil'd: the most peaceable way
12 1825 for you, if you doe take a theefe, is, to let him shew himselfe
12 1826 what he is, and steale out of your company
12 1827 
12 1828    Ver. You haue bin alwaies cal'd a merciful ma[n] partner
12 1829 
12 1830    Dog. Truely I would not hang a dog by my will, much
12 1831 more a man who hath anie honestie in him
12 1832 
12 1833    Verges. If you heare a child crie in the night you must
12 1834 call to the nurse, and bid her still it
12 1835 
12 1836    Watch. How if the nurse be asleepe and will not
12 1837 heare vs?
12 1838   Dog. Why then depart in peace, and let the childe
12 1839 wake her with crying, for the ewe that will not heare
12 1840 her Lambe when it baes, will neuer answere a calfe when
12 1841 he bleates
12 1842 
12 1843    Verges. 'Tis verie true
12 1844 
12 1845    Dog. This is the end of the charge: you constable
12 1846 are to present the Princes owne person, if you meete the
12 1847 Prince in the night, you may staie him
12 1848 
12 1849    Verges. Nay birladie that I thinke a cannot
12 1850 
12 1851    Dog. Fiue shillings to one on't with anie man that
12 1852 knowes the Statutes, he may staie him, marrie not without
12 1853 the prince be willing, for indeed the watch ought to
12 1854 offend no man, and it is an offence to stay a man against
12 1855 his will
12 1856 
12 1857    Verges. Birladie I thinke it be so
12 1858 
12 1859    Dog. Ha, ah ha, well masters good night, and there be
12 1860 anie matter of weight chances, call vp me, keepe your
12 1861 fellowes counsailes, and your owne, and good night,
12 1862 come neighbour
12 1863 
12 1864    Watch. Well masters, we heare our charge, let vs go
12 1865 sit here vpon the Church bench till two, and then all to
12 1866 bed
12 1867 
12 1868    Dog. One word more, honest neighbors. I pray you
12 1869 watch about signior Leonatoes doore, for the wedding being
12 1870 there to morrow, there is a great coyle to night,
12 1871 adiew, be vigitant I beseech you.
12 1872 
12 1873 Exeunt.
12 1874 
12 1875 Enter Borachio and Conrade.
12 1876 
12 1877   Bor. What, Conrade?
12 1878   Watch. Peace, stir not
12 1879 
12 1880    Bor. Conrade I say
12 1881 
12 1882    Con. Here man, I am at thy elbow
12 1883 
12 1884    Bor. Mas and my elbow itcht, I thought there would
12 1885 a scabbe follow
12 1886 
12 1887    Con. I will owe thee an answere for that, and now
12 1888 forward with thy tale
12 1889 
12 1890    Bor. Stand thee close then vnder this penthouse, for it
12 1891 drissels raine, and I will, like a true drunkard, vtter all to
12 1892 thee
12 1893 
12 1894    Watch. Some treason masters, yet stand close
12 1895 
12 1896    Bor. Therefore know, I haue earned of Don Iohn a
12 1897 thousand Ducates
12 1898 
12 1899    Con. Is it possible that anie villanie should be so deare?
12 1900   Bor. Thou should'st rather aske if it were possible anie
12 1901 villanie should be so rich? for when rich villains haue
12 1902 neede of poore ones, poore ones may make what price
12 1903 they will
12 1904 
12 1905    Con. I wonder at it
12 1906 
12 1907    Bor. That shewes thou art vnconfirm'd, thou knowest
12 1908 that the fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a cloake, is nothing
12 1909 to a man
12 1910 
12 1911    Con. Yes, it is apparell
12 1912 
12 1913    Bor. I meane the fashion
12 1914 
12 1915    Con. Yes the fashion is the fashion
12 1916 
12 1917    Bor. Tush, I may as well say the foole's the foole, but
12 1918 seest thou not what a deformed theefe this fashion is?
12 1919   Watch. I know that deformed, a has bin a vile theefe,
12 1920 this vii. yeares, a goes vp and downe like a gentle man:
12 1921 I remember his name
12 1922 
12 1923    Bor. Did'st thou not heare some bodie?
12 1924   Con. No, 'twas the vaine on the house
12 1925 
12 1926    Bor. Seest thou not (I say) what a deformed thiefe
12 1927 this fashion is, how giddily a turnes about all the Hotblouds,
12 1928 betweene, foureteene & fiue & thirtie, sometimes
12 1929 fashioning them like Pharaoes souldiours in the rechie
12 1930 painting, sometime like god Bels priests in the old
12 1931 Church window, sometime like the shauen Hercules in
12 1932 the smircht worm-eaten tapestrie, where his cod-peece
12 1933 seemes as massie as his club
12 1934 
12 1935    Con. All this I see, and see that the fashion weares out
12 1936 more apparrell then the man; but art not thou thy selfe
12 1937 giddie with the fashion too that thou hast shifted out of
12 1938 thy tale into telling me of the fashion?
12 1939   Bor. Not so neither, but know that I haue to night
12 1940 wooed Margaret the Lady Heroes gentle-woman, by the
12 1941 name of Hero, she leanes me out at her mistris chamberwindow,
12 1942 bids me a thousand times good night: I tell
12 1943 this tale vildly. I should first tell thee how the Prince
12 1944 Claudio and my Master planted, and placed, and possessed
12 1945 by my Master Don Iohn, saw a far off in the Orchard this
12 1946 amiable incounter
12 1947 
12 1948    Con. And thought thy Margaret was Hero?
12 1949   Bor. Two of them did, the Prince and Claudio, but the
12 1950 diuell my Master knew she was Margaret and partly by
12 1951 his oathes, which first possest them, partly by the darke
12 1952 night which did deceiue them, but chiefely, by my villanie,
12 1953 which did confirme any slander that Don Iohn had
12 1954 made, away went Claudio enraged, swore hee would
12 1955 meete her as he was apointed next morning at the Temple,
12 1956 and there, before the whole congregation shame her
12 1957 with what he saw o're night, and send her home againe
12 1958 without a husband
12 1959 
12 1960    Watch.1. We charge you in the Princes name stand
12 1961 
12 1962    Watch.2. Call vp the right master Constable, we haue
12 1963 here recouered the most dangerous peece of lechery, that
12 1964 euer was knowne in the Common-wealth
12 1965 
12 1966    Watch.1. And one Deformed is one of them, I know
12 1967 him, a weares a locke
12 1968 
12 1969    Conr. Masters, masters
12 1970 
12 1971    Watch.2. Youle be made bring deformed forth I warrant
12 1972 you,
12 1973   Conr. Masters, neuer speake, we charge you, let vs obey
12 1974 you to goe with vs
12 1975 
12 1976    Bor. We are like to proue a goodly commoditie, being
12 1977 taken vp of these mens bils
12 1978 
12 1979    Conr. A commoditie in question I warrant you, come
12 1980 weele obey you.
12 1981 
12 1982 Exeunt.
12 1983 
12 1984 Enter Hero, and Margaret, and Vrsula.
12 1985 
12 1986   Hero. Good Vrsula wake my cosin Beatrice, and desire
12 1987 her to rise
12 1988 
12 1989    Vrsu. I will Lady
12 1990 
12 1991    Her. And bid her come hither
12 1992 
12 1993    Vrs. Well
12 1994 
12 1995    Mar. Troth I thinke your other rebato were better
12 1996 
12 1997    Hero. No pray thee good Meg, Ile weare this
12 1998 
12 1999    Marg. By my troth's not so good, and I warrant your
12 2000 cosin will say so
12 2001 
12 2002    Hero. My cosin's a foole, and thou art another, ile
12 2003 weare none but this
12 2004 
12 2005    Mar. I like the new tire within excellently, if the
12 2006 haire were a thought browner: and your gown's a most
12 2007 rare fashion yfaith, I saw the Dutchesse of Millaines
12 2008 gowne that they praise so
12 2009 
12 2010    Hero. O that exceedes they say
12 2011 
12 2012    Mar. By my troth's but a night-gowne in respect of
12 2013 yours, cloth a gold and cuts, and lac'd with siluer, set with
12 2014 pearles, downe sleeues, side sleeues, and skirts, round vnderborn
12 2015 with a blewish tinsel, but for a fine queint gracefull
12 2016 and excellent fashion, yours is worth ten on't
12 2017 
12 2018    Hero. God giue mee ioy to weare it, for my heart is
12 2019 exceeding heauy
12 2020 
12 2021    Marga. 'Twill be heauier soone, by the waight of a
12 2022 man
12 2023 
12 2024    Hero. Fie vpon thee, art not asham'd?
12 2025   Marg. Of what Lady? of speaking honourably? is
12 2026 not marriage honourable in a beggar? is not your Lord
12 2027 honourable without marriage? I thinke you would haue
12 2028 me say, sauing your reuerence a husband: and bad thinking
12 2029 doe not wrest true speaking, Ile offend no body, is
12 2030 there any harme in the heauier for a husband? none I
12 2031 thinke, and it be the right husband, and the right wife,
12 2032 otherwise 'tis light and not heauy, aske my Lady Beatrice
12 2033 else, here she comes.
12 2034 Enter Beatrice.
12 2035 
12 2036   Hero. Good morrow Coze
12 2037 
12 2038    Beat. Good morrow sweet Hero
12 2039 
12 2040    Hero. Why how now? do you speake in the sick tune?
12 2041   Beat. I am out of all other tune, me thinkes
12 2042 
12 2043    Mar. Claps into Light a loue, (that goes without a
12 2044 burden,) do you sing it and Ile dance it
12 2045 
12 2046    Beat. Ye Light aloue with your heeles, then if your
12 2047 husband haue stables enough, you'll looke he shall lacke
12 2048 no barnes
12 2049 
12 2050    Mar. O illegitimate construction! I scorne that with
12 2051 my heeles
12 2052 
12 2053    Beat. 'Tis almost fiue a clocke cosin, 'tis time you
12 2054 were ready, by my troth I am exceeding ill, hey ho
12 2055 
12 2056    Mar. For a hauke, a horse, or a husband?
12 2057   Beat. For the letter that begins them all, H
12 2058 
12 2059    Mar. Well, and you be not turn'd Turke, there's no
12 2060 more sayling by the starre
12 2061 
12 2062    Beat. What meanes the foole trow?
12 2063   Mar. Nothing I, but God send euery one their harts
12 2064 desire
12 2065 
12 2066    Hero. These gloues the Count sent mee, they are an
12 2067 excellent perfume
12 2068 
12 2069    Beat. I am stuft cosin, I cannot smell
12 2070 
12 2071    Mar. A maid and stuft! there's goodly catching of
12 2072 colde
12 2073 
12 2074    Beat. O God helpe me, God help me, how long haue
12 2075 you profest apprehension?
12 2076   Mar. Euer since you left it, doth not my wit become
12 2077 me rarely?
12 2078   Beat. It is not seene enough, you should weare it in
12 2079 your cap, by my troth I am sicke
12 2080 
12 2081    Mar. Get you some of this distill'd carduus benedictus
12 2082 and lay it to your heart, it is the onely thing for a qualm
12 2083 
12 2084    Hero. There thou prick'st her with a thissell
12 2085 
12 2086    Beat. Benedictus, why benedictus? you haue some morall
12 2087 in this benedictus
12 2088 
12 2089    Mar. Morall? no by my troth, I haue no morall meaning,
12 2090 I meant plaine holy thissell, you may thinke perchance
12 2091 that I thinke you are in loue, nay birlady I am not
12 2092 such a foole to thinke what I list, nor I list not to thinke
12 2093 what I can, nor indeed, I cannot thinke, if I would thinke
12 2094 my hart out of thinking, that you are in loue, or that you
12 2095 will be in loue, or that you can be in loue: yet Benedicke
12 2096 was such another, and now is he become a man, he swore
12 2097 hee would neuer marry, and yet now in despight of his
12 2098 heart he eates his meat without grudging, and how you
12 2099 may be conuerted I know not, but me thinkes you looke
12 2100 with your eies as other women doe
12 2101 
12 2102    Beat. What pace is this that thy tongue keepes
12 2103 
12 2104    Mar. Not a false gallop.
12 2105 Enter Vrsula.
12 2106 
12 2107   Vrsula. Madam, withdraw, the Prince, the Count, signior
12 2108 Benedicke, Don Iohn, and all the gallants of the
12 2109 towne are come to fetch you to Church
12 2110 
12 2111    Hero. Helpe me to dresse mee good coze, good Meg,
12 2112 good Vrsula.
12 2113 Enter Leonato, and the Constable, and the Headborough.
12 2114 
12 2115   Leonato. What would you with mee, honest neighbour?
12 2116   Const.Dog. Mary sir I would haue some confidence
12 2117 with you, that decernes you nearely
12 2118 
12 2119    Leon. Briefe I pray you, for you see it is a busie time
12 2120 with me
12 2121 
12 2122    Const.Dog. Mary this it is sir
12 2123 
12 2124    Headb. Yes in truth it is sir
12 2125 
12 2126    Leon. What is it my good friends?
12 2127   Con.Do. Goodman Verges sir speakes a little of the
12 2128 matter, an old man sir, and his wits are not so blunt, as
12 2129 God helpe I would desire they were, but infaith honest
12 2130 as the skin betweene his browes
12 2131 
12 2132    Head. Yes I thank God, I am as honest as any man liuing,
12 2133 that is an old man, and no honester then I
12 2134 
12 2135    Con.Dog. Comparisons are odorous, palabras, neighbour
12 2136 Verges
12 2137 
12 2138    Leon. Neighbours, you are tedious
12 2139 
12 2140    Con.Dog. It pleases your worship to say so, but we are
12 2141 the poore Dukes officers, but truely for mine owne part,
12 2142 if I were as tedious as a King I could finde in my heart to
12 2143 bestow it all of your worship
12 2144 
12 2145    Leon. All thy tediousnesse on me, ah?
12 2146   Const.Dog. Yea, and 'twere a thousand times more
12 2147 than 'tis, for I heare as good exclamation on your Worship
12 2148 as of any man in the Citie, and though I bee but a
12 2149 poore man, I am glad to heare it
12 2150 
12 2151    Head. And so am I
12 2152 
12 2153    Leon. I would faine know what you haue to say
12 2154 
12 2155    Head. Marry sir our watch to night, excepting your
12 2156 worships presence, haue tane a couple of as arrant
12 2157 knaues as any in Messina
12 2158 
12 2159    Con.Dog. A good old man sir, hee will be talking as
12 2160 they say, when the age is in, the wit is out, God helpe vs,
12 2161 it is a world to see: well said yfaith neighbour Verges,
12 2162 well, God's a good man, and two men ride of a horse,
12 2163 one must ride behinde, an honest soule yfaith sir, by my
12 2164 troth he is, as euer broke bread, but God is to bee worshipt,
12 2165 all men are not alike, alas good neighbour
12 2166 
12 2167    Leon. Indeed neighbour he comes too short of you
12 2168 
12 2169    Con.Do. Gifts that God giues
12 2170 
12 2171    Leon. I must leaue you
12 2172 
12 2173    Con.Dog. One word sir, our watch sir haue indeede
12 2174 comprehended two aspitious persons, & we would haue
12 2175 them this morning examined before your worship
12 2176 
12 2177    Leon. Take their examination your selfe, and bring it
12 2178 me, I am now in great haste, as may appeare vnto you
12 2179 
12 2180    Const. It shall be suffigance
12 2181 
12 2182    Leon. Drinke some wine ere you goe: fare you well.
12 2183 Enter.
12 2184 
12 2185   Messenger. My Lord, they stay for you to giue your
12 2186 daughter to her husband
12 2187 
12 2188    Leon. Ile wait vpon them, I am ready
12 2189 
12 2190    Dogb. Goe good partner, goe get you to Francis Seacoale,
12 2191 bid him bring his pen and inkehorne to the Gaole:
12 2192 we are now to examine those men
12 2193 
12 2194    Verges. And we must doe it wisely
12 2195 
12 2196    Dogb. Wee will spare for no witte I warrant you:
12 2197 heere's that shall driue some to a non-come, only
12 2198 get the learned writer to set downe our excommunication,
12 2199 and meet me at the Iaile.
12 2200 
12 2201 Exeunt.
12 2202 
12 2203 
12 2204 Actus Quartus.
12 2205 
12 2206 Enter Prince, Bastard, Leonato, Frier, Claudio, Benedicke, Hero,
12 2207 and
12 2208 Beatrice.
12 2209 
12 2210   Leonato. Come Frier Francis, be briefe, onely to the
12 2211 plaine forme of marriage, and you shal recount their particular
12 2212 duties afterwards
12 2213 
12 2214    Fran. You come hither, my Lord, to marry this Lady
12 2215 
12 2216    Clau. No
12 2217 
12 2218    Leo. To be married to her: Frier, you come to marrie
12 2219 her
12 2220 
12 2221    Frier. Lady, you come hither to be married to this
12 2222 Count
12 2223 
12 2224    Hero. I doe
12 2225 
12 2226    Frier. If either of you know any inward impediment
12 2227 why you should not be conioyned, I charge you on your
12 2228 soules to vtter it
12 2229 
12 2230    Claud. Know you anie, Hero?
12 2231   Hero. None my Lord
12 2232 
12 2233    Frier. Know you anie, Count?
12 2234   Leon. I dare make his answer, None
12 2235 
12 2236    Clau. O what men dare do! what men may do! what
12 2237 men daily do!
12 2238   Bene. How now! interiections? why then, some be
12 2239 of laughing, as ha, ha, he
12 2240 
12 2241    Clau. Stand thee by Frier, father, by your leaue,
12 2242 Will you with free and vnconstrained soule
12 2243 Giue me this maid your daughter?
12 2244   Leon. As freely sonne as God did giue her me
12 2245 
12 2246    Cla. And what haue I to giue you back, whose worth
12 2247 May counterpoise this rich and precious gift?
12 2248   Prin. Nothing, vnlesse you render her againe
12 2249 
12 2250    Clau. Sweet Prince, you learn me noble thankfulnes:
12 2251 There Leonato, take her backe againe,
12 2252 Giue not this rotten Orenge to your friend,
12 2253 Shee's but the signe and semblance of her honour:
12 2254 Behold how like a maid she blushes heere!
12 2255 O what authoritie and shew of truth
12 2256 Can cunning sinne couer it selfe withall!
12 2257 Comes not that bloud, as modest euidence,
12 2258 To witnesse simple Vertue? would you not sweare
12 2259 All you that see her, that she were a maide,
12 2260 By these exterior shewes? But she is none:
12 2261 She knowes the heat of a luxurious bed:
12 2262 Her blush is guiltinesse, not modestie
12 2263 
12 2264    Leonato. What doe you meane, my Lord?
12 2265   Clau. Not to be married,
12 2266 Not to knit my soule to an approued wanton
12 2267 
12 2268    Leon. Deere my Lord, if you in your owne proofe,
12 2269 Haue vanquisht the resistance of her youth,
12 2270 And made defeat of her virginitie
12 2271 
12 2272    Clau. I know what you would say: if I haue knowne
12 2273 (her,
12 2274 You will say, she did imbrace me as a husband,
12 2275 And so extenuate the forehand sinne: No Leonato,
12 2276 I neuer tempted her with word too large,
12 2277 But as a brother to his sister, shewed
12 2278 Bashfull sinceritie and comely loue
12 2279 
12 2280    Hero. And seem'd I euer otherwise to you?
12 2281   Clau. Out on thee seeming, I will write against it,
12 2282 You seeme to me as Diane in her Orbe,
12 2283 As chaste as is the budde ere it be blowne:
12 2284 But you are more intemperate in your blood,
12 2285 Than Venus, or those pampred animalls,
12 2286 That rage in sauage sensualitie
12 2287 
12 2288    Hero. Is my Lord well, that he doth speake so wide?
12 2289   Leon. Sweete Prince, why speake not you?
12 2290   Prin. What should I speake?
12 2291 I stand dishonour'd that haue gone about,
12 2292 To linke my deare friend to a common stale
12 2293 
12 2294    Leon. Are these things spoken, or doe I but dreame?
12 2295   Bast. Sir, they are spoken, and these things are true
12 2296 
12 2297    Bene. This lookes not like a nuptiall
12 2298 
12 2299    Hero. True, O God!
12 2300   Clau. Leonato, stand I here?
12 2301 Is this the Prince? is this the Princes brother?
12 2302 Is this face Heroes? are our eies our owne?
12 2303   Leon. All this is so, but what of this my Lord?
12 2304   Clau. Let me but moue one question to your daughter,
12 2305 And by that fatherly and kindly power,
12 2306 That you haue in her, bid her answer truly
12 2307 
12 2308    Leo. I charge thee doe, as thou art my childe
12 2309 
12 2310    Hero. O God defend me how am I beset,
12 2311 What kinde of catechizing call you this?
12 2312   Clau. To make you answer truly to your name
12 2313 
12 2314    Hero. Is it not Hero? who can blot that name
12 2315 With any iust reproach?
12 2316   Claud. Marry that can Hero,
12 2317 Hero it selfe can blot out Heroes vertue.
12 2318 What man was he, talkt with you yesternight,
12 2319 Out at your window betwixt twelue and one?
12 2320 Now if you are a maid, answer to this
12 2321 
12 2322    Hero. I talkt with no man at that howre my Lord
12 2323 
12 2324    Prince. Why then you are no maiden. Leonato,
12 2325 I am sorry you must heare: vpon mine honor,
12 2326 My selfe, my brother, and this grieued Count
12 2327 Did see her, heare her, at that howre last night,
12 2328 Talke with a ruffian at her chamber window,
12 2329 Who hath indeed most like a liberall villaine,
12 2330 Confest the vile encounters they haue had
12 2331 A thousand times in secret
12 2332 
12 2333    Iohn. Fie, fie, they are not to be named my Lord,
12 2334 Not to be spoken of,
12 2335 There is not chastitie enough in language,
12 2336 Without offence to vtter them: thus pretty Lady
12 2337 I am sorry for thy much misgouernment
12 2338 
12 2339    Claud. O Hero! what a Hero hadst thou beene
12 2340 If halfe thy outward graces had beene placed
12 2341 About thy thoughts and counsailes of thy heart?
12 2342 But fare thee well, most foule, most faire, farewell
12 2343 Thou pure impiety, and impious puritie,
12 2344 For thee Ile locke vp all the gates of Loue,
12 2345 And on my eie-lids shall Coniecture hang,
12 2346 To turne all beauty into thoughts of harme,
12 2347 And neuer shall it more be gracious
12 2348 
12 2349    Leon. Hath no mans dagger here a point for me?
12 2350   Beat. Why how now cosin, wherfore sink you down?
12 2351   Bast. Come, let vs go: these things come thus to light,
12 2352 Smother her spirits vp
12 2353 
12 2354    Bene. How doth the Lady?
12 2355   Beat. Dead I thinke, helpe vncle,
12 2356 Hero, why Hero, Vncle, Signor Benedicke, Frier
12 2357 
12 2358    Leonato. O Fate! take not away thy heauy hand,
12 2359 Death is the fairest couer for her shame
12 2360 That may be wisht for
12 2361 
12 2362    Beatr. How now cosin Hero?
12 2363   Fri. Haue comfort Ladie
12 2364 
12 2365    Leon. Dost thou looke vp?
12 2366   Frier. Yea, wherefore should she not?
12 2367   Leon. Wherfore? Why doth not euery earthly thing
12 2368 Cry shame vpon her? Could she heere denie
12 2369 The storie that is printed in her blood?
12 2370 Do not liue Hero, do not ope thine eyes:
12 2371 For did I thinke thou wouldst not quickly die,
12 2372 Thought I thy spirits were stronger then thy shames,
12 2373 My selfe would on the reward of reproaches
12 2374 Strike at thy life. Grieu'd I, I had but one?
12 2375 Chid I, for that at frugal Natures frame?
12 2376 O one too much by thee: why had I one?
12 2377 Why euer was't thou louelie in my eies?
12 2378 Why had I not with charitable hand
12 2379 Tooke vp a beggars issue at my gates,
12 2380 Who smeered thus, and mir'd with infamie,
12 2381 I might haue said, no part of it is mine:
12 2382 This shame deriues it selfe from vnknowne loines,
12 2383 But mine, and mine I lou'd, and mine I prais'd,
12 2384 And mine that I was proud on mine so much,
12 2385 That I my selfe, was to my selfe not mine:
12 2386 Valewing of her, why she, O she is falne
12 2387 Into a pit of Inke, that the wide sea
12 2388 Hath drops too few to wash her cleane againe,
12 2389 And salt too little, which may season giue
12 2390 To her foule tainted flesh
12 2391 
12 2392    Ben. Sir, sir, be patient: for my part, I am so attired
12 2393 in wonder, I know not what to say
12 2394 
12 2395    Bea. O on my soule my cosin is belied
12 2396 
12 2397    Ben. Ladie, were you her bedfellow last night?
12 2398   Bea. No, truly: not although vntill last night,
12 2399 I haue this tweluemonth bin her bedfellow
12 2400 
12 2401    Leon. Confirm'd, confirm'd, O that is stronger made
12 2402 Which was before barr'd vp with ribs of iron.
12 2403 Would the Princes lie, and Claudio lie,
12 2404 Who lou'd her so, that speaking of her foulnesse,
12 2405 Wash'd it with teares? Hence from her, let her die
12 2406 
12 2407    Fri. Heare me a little, for I haue onely bene silent so
12 2408 long, and giuen way vnto this course of fortune, by noting
12 2409 of the Ladie, I haue markt.
12 2410 A thousand blushing apparitions,
12 2411 To start into her face, a thousand innocent shames,
12 2412 In Angel whitenesse beare away those blushes,
12 2413 And in her eie there hath appear'd a fire
12 2414 To burne the errors that these Princes hold
12 2415 Against her maiden truth. Call me a foole,
12 2416 Trust not my reading, nor my obseruations,
12 2417 Which with experimental seale doth warrant
12 2418 The tenure of my booke: trust not my age,
12 2419 My reuerence, calling, nor diuinitie,
12 2420 If this sweet Ladie lye not guiltlesse heere,
12 2421 Vnder some biting error
12 2422 
12 2423    Leo. Friar, it cannot be:
12 2424 Thou seest that all the Grace that she hath left,
12 2425 Is, that she wil not adde to her damnation,
12 2426 A sinne of periury, she not denies it:
12 2427 Why seek'st thou then to couer with excuse,
12 2428 That which appeares in proper nakednesse?
12 2429   Fri. Ladie, what man is he you are accus'd of?
12 2430   Hero. They know that do accuse me, I know none:
12 2431 If I know more of any man aliue
12 2432 Then that which maiden modestie doth warrant,
12 2433 Let all my sinnes lacke mercy. O my Father,
12 2434 Proue you that any man with me conuerst,
12 2435 At houres vnmeete, or that I yesternight
12 2436 Maintain'd the change of words with any creature,
12 2437 Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death
12 2438 
12 2439    Fri. There is some strange misprision in the Princes
12 2440 
12 2441    Ben. Two of them haue the verie bent of honor,
12 2442 And if their wisedomes be misled in this:
12 2443 The practise of it liues in Iohn the bastard,
12 2444 Whose spirits toile in frame of villanies
12 2445 
12 2446    Leo. I know not: if they speake but truth of her,
12 2447 These hands shall teare her: If they wrong her honour,
12 2448 The proudest of them shall wel heare of it.
12 2449 Time hath not yet so dried this bloud of mine,
12 2450 Nor age so eate vp my inuention,
12 2451 Nor Fortune made such hauocke of my meanes,
12 2452 Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,
12 2453 But they shall finde, awak'd in such a kinde,
12 2454 Both strength of limbe, and policie of minde,
12 2455 Ability in meanes, and choise of friends,
12 2456 To quit me of them throughly
12 2457 
12 2458    Fri. Pause awhile:
12 2459 And let my counsell sway you in this case,
12 2460 Your daughter heere the Princesse (left for dead)
12 2461 Let her awhile be secretly kept in,
12 2462 And publish it, that she is dead indeed:
12 2463 Maintaine a mourning ostentation,
12 2464 And on your Families old monument,
12 2465 Hang mournfull Epitaphes, and do all rites,
12 2466 That appertaine vnto a buriall
12 2467 
12 2468    Leon. What shall become of this? What wil this do?
12 2469   Fri. Marry this wel carried, shall on her behalfe,
12 2470 Change slander to remorse, that is some good,
12 2471 But not for that dreame I on this strange course,
12 2472 But on this trauaile looke for greater birth:
12 2473 She dying, as it must be so maintain'd,
12 2474 Vpon the instant that she was accus'd,
12 2475 Shal be lamented, pittied, and excus'd
12 2476 Of euery hearer: for it so fals out,
12 2477 That what we haue, we prize not to the worth,
12 2478 Whiles we enioy it; but being lack'd and lost,
12 2479 Why then we racke the value, then we finde
12 2480 The vertue that possession would not shew vs
12 2481 Whiles it was ours, so will it fare with Claudio:
12 2482 When he shal heare she dyed vpon his words,
12 2483 Th' Idea of her life shal sweetly creepe
12 2484 Into his study of imagination.
12 2485 And euery louely Organ of her life,
12 2486 Shall come apparel'd in more precious habite:
12 2487 More mouing delicate, and ful of life,
12 2488 Into the eye and prospect of his soule
12 2489 Then when she liu'd indeed: then shal he mourne,
12 2490 If euer Loue had interest in his Liuer,
12 2491 And wish he had not so accused her:
12 2492 No, though he thought his accusation true:
12 2493 Let this be so, and doubt not but successe
12 2494 Wil fashion the euent in better shape,
12 2495 Then I can lay it downe in likelihood.
12 2496 But if all ayme but this be leuelld false,
12 2497 The supposition of the Ladies death,
12 2498 Will quench the wonder of her infamie.
12 2499 And if it sort not well, you may conceale her
12 2500 As best befits her wounded reputation,
12 2501 In some reclusiue and religious life,
12 2502 Out of all eyes, tongues, mindes and iniuries
12 2503 
12 2504    Bene. Signior Leonato, let the Frier aduise you,
12 2505 And though you know my inwardnesse and loue
12 2506 Is very much vnto the Prince and Claudio.
12 2507 Yet, by mine honor, I will deale in this,
12 2508 As secretly and iustlie, as your soule
12 2509 Should with your bodie
12 2510 
12 2511    Leon. Being that I flow in greefe,
12 2512 The smallest twine may lead me
12 2513 
12 2514    Frier. 'Tis well consented, presently away,
12 2515 For to strange sores, strangely they straine the cure,
12 2516 Come Lady, die to liue, this wedding day
12 2517 Perhaps is but prolong'd, haue patience & endure.
12 2518 Enter.
12 2519 
12 2520   Bene. Lady Beatrice, haue you wept all this while?
12 2521   Beat. Yea, and I will weepe a while longer
12 2522 
12 2523    Bene. I will not desire that
12 2524 
12 2525    Beat. You haue no reason, I doe it freely
12 2526 
12 2527    Bene. Surelie I do beleeue your fair cosin is wrong'd
12 2528 
12 2529    Beat. Ah, how much might the man deserue of mee
12 2530 that would right her!
12 2531   Bene. Is there any way to shew such friendship?
12 2532   Beat. A verie euen way, but no such friend
12 2533 
12 2534    Bene. May a man doe it?
12 2535   Beat. It is a mans office, but not yours
12 2536 
12 2537    Bene. I doe loue nothing in the world so well as you,
12 2538 is not that strange?
12 2539   Beat. As strange as the thing I know not, it were as
12 2540 possible for me to say, I loued nothing so well as you, but
12 2541 beleeue me not, and yet I lie not, I confesse nothing, nor
12 2542 I deny nothing, I am sorry for my cousin
12 2543 
12 2544    Bene. By my sword Beatrice thou lou'st me
12 2545 
12 2546    Beat. Doe not sweare by it and eat it
12 2547 
12 2548    Bene. I will sweare by it that you loue mee, and I will
12 2549 make him eat it that sayes I loue not you
12 2550 
12 2551    Beat. Will you not eat your word?
12 2552   Bene. With no sawce that can be deuised to it, I protest
12 2553 I loue thee
12 2554 
12 2555    Beat. Why then God forgiue me
12 2556 
12 2557    Bene. What offence sweet Beatrice?
12 2558   Beat. You haue stayed me in a happy howre, I was about
12 2559 to protest I loued you
12 2560 
12 2561    Bene. And doe it with all thy heart
12 2562 
12 2563    Beat. I loue you with so much of my heart, that none
12 2564 is left to protest
12 2565 
12 2566    Bened. Come, bid me doe any thing for thee
12 2567 
12 2568    Beat. Kill Claudio
12 2569 
12 2570    Bene. Ha, not for the wide world
12 2571 
12 2572    Beat. You kill me to denie, farewell
12 2573 
12 2574    Bene. Tarrie sweet Beatrice
12 2575 
12 2576    Beat. I am gone, though I am heere, there is no loue
12 2577 in you, nay I pray you let me goe
12 2578 
12 2579    Bene. Beatrice
12 2580 
12 2581    Beat. Infaith I will goe
12 2582 
12 2583    Bene. Wee'll be friends first
12 2584 
12 2585    Beat. You dare easier be friends with mee, than fight
12 2586 with mine enemy
12 2587 
12 2588    Bene. Is Claudio thine enemie?
12 2589   Beat. Is a not approued in the height a villaine, that
12 2590 hath slandered, scorned, dishonoured my kinswoman? O
12 2591 that I were a man! what, beare her in hand vntill they
12 2592 come to take hands, and then with publike accusation
12 2593 vncouered slander, vnmittigated rancour? O God that I
12 2594 were a man! I would eat his heart in the market-place
12 2595 
12 2596    Bene. Heare me Beatrice
12 2597 
12 2598    Beat. Talke with a man out at a window, a proper
12 2599 saying
12 2600 
12 2601    Bene. Nay but Beatrice
12 2602 
12 2603    Beat. Sweet Hero, she is wrong'd, shee is slandered,
12 2604 she is vndone
12 2605 
12 2606    Bene. Beat?
12 2607   Beat. Princes and Counties! surelie a Princely testimonie,
12 2608 a goodly Count, Comfect, a sweet Gallant surelie,
12 2609 O that I were a man for his sake! or that I had any
12 2610 friend would be a man for my sake! But manhood is melted
12 2611 into cursies, valour into complement, and men are
12 2612 onelie turned into tongue, and trim ones too: he is now
12 2613 as valiant as Hercules, that only tells a lie, and sweares it:
12 2614 I cannot be a man with wishing, therfore I will die a woman
12 2615 with grieuing
12 2616 
12 2617    Bene. Tarry good Beatrice, by this hand I loue thee
12 2618 
12 2619    Beat. Vse it for my loue some other way then swearing
12 2620 by it
12 2621 
12 2622    Bened. Thinke you in your soule the Count Claudio
12 2623 hath wrong'd Hero?
12 2624   Beat. Yea, as sure as I haue a thought, or a soule
12 2625 
12 2626    Bene. Enough, I am engagde, I will challenge him, I
12 2627 will kisse your hand, and so leaue you: by this hand Claudio
12 2628 shall render me a deere account: as you heare of me,
12 2629 so thinke of me: goe comfort your coosin, I must say she
12 2630 is dead, and so farewell.

12 2654 doe you serue God: maisters, it is proued alreadie
12 2655 that you are little better than false knaues, and it will goe
12 2656 neere to be thought so shortly, how answer you for your
12 2657 selues?
12 2658   Con. Marry sir, we say we are none
12 2659

12 2661 will goe about with him: come you hither sirra, a word
12 2662 in your eare sir, I say to you, it is thought you are false
12 2663 knaues
12 2664 
12 2665    Bor. Sir, I say to you, we are none

12 2669   Sext. Master Constable, you goe not the way to examine,
12 2670 you must call forth the watch that are their accusers
12 2671 
12 2672    Kemp. Yea marry, that's the eftest way, let the watch
12 2673 come forth: masters, I charge you in the Princes name,
12 2674 accuse these men
12 2675 
12 2676    Watch 1. This man said sir, that Don Iohn the Princes
12 2677 brother was a villaine
12 2678 
12 2679    Kemp. Write down, Prince Iohn a villaine: why this

12 2681 
12 2682    Bora. Master Constable
12 2683 
12 2684    Kemp. Pray thee fellow peace, I do not like thy looke
12 2685 I promise thee

12 2688   Watch 2. Mary that he had receiued a thousand Dukates
12 2689 of Don Iohn, for accusing the Lady Hero wrongfully
12 2690 
12 2691    Kemp. Flat Burglarie as euer was committed
12 2692 
12 2693    Const. Yea by th' masse that it is
12 2694 
12 2695    Sexton. What else fellow?
12 2696   Watch 1. And that Count Claudio did meane vpon his
12 2697 words, to disgrace Hero before the whole assembly, and
12 2698 not marry her
12 2699 
12 2700    Kemp. O villaine! thou wilt be condemn'd into euerlasting
12 2701 redemption for this
12 2702 
12 2703    Sexton. What else?
12 2704   Watch. This is all
12 2705 
12 2706    Sexton. And this is more masters then you can deny,
12 2707 Prince Iohn is this morning secretly stolne away: Hero
12 2708 was in this manner accus'd, in this very manner refus'd,
12 2709 and vpon the griefe of this sodainely died: Master Constable,
12 2710 let these men be bound, and brought to Leonato,
12 2711 I will goe before, and shew him their examination
12 2712 
12 2713    Const. Come, let them be opinion'd
12 2714 
12 2715    Sex. Let them be in the hands of Coxcombe
12 2716 
12 2717    Kem. Gods my life, where's the Sexton? let him write
12 2718 downe the Princes Officer Coxcombe: come, binde them
12 2719 thou naughty varlet
12 2720 
12 2721    Couley. Away, you are an asse, you are an asse
12 2722 
12 2723    Kemp. Dost thou not suspect my place? dost thou not
12 2724 suspect my yeeres? O that hee were heere to write mee
12 2725 downe an asse! but masters, remember that I am an asse:
12 2726 though it be not written down, yet forget not y I am an
12 2727 asse: No thou villaine, y art full of piety as shall be prou'd
12 2728 vpon thee by good witnesse, I am a wise fellow, and
12 2729 which is more, an officer, and which is more, a houshoulder,
12 2730 and which is more, as pretty a peece of flesh as any in
12 2731 Messina, and one that knowes the Law, goe to, & a rich
12 2732 fellow enough, goe to, and a fellow that hath had losses,
12 2733 and one that hath two gownes, and euery thing handsome
12 2734 about him: bring him away: O that I had been writ
12 2735 downe an asse!
12 2736 Enter.
12 2737 
12 2738 
12 2739 Actus Quintus.
12 2740 
12 2741 Enter Leonato and his brother.
12 2742 
12 2743   Brother. If you goe on thus, you will kill your selfe,
12 2744 And 'tis not wisedome thus to second griefe,
12 2745 Against your selfe
12 2746 
12 2747    Leon. I pray thee cease thy counsaile,
12 2748 Which falls into mine eares as profitlesse,
12 2749 As water in a siue: giue not me counsaile,
12 2750 Nor let no comfort delight mine eare,
12 2751 But such a one whose wrongs doth sute with mine.
12 2752 Bring me a father that so lou'd his childe,
12 2753 Whose ioy of her is ouer-whelmed like mine,
12 2754 And bid him speake of patience,
12 2755 Measure his woe the length and bredth of mine,
12 2756 And let it answere euery straine for straine,
12 2757 As thus for thus, and such a griefe for such,
12 2758 In euery lineament, branch, shape, and forme:
12 2759 If such a one will smile and stroke his beard,
12 2760 And sorrow, wagge, crie hem, when he should grone,
12 2761 Patch griefe with prouerbs, make misfortune drunke,
12 2762 With candle-wasters: bring him yet to me,
12 2763 And I of him will gather patience:
12 2764 But there is no such man, for brother, men
12 2765 Can counsaile, and speake comfort to that griefe,
12 2766 Which they themselues not feele, but tasting it,
12 2767 Their counsaile turnes to passion, which before,
12 2768 Would giue preceptiall medicine to rage,
12 2769 Fetter strong madnesse in a silken thred,
12 2770 Charme ache with ayre, and agony with words,
12 2771 No, no, 'tis all mens office, to speake patience
12 2772 To those that wring vnder the load of sorrow:
12 2773 But no mans vertue nor sufficiencie
12 2774 To be so morall, when he shall endure
12 2775 The like himselfe: therefore giue me no counsaile,
12 2776 My griefs cry lowder then aduertisement
12 2777 
12 2778    Broth. Therein do men from children nothing differ
12 2779 
12 2780    Leonato. I pray thee peace, I will be flesh and bloud,
12 2781 For there was neuer yet Philosopher,
12 2782 That could endure the tooth-ake patiently,
12 2783 How euer they haue writ the stile of gods,
12 2784 And made a push at chance and sufferance
12 2785 
12 2786    Brother. Yet bend not all the harme vpon your selfe,
12 2787 Make those that doe offend you, suffer too
12 2788 
12 2789    Leon. There thou speak'st reason, nay I will doe so,
12 2790 My soule doth tell me, Hero is belied,
12 2791 And that shall Claudio know, so shall the Prince,
12 2792 And all of them that thus dishonour her.
12 2793 Enter Prince and Claudio.
12 2794 
12 2795   Brot. Here comes the Prince and Claudio hastily
12 2796 
12 2797    Prin. Good den, good den
12 2798 
12 2799    Clau. Good day to both of you
12 2800 
12 2801    Leon. Heare you my Lords?
12 2802   Prin. We haue some haste Leonato
12 2803 
12 2804    Leo. Some haste my Lord! wel, fareyouwel my Lord,
12 2805 Are you so hasty now? well, all is one
12 2806 
12 2807    Prin. Nay, do not quarrel with vs, good old man
12 2808 
12 2809    Brot. If he could rite himselfe with quarrelling,
12 2810 Some of vs would lie low
12 2811 
12 2812    Claud. Who wrongs him?
12 2813   Leon. Marry y dost wrong me, thou dissembler, thou:
12 2814 Nay, neuer lay thy hand vpon thy sword,
12 2815 I feare thee not
12 2816 
12 2817    Claud. Marry beshrew my hand,
12 2818 If it should giue your age such cause of feare,
12 2819 Infaith my hand meant nothing to my sword
12 2820 
12 2821    Leonato. Tush, tush, man, neuer fleere and iest at me,
12 2822 I speake not like a dotard, nor a foole,
12 2823 As vnder priuiledge of age to bragge,
12 2824 What I haue done being yong, or what would doe,
12 2825 Were I not old, know Claudio to thy head,
12 2826 Thou hast so wrong'd my innocent childe and me,
12 2827 That I am forc'd to lay my reuerence by,
12 2828 And with grey haires and bruise of many daies,
12 2829 Doe challenge thee to triall of a man,
12 2830 I say thou hast belied mine innocent childe.
12 2831 Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart,
12 2832 And she lies buried with her ancestors:
12 2833 O in a tombe where neuer scandall slept,
12 2834 Saue this of hers, fram'd by thy villanie
12 2835 
12 2836    Claud. My villany?
12 2837   Leonato. Thine Claudio, thine I say
12 2838 
12 2839    Prin. You say not right old man
12 2840 
12 2841    Leon. My Lord, my Lord,
12 2842 Ile proue it on his body if he dare,
12 2843 Despight his nice fence, and his actiue practise,
12 2844 His Maie of youth, and bloome of lustihood
12 2845 
12 2846    Claud. Away, I will not haue to do with you
12 2847 
12 2848    Leo. Canst thou so daffe me? thou hast kild my child,
12 2849 If thou kilst me, boy, thou shalt kill a man
12 2850 
12 2851    Bro. He shall kill two of vs, and men indeed,
12 2852 But that's no matter, let him kill one first:
12 2853 Win me and weare me, let him answere me,
12 2854 Come follow me boy, come sir boy, come follow me
12 2855 Sir boy, ile whip you from your foyning fence,
12 2856 Nay, as I am a gentleman, I will
12 2857 
12 2858    Leon. Brother
12 2859 
12 2860    Brot. Content your self, God knows I lou'd my neece,
12 2861 And she is dead, slander'd to death by villaines,
12 2862 That dare as well answer a man indeede,
12 2863 As I dare take a serpent by the tongue.
12 2864 Boyes, apes, braggarts, Iackes, milke-sops
12 2865 
12 2866    Leon. Brother Anthony
12 2867 
12 2868    Brot. Hold you content, what man? I know them, yea
12 2869 And what they weigh, euen to the vtmost scruple,
12 2870 Scambling, out-facing, fashion-monging boyes,
12 2871 That lye, and cog, and flout, depraue, and slander,
12 2872 Goe antiquely, and show outward hidiousnesse,
12 2873 And speake of halfe a dozen dang'rous words,
12 2874 How they might hurt their enemies, if they durst.
12 2875 And this is all
12 2876 
12 2877    Leon. But brother Anthonie
12 2878 
12 2879    Ant. Come, 'tis no matter,
12 2880 Do not you meddle, let me deale in this
12 2881 
12 2882    Pri. Gentlemen both, we will not wake your patience
12 2883 My heart is sorry for your daughters death:
12 2884 But on my honour she was charg'd with nothing
12 2885 But what was true, and very full of proofe
12 2886 
12 2887    Leon. My Lord, my Lord
12 2888 
12 2889    Prin. I will not heare you.
12 2890 Enter Benedicke.
12 2891 
12 2892   Leo. No come brother, away, I will be heard.
12 2893 
12 2894 Exeunt. ambo.
12 2895 
12 2896   Bro. And shall, or some of vs will smart for it
12 2897 
12 2898    Prin. See, see, here comes the man we went to seeke
12 2899 
12 2900    Clau. Now signior, what newes?
12 2901   Ben. Good day my Lord
12 2902 
12 2903    Prin. Welcome signior, you are almost come to part
12 2904 almost a fray
12 2905 
12 2906    Clau. Wee had likt to haue had our two noses snapt
12 2907 off with two old men without teeth
12 2908 
12 2909    Prin. Leonato and his brother, what think'st thou? had
12 2910 wee fought, I doubt we should haue beene too yong for
12 2911 them
12 2912 
12 2913    Ben. In a false quarrell there is no true valour, I came
12 2914 to seeke you both
12 2915 
12 2916    Clau. We haue beene vp and downe to seeke thee, for
12 2917 we are high proofe melancholly, and would faine haue it
12 2918 beaten away, wilt thou vse thy wit?
12 2919   Ben. It is in my scabberd, shall I draw it?
12 2920   Prin. Doest thou weare thy wit by thy side?
12 2921   Clau. Neuer any did so, though verie many haue been
12 2922 beside their wit, I will bid thee drawe, as we do the minstrels,
12 2923 draw to pleasure vs
12 2924 
12 2925    Prin. As I am an honest man he lookes pale, art thou
12 2926 sicke, or angrie?
12 2927   Clau. What, courage man: what though care kil'd a
12 2928 cat, thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care
12 2929 
12 2930    Ben. Sir, I shall meete your wit in the careere, and
12 2931 you charge it against me, I pray you chuse another subiect
12 2932 
12 2933    Clau. Nay then giue him another staffe, this last was
12 2934 broke crosse
12 2935 
12 2936    Prin. By this light, he changes more and more, I thinke
12 2937 he be angrie indeede
12 2938 
12 2939    Clau. If he be, he knowes how to turne his girdle
12 2940 
12 2941    Ben. Shall I speake a word in your eare?
12 2942   Clau. God blesse me from a challenge
12 2943 
12 2944    Ben. You are a villaine, I iest not, I will make it good
12 2945 how you dare, with what you dare, and when you dare:
12 2946 do me right, or I will protest your cowardise: you haue
12 2947 kill'd a sweete Ladie, and her death shall fall heauie on
12 2948 you, let me heare from you
12 2949 
12 2950    Clau. Well, I will meete you, so I may haue good
12 2951 cheare
12 2952 
12 2953    Prin. What, a feast, a feast?
12 2954   Clau. I faith I thanke him, he hath bid me to a calues
12 2955 head and a Capon, the which if I doe not carue most curiously,
12 2956 say my knife's naught, shall I not finde a woodcocke
12 2957 too?
12 2958   Ben. Sir, your wit ambles well, it goes easily
12 2959 
12 2960    Prin. Ile tell thee how Beatrice prais'd thy wit the other
12 2961 day: I said thou hadst a fine wit: true saies she, a fine
12 2962 little one: no said I, a great wit: right saies shee, a great
12 2963 grosse one: nay said I, a good wit: iust said she, it hurts
12 2964 no body: nay said I, the gentleman is wise: certaine said
12 2965 she, a wise gentleman: nay said I, he hath the tongues:
12 2966 that I beleeue said shee, for hee swore a thing to me on
12 2967 munday night, which he forswore on tuesday morning:
12 2968 there's a double tongue, there's two tongues: thus did
12 2969 shee an howre together trans-shape thy particular vertues,
12 2970 yet at last she concluded with a sigh, thou wast the
12 2971 proprest man in Italie
12 2972 
12 2973    Claud. For the which she wept heartily, and said shee
12 2974 car'd not
12 2975 
12 2976    Prin. Yea that she did, but yet for all that, and if shee
12 2977 did not hate him deadlie, shee would loue him dearely,
12 2978 the old mans daughter told vs all
12 2979 
12 2980    Clau. All, all, and moreouer, God saw him when he
12 2981 was hid in the garden
12 2982 
12 2983    Prin. But when shall we set the sauage Bulls hornes
12 2984 on the sensible Benedicks head?
12 2985   Clau. Yea and text vnderneath, heere dwells Benedicke
12 2986 the married man
12 2987 
12 2988    Ben. Fare you well, Boy, you know my minde, I will
12 2989 leaue you now to your gossep-like humor, you breake
12 2990 iests as braggards do their blades, which God be thanked
12 2991 hurt not: my Lord, for your manie courtesies I thank
12 2992 you, I must discontinue your companie, your brother
12 2993 the Bastard is fled from Messina: you haue among you,
12 2994 kill'd a sweet and innocent Ladie: for my Lord Lackebeard
12 2995 there, he and I shall meete, and till then peace be
12 2996 with him
12 2997 
12 2998    Prin. He is in earnest
12 2999 
12 3000    Clau. In most profound earnest, and Ile warrant you,
12 3001 for the loue of Beatrice
12 3002 
12 3003    Prin. And hath challeng'd thee
12 3004 
12 3005    Clau. Most sincerely
12 3006 
12 3007    Prin. What a prettie thing man is, when he goes in his
12 3008 doublet and hose, and leaues off his wit.
12 3009 Enter Constable, Conrade, and Borachio.
12 3010 
12 3011   Clau. He is then a Giant to an Ape, but then is an Ape
12 3012 a Doctor to such a man
12 3013 
12 3014    Prin. But soft you, let me be, plucke vp my heart, and
12 3015 be sad, did he not say my brother was fled?
12 3016   Const. Come you sir, if iustice cannot tame you, shee
12 3017 shall nere weigh more reasons in her ballance, nay, and
12 3018 you be a cursing hypocrite once, you must be lookt to
12 3019 
12 3020    Prin. How now, two of my brothers men bound? Borachio
12 3021 one
12 3022 
12 3023    Clau. Harken after their offence my Lord
12 3024 
12 3025    Prin. Officers, what offence haue these men done?
12 3026   Const. Marrie sir, they haue committed false report,
12 3027 moreouer they haue spoken vntruths, secondarily they
12 3028 are slanders, sixt and lastly, they haue belyed a Ladie,
12 3029 thirdly, they haue verified vniust things, and to conclude
12 3030 they are lying knaues
12 3031 
12 3032    Prin. First I aske thee what they haue done, thirdlie
12 3033 I aske thee what's their offence, sixt and lastlie why they
12 3034 are committed, and to conclude, what you lay to their
12 3035 charge
12 3036 
12 3037    Clau. Rightlie reasoned, and in his owne diuision, and
12 3038 by my troth there's one meaning well suted
12 3039 
12 3040    Prin. Who haue you offended masters, that you are
12 3041 thus bound to your answer? this learned Constable is too
12 3042 cunning to be vnderstood, what's your offence?
12 3043   Bor. Sweete Prince, let me go no farther to mine answere:
12 3044 do you heare me, and let this Count kill mee: I
12 3045 haue deceiued euen your verie eies: what your wisedomes
12 3046 could not discouer, these shallow fooles haue
12 3047 brought to light, who in the night ouerheard me confessing
12 3048 to this man, how Don Iohn your brother incensed
12 3049 me to slander the Ladie Hero, how you were brought
12 3050 into the Orchard, and saw me court Margaret in Heroes
12 3051 garments, how you disgrac'd her when you should
12 3052 marrie her: my villanie they haue vpon record, which
12 3053 I had rather seale with my death, then repeate ouer to
12 3054 my shame: the Ladie is dead vpon mine and my masters
12 3055 false accusation: and briefelie, I desire nothing but the
12 3056 reward of a villaine
12 3057 
12 3058    Prin. Runs not this speech like yron through your
12 3059 bloud?
12 3060   Clau. I haue drunke poison whiles he vtter'd it
12 3061 
12 3062    Prin. But did my Brother set thee on to this?
12 3063   Bor. Yea, and paid me richly for the practise of it
12 3064 
12 3065    Prin. He is compos'd and fram'd of treacherie,
12 3066 And fled he is vpon this villanie
12 3067 
12 3068    Clau. Sweet Hero, now thy image doth appeare
12 3069 In the rare semblance that I lou'd it first
12 3070 
12 3071    Const. Come, bring away the plaintiffes, by this time
12 3072 our Sexton hath reformed Signior Leonato of the matter:
12 3073 and masters, do not forget to specifie when time & place
12 3074 shall serue, that I am an Asse
12 3075 
12 3076    Con.2. Here, here comes master Signior Leonato, and
12 3077 the Sexton too.
12 3078 Enter Leonato.
12 3079 
12 3080   Leon. Which is the villaine? let me see his eies,
12 3081 That when I note another man like him,
12 3082 I may auoide him: which of these is he?
12 3083   Bor. If you would know your wronger, looke on me
12 3084 
12 3085    Leon. Art thou the slaue that with thy breath
12 3086 hast kild mine innocent childe?
12 3087   Bor. Yea, euen I alone
12 3088 
12 3089    Leo. No, not so villaine, thou beliest thy selfe,
12 3090 Here stand a paire of honourable men,
12 3091 A third is fled that had a hand in it:
12 3092 I thanke you Princes for my daughters death,
12 3093 Record it with your high and worthie deedes,
12 3094 'Twas brauely done, if you bethinke you of it
12 3095 
12 3096    Clau. I know not how to pray your patience,
12 3097 Yet I must speake, choose your reuenge your selfe,
12 3098 Impose me to what penance your inuention
12 3099 Can lay vpon my sinne, yet sinn'd I not,
12 3100 But in mistaking
12 3101 
12 3102    Prin. By my soule nor I,
12 3103 And yet to satisfie this good old man,
12 3104 I would bend vnder anie heauie waight,
12 3105 That heele enioyne me to
12 3106 
12 3107    Leon. I cannot bid you bid my daughter liue,
12 3108 That were impossible, but I praie you both,
12 3109 Possesse the people in Messina here,
12 3110 How innocent she died, and if your loue
12 3111 Can labour aught in sad inuention,
12 3112 Hang her an epitaph vpon her toomb,
12 3113 And sing it to her bones, sing it to night:
12 3114 To morrow morning come you to my house,
12 3115 And since you could not be my sonne in law,
12 3116 Be yet my Nephew: my brother hath a daughter,
12 3117 Almost the copie of my childe that's dead,
12 3118 And she alone is heire to both of vs,
12 3119 Giue her the right you should haue giu'n her cosin,
12 3120 And so dies my reuenge
12 3121 
12 3122    Clau. O noble sir!
12 3123 Your ouerkindnesse doth wring teares from me,
12 3124 I do embrace your offer, and dispose
12 3125 For henceforth of poore Claudio
12 3126 
12 3127    Leon. To morrow then I will expect your comming,
12 3128 To night I take my leaue, this naughtie man
12 3129 Shall face to face be brought to Margaret,
12 3130 Who I beleeue was packt in all this wrong,
12 3131 Hired to it by your brother
12 3132 
12 3133    Bor. No, by my soule she was not,
12 3134 Nor knew not what she did when she spoke to me,
12 3135 But alwaies hath bin iust and vertuous,
12 3136 In anie thing that I do know by her
12 3137 
12 3138    Const. Moreouer sir, which indeede is not vnder white
12 3139 and black, this plaintiffe here, the offendour did call mee
12 3140 asse, I beseech you let it be remembred in his punishment,
12 3141 and also the watch heard them talke of one Deformed,
12 3142 they say he weares a key in his eare and a lock hanging
12 3143 by it, and borrowes monie in Gods name, the which
12 3144 he hath vs'd so long, and neuer paied, that now men grow
12 3145 hard-harted and will lend nothing for Gods sake: praie
12 3146 you examine him vpon that point
12 3147 
12 3148    Leon. I thanke thee for thy care and honest paines
12 3149 
12 3150    Const. Your worship speakes like a most thankefull
12 3151 and reuerend youth, and I praise God for you
12 3152 
12 3153    Leon. There's for thy paines
12 3154 
12 3155    Const. God saue the foundation
12 3156 
12 3157    Leon. Goe, I discharge thee of thy prisoner, and I
12 3158 thanke thee
12 3159 
12 3160    Const. I leaue an arrant knaue with your worship,
12 3161 which I beseech your worship to correct your selfe, for
12 3162 the example of others: God keepe your worship, I
12 3163 wish your worship well, God restore you to health,
12 3164 I humblie giue you leaue to depart, and if a merrie
12 3165 meeting may be wisht, God prohibite it: come
12 3166 neighbour
12 3167 
12 3168    Leon. Vntill to morrow morning, Lords, farewell.
12 3169 
12 3170 Exeunt.
12 3171 
12 3172   Brot. Farewell my Lords, we looke for you to morrow
12 3173 
12 3174    Prin. We will not faile
12 3175 
12 3176    Clau. To night ile mourne with Hero
12 3177 
12 3178    Leon. Bring you these fellowes on, weel talke with
12 3179 Margaret, How her acquaintance grew with this lewd
12 3180 fellow.
12 3181 
12 3182 Exeunt.
12 3183 
12 3184 Enter Benedicke and Margaret.
12 3185 
12 3186   Ben. Praie thee sweete Mistris Margaret, deserue
12 3187 well at my hands, by helping mee to the speech of Beatrice
12 3188 
12 3189    Mar. Will you then write me a Sonnet in praise of
12 3190 my beautie?
12 3191   Bene. In so high a stile Margaret, that no man liuing
12 3192 shall come ouer it, for in most comely truth thou deseruest
12 3193 it
12 3194 
12 3195    Mar. To haue no man come ouer me, why, shall I alwaies
12 3196 keepe below staires?
12 3197   Bene. Thy wit is as quicke as the grey-hounds mouth,
12 3198 it catches
12 3199 
12 3200    Mar. And yours, as blunt as the Fencers foiles, which
12 3201 hit, but hurt not
12 3202 
12 3203    Bene. A most manly wit Margaret, it will not hurt a
12 3204 woman: and so I pray thee call Beatrice, I giue thee the
12 3205 bucklers
12 3206 
12 3207    Mar. Giue vs the swords, wee haue bucklers of our
12 3208 owne
12 3209 
12 3210    Bene. If you vse them Margaret, you must put in the
12 3211 pikes with a vice, and they are dangerous weapons for
12 3212 Maides
12 3213 
12 3214    Mar. Well, I will call Beatrice to you, who I thinke
12 3215 hath legges.
12 3216 
12 3217 Exit Margarite.
12 3218 
12 3219   Ben. And therefore will come. The God of loue that
12 3220 sits aboue, and knowes me, and knowes me, how pittifull
12 3221 I deserue. I meane in singing, but in louing, Leander
12 3222 the good swimmer, Troilous the first imploier of
12 3223 pandars, and a whole booke full of these quondam carpet-mongers,
12 3224 whose name yet runne smoothly in the euen
12 3225 rode of a blanke verse, why they were neuer so truely
12 3226 turned ouer and ouer as my poore selfe in loue: marrie
12 3227 I cannot shew it rime, I haue tried, I can finde out no
12 3228 rime to Ladie but babie, an innocent rime: for scorne,
12 3229 horne, a hard rime: for schoole foole, a babling rime:
12 3230 verie ominous endings, no, I was not borne vnder a riming
12 3231 Plannet, for I cannot wooe in festiuall tearmes:
12 3232 Enter Beatrice.
12 3233 
12 3234 sweete Beatrice would'st thou come when I cal'd
12 3235 thee?
12 3236   Beat. Yea Signior, and depart when you bid me
12 3237 
12 3238    Bene. O stay but till then
12 3239 
12 3240    Beat. Then, is spoken: fare you well now, and yet ere
12 3241 I goe, let me goe with that I came, which is, with knowing
12 3242 what hath past betweene you and Claudio
12 3243 
12 3244    Bene. Onely foule words, and thereupon I will kisse
12 3245 thee
12 3246 
12 3247    Beat. Foule words is but foule wind, and foule wind
12 3248 is but foule breath, and foule breath is noisome, therefore
12 3249 I will depart vnkist
12 3250 
12 3251    Bene. Thou hast frighted the word out of his right
12 3252 sence, so forcible is thy wit, but I must tell thee plainely,
12 3253 Claudio vndergoes my challenge, and either I must shortly
12 3254 heare from him, or I will subscribe him a coward, and
12 3255 I pray thee now tell me, for which of my bad parts didst
12 3256 thou first fall in loue with me?
12 3257   Beat. For them all together, which maintain'd so
12 3258 politique a state of euill, that they will not admit any
12 3259 good part to intermingle with them: but for which of
12 3260 my good parts did you first suffer loue for me?
12 3261   Bene. Suffer loue! a good epithite, I do suffer loue indeede,
12 3262 for I loue thee against my will,
12 3263   Beat. In spight of your heart I think, alas poore heart,
12 3264 if you spight it for my sake, I will spight it for yours, for
12 3265 I will neuer loue that which my friend hates
12 3266 
12 3267    Bened. Thou and I are too wise to wooe peaceablie
12 3268 
12 3269    Bea. It appeares not in this confession, there's not one
12 3270 wise man among twentie that will praise himselfe
12 3271 
12 3272    Bene. An old, an old instance Beatrice, that liu'd in
12 3273 the time of good neighbours, if a man doe not erect in
12 3274 this age his owne tombe ere he dies, hee shall liue no
12 3275 longer in monuments, then the Bels ring, & the Widdow
12 3276 weepes
12 3277 
12 3278    Beat. And how long is that thinke you?
12 3279   Ben. Question, why an hower in clamour and a quarter
12 3280 in rhewme, therfore is it most expedient for the wise,
12 3281 if Don worme (his conscience) finde no impediment to
12 3282 the contrarie, to be the trumpet of his owne vertues, as
12 3283 I am to my selfe so much for praising my selfe, who I my
12 3284 selfe will beare witnesse is praise worthie, and now tell
12 3285 me, how doth your cosin?
12 3286   Beat. Verie ill
12 3287 
12 3288    Bene. And how doe you?
12 3289   Beat. Verie ill too.
12 3290 Enter Vrsula.
12 3291 
12 3292   Bene. Serue God, loue me, and mend, there will I leaue
12 3293 you too, for here comes one in haste
12 3294 
12 3295    Vrs. Madam, you must come to your Vncle, yonders
12 3296 old coile at home, it is prooued my Ladie Hero
12 3297 hath bin falselie accusde, the Prince and Claudio
12 3298 mightilie abusde, and Don Iohn is the author of all, who
12 3299 is fled and gone: will you come presentlie?
12 3300   Beat. Will you go heare this newes Signior?
12 3301   Bene. I will liue in thy heart, die in thy lap, and be buried
12 3302 in thy eies: and moreouer, I will goe with thee to
12 3303 thy Vncles.
12 3304 
12 3305 Exeunt.
12 3306 
12 3307 Enter Claudio, Prince, and three or foure with Tapers.
12 3308 
12 3309   Clau. Is this the monument of Leonato?
12 3310   Lord. It is my Lord.
12 3311 
12 3312 Epitaph.
12 3313 
12 3314 Done to death by slanderous tongues,
12 3315 Was the Hero that here lies:
12 3316 Death in guerdon of her wrongs,
12 3317 Giues her fame which neuer dies:
12 3318 So the life that dyed with shame,
12 3319 Liues in death with glorious fame.
12 3320 Hang thou there vpon the tombe,
12 3321 Praising her when I am dombe
12 3322 
12 3323    Clau. Now musick sound & sing your solemn hymne
12 3324 
12 3325 Song.
12 3326 
12 3327 Pardon goddesse of the night,
12 3328 Those that slew thy virgin knight,
12 3329 For the which with songs of woe,
12 3330 Round about her tombe they goe:
12 3331 Midnight assist our mone, helpe vs to sigh and grone.
12 3332 Heauily, heauily.
12 3333 Graues yawne and yeelde your dead,
12 3334 Till death be vttered,
12 3335 Heauenly, heauenly
12 3336 
12 3337    Lo. Now vnto thy bones good night, yeerely will I do this right
12 3338 
12 3339    Prin. Good morrow masters, put your Torches out,
12 3340 The wolues haue preied, and looke, the gentle day
12 3341 Before the wheeles of Phoebus, round about
12 3342 Dapples the drowsie East with spots of grey:
12 3343 Thanks to you all, and leaue vs, fare you well
12 3344 
12 3345    Clau. Good morrow masters, each his seuerall way
12 3346 
12 3347    Prin. Come let vs hence, and put on other weedes,
12 3348 And then to Leonatoes we will goe
12 3349 
12 3350    Clau. And Hymen now with luckier issue speeds,
12 3351 Then this for whom we rendred vp this woe.
12 3352 
12 3353 Exeunt.
12 3354 
12 3355 Enter Leonato, Bene. Marg. Vrsula, old man, Frier, Hero.
12 3356 
12 3357   Frier. Did I not tell you she was innocent?
12 3358   Leo. So are the Prince and Claudio who accus'd her,
12 3359 Vpon the errour that you heard debated:
12 3360 But Margaret was in some fault for this,
12 3361 Although against her will as it appeares,
12 3362 In the true course of all the question
12 3363 
12 3364    Old. Well, I am glad that all things sort so well
12 3365 
12 3366    Bene. And so am I, being else by faith enforc'd
12 3367 To call young Claudio to a reckoning for it
12 3368 
12 3369    Leo. Well daughter, and you gentlewomen all,

12 3371 And when I send for you, come hither mask'd:
12 3372 The Prince and Claudio promis'd by this howre
12 3373 To visit me, you know your office Brother,
12 3374 You must be father to your brothers daughter,
12 3375 And giue her to young Claudio.
12 3376 
12 3377 Exeunt. Ladies.
12 3378 
12 3379   Old. Which I will doe with confirm'd countenance
12 3380 
12 3381    Bene. Frier, I must intreat your paines, I thinke
12 3382

12 3416 So full of frost, of storme, and clowdinesse
12 3417 
12 3418    Claud. I thinke he thinkes vpon the sauage bull:
12 3419 Tush, feare not man, wee'll tip thy hornes with gold,
12 3420 And all Europa shall reioyce at thee,
12 3421 As once Europa did at lusty Ioue,
12 3422 When he would play the noble beast in loue
12 3423 
12 3424    Ben. Bull Ioue sir, had an amiable low,

12 3444 
12 3445    Clau. Another Hero?
12 3446   Hero. Nothing certainer.
12 3447 One Hero died, but I doe liue,

12 3463   Beat. Why no, no more then reason
12 3464 
12 3465    Bene. Why then your Vncle, and the Prince, & Claudio,
12 3466 haue beene deceiued, they swore you did
12 3467 
12 3468    Beat. Doe not you loue mee?

12 3481    Leon. Come Cosin, I am sure you loue the gentlema[n]
12 3482 
12 3483    Clau. And Ile be sworne vpon't, that he loues her,
12 3484 For heres a paper written in his hand,
12 3485 A halting sonnet of his owne pure braine,
12 3486 Fashioned to Beatrice
12 3487 
12 3488    Hero. And heeres another,
12 3489 Writ in my cosins hand, stolne from her pocket,
12 3490 Containing her affection vnto Benedicke
12 3491 
12 3492    Bene. A miracle, here's our owne hands against our
12 3493 hearts: come I will haue thee, but by this light I take
12 3494 thee for pittie
12 3495 
12 3496    Beat. I would not denie you, but by this good day, I
12 3497 yeeld vpon great perswasion, & partly to saue your life,
12 3498 for I was told, you were in a consumption
12 3499 
12 3500    Leon. Peace I will stop your mouth
12 3501 
12 3502    Prin. How dost thou Benedicke the married man?
12 3503   Bene. Ile tell thee what Prince: a Colledge of witte-crackers
12 3504 cannot flout mee out of my humour, dost thou
12 3505 think I care for a Satyre or an Epigram? no, if a man will
12 3506 be beaten with braines, a shall weare nothing handsome
12 3507 about him: in briefe, since I do purpose to marry, I will
12 3508 thinke nothing to any purpose that the world can say against
12 3509 it, and therefore neuer flout at me, for I haue said
12 3510 against it: for man is a giddy thing, and this is my conclusion:
12 3511 for thy part Claudio, I did thinke to haue beaten
12 3512 thee, but in that thou art like to be my kinsman, liue vnbruis'd,
12 3513 and loue my cousin
12 3514 
12 3515    Cla. I had well hop'd y wouldst haue denied Beatrice, y
12 3516 I might haue cudgel'd thee out of thy single life, to make
12 3517 thee a double dealer, which out of questio[n] thou wilt be,
12 3518 if my Cousin do not looke exceeding narrowly to thee
12 3519 
12 3520    Bene. Come, come, we are friends, let's haue a dance
12 3521 ere we are married, that we may lighten our own hearts,
12 3522 and our wiues heeles
12 3523 
12 3524    Leon. Wee'll haue dancing afterward
12 3525 
12 3526    Bene. First, of my word, therfore play musick. Prince,
12 3527 thou art sad, get thee a wife, get thee a wife, there is no
12 3528 staff more reuerend then one tipt with horn.
12 3529 Enter. Mes.

12 3532 And brought with armed men backe to Messina
12 3533 
12 3534    Bene. Thinke not on him till to morrow, ile deuise
12 3535 thee braue punishments for him: strike vp Pipers.
