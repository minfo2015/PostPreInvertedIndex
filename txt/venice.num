6 2 Actus primus.
6 3 
6 4 Enter Anthonio, Salarino, and Salanio.
6 5 
6 6   Anthonio. In sooth I know not why I am so sad,
6 7 It wearies me: you say it wearies you;
6 8 But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,
6 9 What stuffe 'tis made of, whereof it is borne,
6 10 I am to learne: and such a Want-wit sadnesse makes of
6 11 mee,
6 12 That I haue much ado to know my selfe
6 13 
6 14    Sal. Your minde is tossing on the Ocean,
6 15 There where your Argosies with portly saile
6 16 Like Signiors and rich Burgers on the flood,
6 17 Or as it were the Pageants of the sea,
6 18 Do ouer-peere the pettie Traffiquers
6 19 That curtsie to them, do them reuerence
6 20 As they flye by them with their wouen wings
6 21 
6 22    Salar. Beleeue me sir, had I such venture forth,
6 23 The better part of my affections, would
6 24 Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still
6 25 Plucking the grasse to know where sits the winde,
6 26 Peering in Maps for ports, and peers, and rodes:
6 27 And euery obiect that might make me feare
6 28 Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt
6 29 Would make me sad
6 30 
6 31    Sal. My winde cooling my broth,
6 32 Would blow me to an Ague, when I thought
6 33 What harme a winde too great might doe at sea.
6 34 I should not see the sandie houre-glasse runne,
6 35 But I should thinke of shallows, and of flats,
6 36 And see my wealthy Andrew docks in sand,
6 37 Vailing her high top lower then her ribs
6 38 To kisse her buriall; should I goe to Church
6 39 And see the holy edifice of stone,
6 40 And not bethinke me straight of dangerous rocks,
6 41 Which touching but my gentle Vessels side
6 42 Would scatter all her spices on the streame,
6 43 Enrobe the roring waters with my silkes,
6 44 And in a word, but euen now worth this,
6 45 And now worth nothing. Shall I haue the thought
6 46 To thinke on this, and shall I lacke the thought
6 47 That such a thing bechaunc'd would make me sad?
6 48 But tell me, I know Anthonio
6 49 Is sad to thinke vpon his merchandize
6 50 
6 51    Anth. Beleeue me no, I thanke my fortune for it,
6 52 My ventures are not in one bottome trusted,
6 53 Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate
6 54 Vpon the fortune of this present yeere:
6 55 Therefore my merchandize makes me not sad
6 56 
6 57    Sola. Why then you are in loue
6 58 
6 59    Anth. Fie, fie
6 60 
6 61    Sola. Not in loue neither: then let vs say you are sad
6 62 Because you are not merry: and 'twere as easie
6 63 For you to laugh and leape, and say you are merry
6 64 Because you are not sad. Now by two-headed Ianus,
6 65 Nature hath fram'd strange fellowes in her time:
6 66 Some that will euermore peepe through their eyes,
6 67 And laugh like Parrats at a bag-piper.
6 68 And other of such vineger aspect,
6 69 That they'll not shew their teeth in way of smile,
6 70 Though Nestor sweare the iest be laughable.
6 71 Enter Bassanio, Lorenso, and Gratiano.
6 72 
6 73   Sola. Heere comes Bassanio,
6 74 Your most noble Kinsman,
6 75 Gratiano, and Lorenso. Faryewell,
6 76 We leaue you now with better company
6 77 
6 78    Sala. I would haue staid till I had made you merry,
6 79 If worthier friends had not preuented me
6 80 
6 81    Ant. Your worth is very deere in my regard.
6 82 I take it your owne busines calls on you,
6 83 And you embrace th' occasion to depart
6 84 
6 85    Sal. Good morrow my good Lords
6 86 
6 87    Bass. Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? say, when?
6 88 You grow exceeding strange: must it be so?
6 89   Sal. Wee'll make our leysures to attend on yours.
6 90 
6 91 Exeunt. Salarino, and Solanio.
6 92 
6 93   Lor. My Lord Bassanio, since you haue found Anthonio
6 94 We two will leaue you, but at dinner time
6 95 I pray you haue in minde where we must meete
6 96 
6 97    Bass. I will not faile you
6 98 
6 99    Grat. You looke not well signior Anthonio,
6 100 You haue too much respect vpon the world:
6 101 They loose it that doe buy it with much care,
6 102 Beleeue me you are maruellously chang'd
6 103 
6 104    Ant. I hold the world but as the world Gratiano,
6 105 A stage, where euery man must play a part,
6 106 And mine a sad one
6 107 
6 108    Grati. Let me play the foole,
6 109 With mirth and laughter let old wrinckles come,
6 110 And let my Liuer rather heate with wine,
6 111 Then my heart coole with mortifying grones.
6 112 Why should a man whose bloud is warme within,
6 113 Sit like his Grandsire, cut in Alablaster?
6 114 Sleepe when he wakes? and creep into the Iaundies
6 115 By being peeuish? I tell thee what Anthonio,
6 116 I loue thee, and it is my loue that speakes:
6 117 There are a sort of men, whose visages
6 118 Do creame and mantle like a standing pond,
6 119 And do a wilfull stilnesse entertaine,
6 120 With purpose to be drest in an opinion
6 121 Of wisedome, grauity, profound conceit,
6 122 As who should say, I am sir an Oracle,
6 123 And when I ope my lips, let no dogge barke.
6 124 O my Anthonio, I do know of these
6 125 That therefore onely are reputed wise,
6 126 For saying nothing; when I am verie sure
6 127 If they should speake, would almost dam those eares
6 128 Which hearing them would call their brothers fooles:
6 129 Ile tell thee more of this another time.
6 130 But fish not with this melancholly baite
6 131 For this foole Gudgin, this opinion:
6 132 Come good Lorenzo, faryewell a while,
6 133 Ile end my exhortation after dinner
6 134 
6 135    Lor. Well, we will leaue you then till dinner time.
6 136 I must be one of these same dumbe wise men.
6 137 For Gratiano neuer let's me speake
6 138 
6 139    Gra. Well, keepe me company but two yeares mo,
6 140 Thou shalt not know the sound of thine owne tongue
6 141 
6 142    Ant. Far you well, Ile grow a talker for this geare
6 143 
6 144    Gra. Thankes ifaith, for silence is onely commendable
6 145 In a neats tongue dri'd, and a maid not vendible.
6 146 Enter.
6 147 
6 148   Ant. It is that any thing now
6 149 
6 150    Bas. Gratiano speakes an infinite deale of nothing,
6 151 more then any man in all Venice, his reasons are two
6 152 graines of wheate hid in two bushels of chaffe: you shall
6 153 seeke all day ere you finde them, & when you haue them
6 154 they are not worth the search
6 155 
6 156    An. Well: tel me now, what Lady is the same
6 157 To whom you swore a secret Pilgrimage
6 158 That you to day promis'd to tel me of?
6 159   Bas. Tis not vnknowne to you Anthonio
6 160 How much I haue disabled mine estate,
6 161 By something shewing a more swelling port
6 162 Then my faint meanes would grant continuance:
6 163 Nor do I now make mone to be abridg'd
6 164 From such a noble rate, but my cheefe care
6 165 Is to come fairely off from the great debts
6 166 Wherein my time something too prodigall
6 167 Hath left me gag'd: to you Anthonio
6 168 I owe the most in money, and in loue,
6 169 And from your loue I haue a warrantie
6 170 To vnburthen all my plots and purposes,
6 171 How to get cleere of all the debts I owe
6 172 
6 173    An. I pray you good Bassanio let me know it,
6 174 And if it stand as you your selfe still do,
6 175 Within the eye of honour, be assur'd
6 176 My purse, my person, my extreamest meanes
6 177 Lye all vnlock'd to your occasions
6 178 
6 179    Bass. In my schoole dayes, when I had lost one shaft
6 180 I shot his fellow of the selfesame flight
6 181 The selfesame way, with more aduised watch
6 182 To finde the other forth, and by aduenturing both,
6 183 I oft found both. I vrge this child-hoode proofe,
6 184 Because what followes is pure innocence.
6 185 I owe you much, and like a wilfull youth,
6 186 That which I owe is lost: but if you please
6 187 To shoote another arrow that selfe way
6 188 Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,
6 189 As I will watch the ayme: Or to finde both,
6 190 Or bring your latter hazard backe againe,
6 191 And thankfully rest debter for the first
6 192 
6 193    An. You know me well, and herein spend but time
6 194 To winde about my loue with circumstance,
6 195 And out of doubt you doe more wrong
6 196 In making question of my vttermost
6 197 Then if you had made waste of all I haue:
6 198 Then doe but say to me what I should doe
6 199 That in your knowledge may by me be done,
6 200 And I am prest vnto it: therefore speake
6 201 
6 202    Bass. In Belmont is a Lady richly left,
6 203 And she is faire, and fairer then that word,
6 204 Of wondrous vertues, sometimes from her eyes
6 205 I did receiue faire speechlesse messages:
6 206 Her name is Portia, nothing vndervallewd
6 207 To Cato's daughter, Brutus Portia,
6 208 Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,
6 209 For the four windes blow in from euery coast
6 210 Renowned sutors, and her sunny locks
6 211 Hang on her temples like a golden fleece,
6 212 Which makes her seat of Belmont Cholchos strond,
6 213 And many Iasons come in quest of her.
6 214 O my Anthonio, had I but the meanes
6 215 To hold a riuall place with one of them,
6 216 I haue a minde presages me such thrift,
6 217 That I should questionlesse be fortunate
6 218 
6 219    Anth. Thou knowst that all my fortunes are at sea,
6 220 Neither haue I money, nor commodity
6 221 To raise a present summe, therefore goe forth
6 222 Try what my credit can in Venice doe,
6 223 That shall be rackt euen to the vttermost,
6 224 To furnish thee to Belmont to faire Portia.
6 225 Goe presently enquire, and so will I
6 226 Where money is, and I no question make
6 227 To haue it of my trust, or for my sake.
6 228 
6 229 Exeunt.
6 230 
6 231 Enter Portia with her waiting woman Nerissa.
6 232 
6 233   Portia. By my troth Nerrissa, my little body is a wearie
6 234 of this great world
6 235 
6 236    Ner. You would be sweet Madam, if your miseries
6 237 were in the same abundance as your good fortunes are:
6 238 and yet for ought I see, they are as sicke that surfet with
6 239 too much, as they that starue with nothing; it is no smal
6 240 happinesse therefore to bee seated in the meane, superfluitie
6 241 comes sooner by white haires, but competencie
6 242 liues longer
6 243 
6 244    Portia. Good sentences, and well pronounc'd
6 245 
6 246    Ner. They would be better if well followed
6 247 
6 248    Portia. If to doe were as easie as to know what were
6 249 good to doe, Chappels had beene Churches, and poore
6 250 mens cottages Princes Pallaces: it is a good Diuine that
6 251 followes his owne instructions; I can easier teach twentie
6 252 what were good to be done, then be one of the twentie
6 253 to follow mine owne teaching: the braine may deuise
6 254 lawes for the blood, but a hot temper leapes ore a
6 255 colde decree, such a hare is madnesse the youth, to skip
6 256 ore the meshes of good counsaile the cripple; but this
6 257 reason is not in fashion to choose me a husband: O mee,
6 258 the word choose, I may neither choose whom I would,
6 259 nor refuse whom I dislike, so is the wil of a liuing daughter
6 260 curb'd by the will of a dead father: it is not hard Nerrissa,
6 261 that I cannot choose one, nor refuse none
6 262 
6 263    Ner. Your father was euer vertuous, and holy men
6 264 at their death haue good inspirations, therefore the lotterie
6 265 that hee hath deuised in these three chests of gold,
6 266 siluer, and leade, whereof who chooses his meaning,
6 267 chooses you, wil no doubt neuer be chosen by any rightly,
6 268 but one who you shall rightly loue: but what warmth
6 269 is there in your affection towards any of these Princely
6 270 suters that are already come?
6 271   Por. I pray thee ouer-name them, and as thou namest
6 272 them, I will describe them, and according to my description
6 273 leuell at my affection
6 274 
6 275    Ner. First there is the Neopolitane Prince
6 276 
6 277    Por. I that's a colt indeede, for he doth nothing but
6 278 talke of his horse, and hee makes it a great appropriation
6 279 to his owne good parts that he can shoo him himselfe:
6 280 I am much afraid my Ladie his mother plaid false
6 281 with a Smyth
6 282 
6 283    Ner. Than is there the Countie Palentine
6 284 
6 285    Por. He doth nothing but frowne (as who should
6 286 say, and you will not haue me, choose: he heares merrie
6 287 tales and smiles not, I feare hee will proue the weeping
6 288 Phylosopher when he growes old, being so full of vnmannerly
6 289 sadnesse in his youth.) I had rather to be married
6 290 to a deaths head with a bone in his mouth, then to either
6 291 of these: God defend me from these two
6 292 
6 293    Ner. How say you by the French Lord, Mounsier
6 294 Le Boune?
6 295   Por. God made him, and therefore let him passe for a
6 296 man, in truth I know it is a sinne to be a mocker, but he,
6 297 why he hath a horse better then the Neopolitans, a better
6 298 bad habite of frowning then the Count Palentine, he
6 299 is euery man in no man, if a Trassell sing, he fals straight
6 300 a capring, he will fence with his owne shadow. If I should
6 301 marry him, I should marry twentie husbands: if hee
6 302 would despise me, I would forgiue him, for if he loue me
6 303 to madnesse, I should neuer requite him
6 304 
6 305    Ner. What say you then to Fauconbridge, the yong
6 306 Baron of England?
6 307   Por. You know I say nothing to him, for hee vnderstands
6 308 not me, nor I him: he hath neither Latine, French,
6 309 nor Italian, and you will come into the Court & sweare
6 310 that I haue a poore pennie-worth in the English: hee is a
6 311 proper mans picture, but alas who can conuerse with a
6 312 dumbe show? how odly he is suited, I thinke he bought
6 313 his doublet in Italie, his round hose in France, his bonnet
6 314 in Germanie, and his behauiour euery where
6 315 
6 316    Ner. What thinke you of the other Lord his neighbour?
6 317   Por. That he hath a neighbourly charitie in him, for
6 318 he borrowed a boxe of the eare of the Englishman, and
6 319 swore he would pay him againe when hee was able: I
6 320 thinke the Frenchman became his suretie, and seald vnder
6 321 for another
6 322 
6 323    Ner. How like you the yong Germaine, the Duke of
6 324 Saxonies Nephew?
6 325   Por. Very vildely in the morning when hee is sober,
6 326 and most vildely in the afternoone when hee is drunke:
6 327 when he is best, he is a little worse then a man, and when
6 328 he is worst, he is little better then a beast: and the worst
6 329 fall that euer fell, I hope I shall make shift to go without
6 330 him
6 331 
6 332    Ner. If he should offer to choose, and choose the right
6 333 Casket, you should refuse to performe your Fathers will,
6 334 if you should refuse to accept him
6 335 
6 336    Por. Therefore for feare of the worst, I pray thee set
6 337 a deepe glasse of Reinish-wine on the contrary Casket,
6 338 for if the diuell be within, and that temptation without,
6 339 I know he will choose it. I will doe any thing Nerrissa
6 340 ere I will be married to a spunge
6 341 
6 342    Ner. You neede not feare Lady the hauing any of
6 343 these Lords, they haue acquainted me with their determinations,
6 344 which is indeede to returne to their home,
6 345 and to trouble you with no more suite, vnlesse you may
6 346 be won by some other sort then your Fathers imposition,
6 347 depending on the Caskets
6 348 
6 349    Por. If I liue to be as olde as Sibilla, I will dye as
6 350 chaste as Diana: vnlesse I be obtained by the manner
6 351 of my Fathers will: I am glad this parcell of wooers
6 352 are so reasonable, for there is not one among them but
6 353 I doate on his verie absence: and I wish them a faire departure
6 354 
6 355    Ner. Doe you not remember Ladie in your Fathers
6 356 time, a Venecian, a Scholler and a Souldior that
6 357 came hither in companie of the Marquesse of Mountferrat?
6 358   Por. Yes, yes, it was Bassanio, as I thinke, so was hee
6 359 call'd
6 360 
6 361    Ner. True Madam, hee of all the men that euer my
6 362 foolish eyes look'd vpon, was the best deseruing a faire
6 363 Lady
6 364 
6 365    Por. I remember him well, and I remember him worthy
6 366 of thy praise.
6 367 Enter a Seruingman.
6 368 
6 369   Ser. The four Strangers seeke you Madam to take
6 370 their leaue: and there is a fore-runner come from a fift,
6 371 the Prince of Moroco, who brings word the Prince his
6 372 Maister will be here to night
6 373 
6 374    Por. If I could bid the fift welcome with so good
6 375 heart as I can bid the other foure farewell, I should be
6 376 glad of his approach: if he haue the condition of a Saint,
6 377 and the complexion of a diuell, I had rather hee should
6 378 shriue me then wiue me. Come Nerrissa, sirra go before;
6 379 whiles wee shut the gate vpon one wooer, another
6 380 knocks at the doore.
6 381 
6 382 Exeunt.
6 383 
6 384 Enter Bassanio with Shylocke the Iew.
6 385 
6 386   Shy. Three thousand ducates, well
6 387 
6 388    Bass. I sir, for three months
6 389 
6 390    Shy. For three months, well
6 391 
6 392    Bass. For the which, as I told you,
6 393 Anthonio shall be bound
6 394 
6 395    Shy. Anthonio shall become bound, well
6 396 
6 397    Bass. May you sted me? Will you pleasure me?
6 398 Shall I know your answere
6 399 
6 400    Shy. Three thousand ducats for three months,
6 401 and Anthonio bound
6 402 
6 403    Bass. Your answere to that
6 404 
6 405    Shy. Anthonio is a good man
6 406 
6 407    Bass. Haue you heard any imputation to the contrary
6 408 
6 409    Shy. Ho no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is a
6 410 good man, is to haue you vnderstand me that he is sufficient,
6 411 yet his meanes are in supposition: he hath an Argosie
6 412 bound to Tripolis, another to the Indies, I vnderstand
6 413 moreouer vpon the Ryalta, he hath a third at Mexico,
6 414 a fourth for England, and other ventures hee hath
6 415 squandred abroad, but ships are but boords, Saylers but
6 416 men, there be land rats, and water rats, water theeues,
6 417 and land theeues, I meane Pyrats, and then there is the
6 418 perrill of waters, windes, and rocks: the man is not withstanding
6 419 sufficient, three thousand ducats, I thinke I may
6 420 take his bond
6 421 
6 422    Bas. Be assured you may
6 423 
6 424    Iew. I will be assured I may: and that I may be assured,
6 425 I will bethinke mee, may I speake with Anthonio?
6 426   Bass. If it please you to dine with vs
6 427 
6 428    Iew. Yes, to smell porke, to eate of the habitation
6 429 which your Prophet the Nazarite coniured the diuell
6 430 into: I will buy with you, sell with you, talke with
6 431 you, walke with you, and so following: but I will
6 432 not eate with you, drinke with you, nor pray with you.
6 433 What newes on the Ryalta, who is he comes here?
6 434 Enter Anthonio.
6 435 
6 436   Bass. This is signior Anthonio
6 437 
6 438    Iew. How like a fawning publican he lookes.
6 439 I hate him for he is a Christian:
6 440 But more, for that in low simplicitie
6 441 He lends out money gratis, and brings downe
6 442 The rate of vsance here with vs in Venice.
6 443 If I can catch him once vpon the hip,
6 444 I will feede fat the ancient grudge I beare him.
6 445 He hates our sacred Nation, and he railes
6 446 Euen there where Merchants most doe congregate
6 447 On me, my bargaines, and my well-worne thrift,
6 448 Which he cals interrest: Cursed by my Trybe
6 449 If I forgiue him
6 450 
6 451    Bass. Shylock, doe you heare
6 452 
6 453    Shy. I am debating of my present store,
6 454 And by the neere gesse of my memorie
6 455 I cannot instantly raise vp the grosse
6 456 Of full three thousand ducats: what of that?
6 457 Tuball a wealthy Hebrew of my Tribe
6 458 Will furnish me: but soft, how many months
6 459 Doe you desire? Rest you faire good signior,
6 460 Your worship was the last man in our mouthes
6 461 
6 462    Ant. Shylocke, albeit I neither lend nor borrow
6 463 By taking, nor by giuing of excesse,
6 464 Yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend,
6 465 Ile breake a custome: is he yet possest
6 466 How much he would?
6 467   Shy. I, I, three thousand ducats
6 468 
6 469    Ant. And for three months
6 470 
6 471    Shy. I had forgot, three months, you told me so.
6 472 Well then, your bond: and let me see, but heare you,
6 473 Me thoughts you said, you neither lend nor borrow
6 474 Vpon aduantage
6 475 
6 476    Ant. I doe neuer vse it
6 477 
6 478    Shy. When Iacob graz'd his vncle Labans sheepe,
6 479 This Iacob from our holy Abram was
6 480 (As his wise mother wrought in his behalfe)
6 481 The third possesser; I, he was the third
6 482 
6 483    Ant. And what of him, did he take interrest?
6 484   Shy. No, not take interest, not as you would say
6 485 Directly interest, marke what Iacob did,
6 486 When Laban and himselfe were compremyz'd
6 487 That all the eanelings which were streakt and pied
6 488 Should fall as Iacobs hier, the Ewes being rancke,
6 489 In end of Autumne turned to the Rammes,
6 490 And when the worke of generation was
6 491 Betweene these woolly breeders in the act,
6 492 The skilfull shepheard pil'd me certaine wands,
6 493 And in the dooing of the deede of kinde,
6 494 He stucke them vp before the fulsome Ewes,
6 495 Who then conceauing, did in eaning time
6 496 Fall party-colour'd lambs, and those were Iacobs.
6 497 This was a way to thriue, and he was blest:
6 498 And thrift is blessing if men steale it not
6 499 
6 500    Ant. This was a venture sir that Iacob seru'd for,
6 501 A thing not in his power to bring to passe,
6 502 But sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of heauen.
6 503 Was this inserted to make interrest good?
6 504 Or is your gold and siluer Ewes and Rams?
6 505   Shy. I cannot tell, I make it breede as fast,
6 506 But note me signior
6 507 
6 508    Ant. Marke you this Bassanio,
6 509 The diuell can cite Scripture for his purpose,
6 510 An euill soule producing holy witnesse,
6 511 Is like a villaine with a smiling cheeke,
6 512 A goodly apple rotten at the heart.
6 513 O what a goodly outside falsehood hath
6 514 
6 515    Shy. Three thousand ducats, 'tis a good round sum.
6 516 Three months from twelue, then let me see the rate
6 517 
6 518    Ant. Well Shylocke, shall we be beholding to you?
6 519   Shy. Signior Anthonio, many a time and oft
6 520 In the Ryalto you haue rated me
6 521 About my monies and my vsances:
6 522 Still haue I borne it with a patient shrug,
6 523 (For suffrance is the badge of all our Tribe.)
6 524 You call me misbeleeuer, cut-throate dog,
6 525 And spet vpon my Iewish gaberdine,
6 526 And all for vse of that which is mine owne.
6 527 Well then, it now appeares you neede my helpe:
6 528 Goe to then, you come to me, and you say,
6 529 Shylocke, we would haue moneyes, you say so:
6 530 You that did voide your rume vpon my beard,
6 531 And foote me as you spurne a stranger curre
6 532 Ouer your threshold, moneyes is your suite.
6 533 What should I say to you? Should I not say,
6 534 Hath a dog money? Is it possible
6 535 A curre should lend three thousand ducats? or
6 536 Shall I bend low, and in a bond-mans key
6 537 With bated breath, and whispring humblenesse,
6 538 Say this: Faire sir, you spet on me on Wednesday last;
6 539 You spurn'd me such a day; another time
6 540 You cald me dog: and for these curtesies
6 541 Ile lend you thus much moneyes
6 542 
6 543    Ant. I am as like to call thee so againe,
6 544 To spet on thee againe, to spurne thee too.
6 545 If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not
6 546 As to thy friends, for when did friendship take
6 547 A breede of barraine mettall of his friend?
6 548 But lend it rather to thine enemie,
6 549 Who if he breake, thou maist with better face
6 550 Exact the penalties
6 551 
6 552    Shy. Why looke you how you storme,
6 553 I would be friends with you, and haue your loue,
6 554 Forget the shames that you haue staind me with,
6 555 Supplie your present wants, and take no doite
6 556 Of vsance for my moneyes, and youle not heare me,
6 557 This is kinde I offer
6 558 
6 559    Bass. This were kindnesse
6 560 
6 561    Shy. This kindnesse will I showe,
6 562 Goe with me to a Notarie, seale me there
6 563 Your single bond, and in a merrie sport
6 564 If you repaie me not on such a day,
6 565 In such a place, such sum or sums as are
6 566 Exprest in the condition, let the forfeite
6 567 Be nominated for an equall pound
6 568 Of your faire flesh, to be cut off and taken
6 569 In what part of your bodie it pleaseth me
6 570 
6 571    Ant. Content infaith, Ile seale to such a bond,
6 572 And say there is much kindnesse in the Iew
6 573 
6 574    Bass. You shall not seale to such a bond for me,
6 575 Ile rather dwell in my necessitie
6 576 
6 577    Ant. Why feare not man, I will not forfaite it,
6 578 Within these two months, that's a month before
6 579 This bond expires, I doe expect returne
6 580 Of thrice three times the valew of this bond
6 581 
6 582    Shy. O father Abram, what these Christians are,
6 583 Whose owne hard dealings teaches them suspect
6 584 The thoughts of others: Praie you tell me this,
6 585 If he should breake his daie, what should I gaine
6 586 By the exaction of the forfeiture?
6 587 A pound of mans flesh taken from a man,
6 588 Is not so estimable, profitable neither
6 589 As flesh of Muttons, Beefes, or Goates, I say
6 590 To buy his fauour, I extend this friendship,
6 591 If he will take it, so: if not adiew,
6 592 And for my loue I praie you wrong me not
6 593 
6 594    Ant. Yes Shylocke, I will seale vnto this bond
6 595 
6 596    Shy. Then meete me forthwith at the Notaries,
6 597 Giue him direction for this merrie bond,
6 598 And I will goe and purse the ducats straite.
6 599 See to my house left in the fearefull gard
6 600 Of an vnthriftie knaue: and presentlie
6 601 Ile be with you.
6 602 Enter.
6 603 
6 604   Ant. Hie thee gentle Iew. This Hebrew will turne
6 605 Christian, he growes kinde
6 606 
6 607    Bass. I like not faire tearmes, and a villaines minde
6 608 
6 609    Ant. Come on, in this there can be no dismaie,
6 610 My Shippes come home a month before the daie.
6 611 
6 612 Exeunt.
6 613 
6 614 
6 615 Actus Secundus.
6 616 
6 617 Enter Morochus a tawnie Moore all in white, and three or foure
6 618 followers
6 619 accordingly, with Portia, Nerrissa, and their traine. Flo. Cornets.
6 620 
6 621   Mor. Mislike me not for my complexion,
6 622 The shadowed liuerie of the burnisht sunne,
6 623 To whom I am a neighbour, and neere bred.
6 624 Bring me the fairest creature North-ward borne,
6 625 Where Phoebus fire scarce thawes the ysicles,
6 626 And let vs make incision for your loue,
6 627 To proue whose blood is reddest, his or mine.
6 628 I tell thee Ladie this aspect of mine
6 629 Hath feard the valiant, (by my loue I sweare)
6 630 The best regarded Virgins of our Clyme
6 631 Haue lou'd it to: I would not change this hue,
6 632 Except to steale your thoughts my gentle Queene
6 633 
6 634    Por. In tearmes of choise I am not solie led
6 635 By nice direction of a maidens eies:
6 636 Besides, the lottrie of my destenie
6 637 Bars me the right of voluntarie choosing:
6 638 But if my Father had not scanted me,
6 639 And hedg'd me by his wit to yeelde my selfe
6 640 His wife, who wins me by that meanes I told you,
6 641 Your selfe (renowned Prince) than stood as faire
6 642 As any commer I haue look'd on yet
6 643 For my affection
6 644 
6 645    Mor. Euen for that I thanke you,
6 646 Therefore I pray you leade me to the Caskets
6 647 To trie my fortune: By this Symitare
6 648 That slew the Sophie, and a Persian Prince
6 649 That won three fields of Sultan Solyman,
6 650 I would ore-stare the sternest eies that looke:
6 651 Out-braue the heart most daring on the earth:
6 652 Plucke the yong sucking Cubs from the she Beare,
6 653 Yea, mocke the Lion when he rores for pray
6 654 To win the Ladie. But alas, the while
6 655 If Hercules and Lychas plaie at dice
6 656 Which is the better man, the greater throw
6 657 May turne by fortune from the weaker hand:
6 658 So is Alcides beaten by his rage,
6 659 And so may I, blinde fortune leading me
6 660 Misse that which one vnworthier may attaine,
6 661 And die with grieuing
6 662 
6 663    Port. You must take your chance,
6 664 And either not attempt to choose at all,
6 665 Or sweare before you choose, if you choose wrong
6 666 Neuer to speake to Ladie afterward
6 667 In way of marriage, therefore be aduis'd
6 668 
6 669    Mor. Nor will not, come bring me vnto my chance
6 670 
6 671    Por. First forward to the temple, after dinner
6 672 Your hazard shall be made
6 673 
6 674    Mor. Good fortune then,
6 675 
6 676 Cornets.
6 677 
6 678 To make me blest or cursed'st among men.
6 679 
6 680 Exeunt.
6 681 
6 682 Enter the Clowne alone.
6 683 
6 684   Clo. Certainely, my conscience will serue me to run
6 685 from this Iew my Maister: the fiend is at mine elbow,
6 686 and tempts me, saying to me, Iobbe, Launcelet Iobbe, good
6 687 Launcelet, or good Iobbe, or good Launcelet Iobbe, vse
6 688 your legs, take the start, run awaie: my conscience saies
6 689 no; take heede honest Launcelet, take heed honest Iobbe,
6 690 or as afore-said honest Launcelet Iobbe, doe not runne,
6 691 scorne running with thy heeles; well, the most coragious
6 692 fiend bids me packe, fia saies the fiend, away saies
6 693 the fiend, for the heauens rouse vp a braue minde saies
6 694 the fiend, and run; well, my conscience hanging about
6 695 the necke of my heart, saies verie wisely to me: my honest
6 696 friend Launcelet, being an honest mans sonne, or rather
6 697 an honest womans sonne, for indeede my Father did
6 698 something smack, something grow too; he had a kinde of
6 699 taste; wel, my conscience saies Lancelet bouge not, bouge
6 700 saies the fiend, bouge not saies my conscience, conscience
6 701 say I you counsaile well, fiend say I you counsaile well,
6 702 to be rul'd by my conscience I should stay with the Iew
6 703 my Maister, (who God blesse the marke) is a kinde of diuell;
6 704 and to run away from the Iew I should be ruled by
6 705 the fiend, who sauing your reuerence is the diuell himselfe:
6 706 certainely the Iew is the verie diuell incarnation,
6 707 and in my conscience, my conscience is a kinde of hard
6 708 conscience, to offer to counsaile me to stay with the Iew;
6 709 the fiend giues the more friendly counsaile: I will runne
6 710 fiend, my heeles are at your commandement, I will
6 711 runne.
6 712 Enter old Gobbe with a Basket.
6 713 
6 714   Gob. Maister yong-man, you I praie you, which is the
6 715 waie to Maister Iewes?
6 716   Lan. O heauens, this is my true begotten Father, who
6 717 being more then sand-blinde, high grauel blinde, knows
6 718 me not, I will trie confusions with him
6 719 
6 720 
6 721    Gob. Maister yong Gentleman, I praie you which is
6 722 the waie to Maister Iewes
6 723 
6 724    Laun. Turne vpon your right hand at the next turning,
6 725 but at the next turning of all on your left; marrie
6 726 at the verie next turning, turne of no hand, but turn down
6 727 indirectlie to the Iewes house
6 728 
6 729    Gob. Be Gods sonties 'twill be a hard waie to hit, can
6 730 you tell me whether one Launcelet that dwels with him
6 731 dwell with him or no
6 732 
6 733    Laun. Talke you of yong Master Launcelet, marke
6 734 me now, now will I raise the waters; talke you of yong
6 735 Maister Launcelet?
6 736   Gob. No Maister sir, but a poore mans sonne, his Father
6 737 though I say't is an honest exceeding poore man,
6 738 and God be thanked well to liue
6 739 
6 740    Lan. Well, let his Father be what a will, wee talke of
6 741 yong Maister Launcelet
6 742 
6 743    Gob. Your worships friend and Launcelet
6 744 
6 745    Laun. But I praie you ergo old man, ergo I beseech you,
6 746 talke you of yong Maister Launcelet
6 747 
6 748    Gob. Of Launcelet, ant please your maistership
6 749 
6 750    Lan. Ergo Maister Lancelet, talke not of maister Lancelet
6 751 Father, for the yong gentleman according to fates and
6 752 destinies, and such odde sayings, the sisters three, & such
6 753 branches of learning, is indeede deceased, or as you
6 754 would say in plaine tearmes, gone to heauen
6 755 
6 756    Gob. Marrie God forbid, the boy was the verie staffe
6 757 of my age, my verie prop
6 758 
6 759    Lau. Do I look like a cudgell or a houell-post, a staffe
6 760 or a prop: doe you know me Father
6 761 
6 762    Gob. Alacke the day, I know you not yong Gentleman,
6 763 but I praie you tell me, is my boy God rest his soule
6 764 aliue or dead
6 765 
6 766    Lan. Doe you not know me Father
6 767 
6 768    Gob. Alacke sir I am sand blinde, I know you not
6 769 
6 770    Lan. Nay, indeede if you had your eies you might
6 771 faile of the knowing me: it is a wise Father that knowes
6 772 his owne childe. Well, old man, I will tell you newes of
6 773 your son, giue me your blessing, truth will come to light,
6 774 murder cannot be hid long, a mans sonne may, but in the
6 775 end truth will out
6 776 
6 777    Gob. Praie you sir stand vp, I am sure you are not
6 778 Lancelet my boy
6 779 
6 780    Lan. Praie you let's haue no more fooling about
6 781 it, but giue mee your blessing: I am Lancelet your
6 782 boy that was, your sonne that is, your childe that
6 783 shall be
6 784 
6 785    Gob. I cannot thinke you are my sonne
6 786 
6 787    Lan. I know not what I shall thinke of that: but I am
6 788 Lancelet the Iewes man, and I am sure Margerie your wife
6 789 is my mother
6 790 
6 791    Gob. Her name is Margerie indeede, Ile be sworne if
6 792 thou be Lancelet, thou art mine owne flesh and blood:
6 793 Lord worshipt might he be, what a beard hast thou got;
6 794 thou hast got more haire on thy chin, then Dobbin my
6 795 philhorse has on his taile
6 796 
6 797    Lan. It should seeme then that Dobbins taile
6 798 growes backeward. I am sure he had more haire of his
6 799 taile then I haue of my face when I last saw him
6 800 
6 801    Gob. Lord how art thou chang'd: how doost thou
6 802 and thy Master agree, I haue brought him a present; how
6 803 gree you now?
6 804   Lan. Well, well, but for mine owne part, as I haue set
6 805 vp my rest to run awaie, so I will not rest till I haue run
6 806 some ground; my Maister's a verie Iew, giue him a present,
6 807 giue him a halter, I am famisht in his seruice. You
6 808 may tell euerie finger I haue with my ribs: Father I am
6 809 glad you are come, giue me your present to one Maister
6 810 Bassanio, who indeede giues rare new Liuories, if I serue
6 811 not him, I will run as far as God has anie ground. O rare
6 812 fortune, here comes the man, to him Father, for I am a
6 813 Iew if I serue the Iew anie longer.
6 814 Enter Bassanio with a follower or two.
6 815 
6 816   Bass. You may doe so, but let it be so hasted that
6 817 supper be readie at the farthest by fiue of the clocke:
6 818 see these Letters deliuered, put the Liueries to making,
6 819 and desire Gratiano to come anone to my lodging
6 820 
6 821    Lan. To him Father
6 822 
6 823    Gob. God blesse your worship
6 824 
6 825    Bass. Gramercie, would'st thou ought with me
6 826 
6 827    Gob. Here's my sonne sir, a poore boy
6 828 
6 829    Lan. Not a poore boy sir, but the rich Iewes man that
6 830 would sir as my Father shall specifie
6 831 
6 832    Gob. He hath a great infection sir, as one would say
6 833 to serue
6 834 
6 835    Lan. Indeede the short and the long is, I serue the
6 836 Iew, and haue a desire as my Father shall specifie
6 837 
6 838    Gob. His Maister and he (sauing your worships reuerence)
6 839 are scarce catercosins
6 840 
6 841    Lan. To be briefe, the verie truth is, that the Iew
6 842 hauing done me wrong, doth cause me as my Father being
6 843 I hope an old man shall frutifie vnto you
6 844 
6 845    Gob. I haue here a dish of Doues that I would bestow
6 846 vpon your worship, and my suite is
6 847 
6 848    Lan. In verie briefe, the suite is impertinent to my
6 849 selfe, as your worship shall know by this honest old man,
6 850 and though I say it, though old man, yet poore man my
6 851 Father
6 852 
6 853    Bass. One speake for both, what would you?
6 854   Lan. Serue you sir
6 855 
6 856    Gob. That is the verie defect of the matter sir
6 857 
6 858    Bass. I know thee well, thou hast obtain'd thy suite,
6 859 Shylocke thy Maister spoke with me this daie,
6 860 And hath prefer'd thee, if it be preferment
6 861 To leaue a rich Iewes seruice, to become
6 862 The follower of so poore a Gentleman
6 863 
6 864    Clo. The old prouerbe is verie well parted betweene
6 865 my Maister Shylocke and you sir, you haue the grace of
6 866 God sir, and he hath enough
6 867 
6 868    Bass. Thou speak'st well; go Father with thy Son,
6 869 Take leaue of thy old Maister, and enquire
6 870 My lodging out, giue him a Liuerie
6 871 More garded then his fellowes: see it done
6 872 
6 873    Clo. Father in, I cannot get a seruice, no, I haue nere
6 874 a tongue in my head, well: if anie man in Italie haue a
6 875 fairer table which doth offer to sweare vpon a booke, I
6 876 shall haue good fortune; goe too, here's a simple line
6 877 of life, here's a small trifle of wiues, alas, fifteene wiues
6 878 is nothing, a leuen widdowes and nine maides is a simple
6 879 comming in for one man, and then to scape drowning
6 880 thrice, and to be in perill of my life with the edge
6 881 of a featherbed, here are simple scapes: well, if Fortune
6 882 be a woman, she's a good wench for this gere: Father
6 883 come, Ile take my leaue of the Iew in the twinkling.
6 884 
6 885 Exit Clowne.
6 886 
6 887   Bass. I praie thee good Leonardo thinke on this,
6 888 These things being bought and orderly bestowed
6 889 Returne in haste, for I doe feast to night
6 890 My best esteemd acquaintance, hie thee goe
6 891 
6 892    Leon. my best endeuors shall be done herein.
6 893 
6 894 Exit Le.
6 895 
6 896 Enter Gratiano.
6 897 
6 898   Gra. Where's your Maister
6 899 
6 900    Leon. Yonder sir he walkes
6 901 
6 902    Gra. Signior Bassanio
6 903 
6 904    Bas. Gratiano
6 905 
6 906    Gra. I haue a sute to you
6 907 
6 908    Bass. You haue obtain'd it
6 909 
6 910    Gra. You must not denie me, I must goe with you to
6 911 Belmont
6 912 
6 913    Bass. Why then you must: but heare thee Gratiano,
6 914 Thou art to wilde, to rude, and bold of voyce,
6 915 Parts that become thee happily enough,
6 916 And in such eyes as ours appeare not faults;
6 917 But where they are not knowne, why there they show
6 918 Something too liberall, pray thee take paine
6 919 To allay with some cold drops of modestie
6 920 Thy skipping spirit, least through thy wilde behauiour
6 921 I be misconsterd in the place I goe to,
6 922 And loose my hopes
6 923 
6 924    Gra. Signor Bassanio, heare me,
6 925 If I doe not put on a sober habite,
6 926 Talke with respect, and sweare but now and than,
6 927 Weare prayer bookes in my pocket, looke demurely,
6 928 Nay more, while grace is saying hood mine eyes
6 929 Thus with my hat, and sigh and say Amen:
6 930 Vse all the obseruance of ciuillitie
6 931 Like one well studied in a sad ostent
6 932 To please his Grandam, neuer trust me more
6 933 
6 934    Bas. Well, we shall see your bearing
6 935 
6 936    Gra. Nay but I barre to night, you shall not gage me
6 937 By what we doe to night
6 938 
6 939    Bas. No that were pittie,
6 940 I would intreate you rather to put on
6 941 Your boldest suite of mirth, for we haue friends
6 942 That purpose merriment: but far you well,
6 943 I haue some businesse
6 944 
6 945    Gra. And I must to Lorenso and the rest,
6 946 But we will visite you at supper time.
6 947 
6 948 Exeunt.
6 949 
6 950 Enter Iessica and the Clowne.
6 951 
6 952   Ies. I am sorry thou wilt leaue my Father so,
6 953 Our house is hell, and thou a merrie diuell
6 954 Did'st rob it of some taste of tediousnesse;
6 955 But far thee well, there is a ducat for thee,
6 956 And Lancelet, soone at supper shalt thou see
6 957 Lorenzo, who is thy new Maisters guest,
6 958 Giue him this Letter, doe it secretly,
6 959 And so farewell: I would not haue my Father
6 960 see me talke with thee
6 961 
6 962 
6 963    Clo. Adue, teares exhibit my tongue, most beautifull
6 964 Pagan, most sweete Iew, if a Christian doe not play the
6 965 knaue and get thee, I am much deceiued; but adue, these
6 966 foolish drops doe somewhat drowne my manly spirit:
6 967 adue.
6 968 Enter.
6 969 
6 970   Ies. Farewell good Lancelet.
6 971 Alacke, what hainous sinne is it in me
6 972 To be ashamed to be my Fathers childe,
6 973 But though I am a daughter to his blood,
6 974 I am not to his manners: O Lorenzo,
6 975 If thou keepe promise I shall end this strife,
6 976 Become a Christian, and thy louing wife.
6 977 Enter.
6 978 
6 979 Enter Gratiano, Lorenzo, Salarino, and Salanio.
6 980 
6 981   Lor. Nay, we will slinke away in supper time,
6 982 Disguise vs at my lodging, and returne all in an houre
6 983 
6 984    Gra. We haue not made good preparation
6 985 
6 986    Sal. We haue not spoke vs yet of Torch-bearers
6 987 
6 988    Sol. 'Tis vile vnlesse it may be quaintly ordered,
6 989 And better in my minde not vndertooke
6 990 
6 991    Lor. 'Tis now but foure of clock, we haue two houres
6 992 To furnish vs; friend Lancelet what's the newes.
6 993 Enter Lancelet with a Letter.
6 994 
6 995   Lan. And it shall please you to breake vp this, shall it
6 996 seeme to signifie
6 997 
6 998    Lor. I know the hand, in faith 'tis a faire hand
6 999 And whiter then the paper it writ on,
6 1000 Is the faire hand that writ
6 1001 
6 1002    Gra. Loue newes in faith
6 1003 
6 1004    Lan. By your leaue sir
6 1005 
6 1006    Lor. Whither goest thou?
6 1007   Lan. Marry sir to bid my old Master the Iew to sup
6 1008 to night with my new Master the Christian
6 1009 
6 1010    Lor. Hold here, take this, tell gentle Iessica
6 1011 I will not faile her, speake it priuately:
6 1012 Go Gentlemen, will you prepare you for this Maske to
6 1013 night,
6 1014 I am prouided of a Torch-bearer.
6 1015 
6 1016 Exit. Clowne
6 1017 
6 1018    Sal. I marry, ile be gone about it strait
6 1019 
6 1020    Sol. And so will I
6 1021 
6 1022    Lor. Meete me and Gratiano at Gratianos lodging
6 1023 Some houre hence
6 1024 
6 1025    Sal. 'Tis good we do so.
6 1026 Enter.
6 1027 
6 1028   Gra. Was not that Letter from faire Iessica?
6 1029   Lor. I must needes tell thee all, she hath directed
6 1030 How I shall take her from her Fathers house,
6 1031 What gold and iewels she is furnisht with,
6 1032 What Pages suite she hath in readinesse:
6 1033 If ere the Iew her Father come to heauen,
6 1034 It will be for his gentle daughters sake;
6 1035 And neuer dare misfortune crosse her foote,
6 1036 Vnlesse she doe it vnder this excuse,
6 1037 That she is issue to a faithlesse Iew:
6 1038 Come goe with me, pervse this as thou goest,
6 1039 Faire Iessica shall be my Torch-bearer.
6 1040 Enter.
6 1041 
6 1042 Enter Iew, and his man that was the Clowne.
6 1043 
6 1044   Iew. Well, thou shall see, thy eyes shall be thy iudge,
6 1045 The difference of old Shylocke and Bassanio;
6 1046 What Iessica, thou shalt not gurmandize
6 1047 As thou hast done with me: what Iessica?
6 1048 And sleepe, and snore, and rend apparrell out.
6 1049 Why Iessica I say
6 1050 
6 1051    Clo. Why Iessica
6 1052 
6 1053    Shy. Who bids thee call? I do not bid thee call
6 1054 
6 1055    Clo. Your worship was wont to tell me
6 1056 I could doe nothing without bidding.
6 1057 Enter Iessica.
6 1058 
6 1059   Ies. Call you? what is your will?
6 1060   Shy. I am bid forth to supper Iessica,
6 1061 There are my Keyes: but wherefore should I go?
6 1062 I am not bid for loue, they flatter me,
6 1063 But yet Ile goe in hate, to feede vpon
6 1064 The prodigall Christian. Iessica my girle,
6 1065 Looke to my house, I am right loath to goe,
6 1066 There is some ill a bruing towards my rest,
6 1067 For I did dreame of money bags to night
6 1068 
6 1069    Clo. I beseech you sir goe, my yong Master
6 1070 Doth expect your reproach
6 1071 
6 1072    Shy. So doe I his
6 1073 
6 1074    Clo. And they haue conspired together, I will not say
6 1075 you shall see a Maske, but if you doe, then it was not for
6 1076 nothing that my nose fell a bleeding on blacke monday
6 1077 last, at six a clocke ith morning, falling out that yeere on
6 1078 ashwensday was foure yeere in th' afternoone
6 1079 
6 1080    Shy. What are their maskes? heare you me Iessica,
6 1081 Lock vp my doores, and when you heare the drum
6 1082 And the vile squealing of the wry-neckt Fife,
6 1083 Clamber not you vp to the casements then,
6 1084 Nor thrust your head into the publique streete
6 1085 To gaze on Christian fooles with varnisht faces:
6 1086 But stop my houses eares, I meane my casements,
6 1087 Let not the sound of shallow fopperie enter
6 1088 My sober house. By Iacobs staffe I sweare,
6 1089 I haue no minde of feasting forth to night:
6 1090 But I will goe: goe you before me sirra,
6 1091 Say I will come
6 1092 
6 1093    Clo. I will goe before sir,
6 1094 Mistris looke out at window for all this;
6 1095 There will come a Christian by,
6 1096 Will be worth a Iewes eye
6 1097 
6 1098    Shy. What saies that foole of Hagars off-spring?
6 1099 ha
6 1100 
6 1101    Ies. His words were farewell mistris, nothing else
6 1102 
6 1103    Shy. The patch is kinde enough, but a huge feeder:
6 1104 Snaile-slow in profit, but he sleepes by day
6 1105 More then the wilde-cat: drones hiue not with me,
6 1106 Therefore I part with him, and part with him
6 1107 To one that I would haue him helpe to waste
6 1108 His borrowed purse. Well Iessica goe in,
6 1109 Perhaps I will returne immediately;
6 1110 Doe as I bid you, shut dores after you, fast binde, fast
6 1111 finde,
6 1112 A prouerbe neuer stale in thriftie minde.
6 1113 Enter.
6 1114 
6 1115   Ies. Farewell, and if my fortune be not crost,
6 1116 I haue a Father, you a daughter lost.
6 1117 Enter.
6 1118 
6 1119 Enter the Maskers, Gratiano and Salino.
6 1120 
6 1121   Gra. This is the penthouse vnder which Lorenzo
6 1122 Desired vs to make a stand
6 1123 
6 1124    Sal. His houre is almost past
6 1125 
6 1126    Gra. And it is meruaile he out-dwels his houre,
6 1127 For louers euer run before the clocke
6 1128 
6 1129    Sal. O ten times faster Venus Pidgions flye
6 1130 To steale loues bonds new made, then they are wont
6 1131 To keepe obliged faith vnforfaited
6 1132 
6 1133    Gra. That euer holds, who riseth from a feast
6 1134 With that keene appetite that he sits downe?
6 1135 Where is the horse that doth vntread againe
6 1136 His tedious measures with the vnbated fire,
6 1137 That he did pace them first: all things that are,
6 1138 Are with more spirit chased then enioy'd.
6 1139 How like a yonger or a prodigall
6 1140 The skarfed barke puts from her natiue bay,
6 1141 Hudg'd and embraced by the strumpet winde:
6 1142 How like a prodigall doth she returne
6 1143 With ouer-wither'd ribs and ragged sailes,
6 1144 Leane, rent, and begger'd by the strumpet winde?
6 1145 Enter Lorenzo.
6 1146 
6 1147   Salino. Heere comes Lorenzo, more of this hereafter
6 1148 
6 1149    Lor. Sweete friends, your patience for my long abode,
6 1150 Not I, but my affaires haue made you wait;
6 1151 When you shall please to play the theeues for wiues
6 1152 Ile watch as long for you then: approach
6 1153 Here dwels my father Iew. Hoa, who's within?
6 1154 
6 1155 Iessica aboue.
6 1156 
6 1157   Iess. Who are you? tell me for more certainty,
6 1158 Albeit Ile sweare that I do know your tongue
6 1159 
6 1160    Lor. Lorenzo, and thy Loue
6 1161 
6 1162    Ies. Lorenzo certaine, and my loue indeed,
6 1163 For who loue I so much? and now who knowes
6 1164 But you Lorenzo, whether I am yours?
6 1165   Lor. Heauen and thy thoughts are witness that thou
6 1166 art
6 1167 
6 1168    Ies. Heere, catch this casket, it is worth the paines,
6 1169 I am glad 'tis night, you do not looke on me,
6 1170 For I am much asham'd of my exchange:
6 1171 But loue is blinde, and louers cannot see
6 1172 The pretty follies that themselues commit,
6 1173 For if they could, Cupid himselfe would blush
6 1174 To see me thus transformed to a boy
6 1175 
6 1176    Lor. Descend, for you must be my torch-bearer
6 1177 
6 1178    Ies. What, must I hold a Candle to my shames?
6 1179 They in themselues goodsooth are too too light.
6 1180 Why, 'tis an office of discouery Loue,
6 1181 And I should be obscur'd
6 1182 
6 1183    Lor. So you are sweet,
6 1184 Euen in the louely garnish of a boy: but come at once,
6 1185 For the close night doth play the run-away,
6 1186 And we are staid for at Bassanio's feast
6 1187 
6 1188    Ies. I will make fast the doores and guild my selfe
6 1189 With some more ducats, and be with you straight
6 1190 
6 1191    Gra. Now by my hood, a gentle, and no Iew
6 1192 
6 1193    Lor. Beshrew me but I loue her heartily.
6 1194 For she is wise, if I can iudge of her.
6 1195 And faire she is, if that mine eyes be true,
6 1196 And true she is, as she hath prou'd her selfe:
6 1197 And therefore like her selfe, wise, faire, and true,
6 1198 Shall she be placed in my constant soule.
6 1199 Enter Iessica.
6 1200 
6 1201 What, art thou come? on gentlemen, away,
6 1202 Our masking mates by this time for vs stay.
6 1203 Enter.
6 1204 
6 1205 Enter Anthonio.
6 1206 
6 1207   Ant. Who's there?
6 1208   Gra. Signior Anthonio?
6 1209   Ant. Fie, fie, Gratiano, where are all the rest?
6 1210 'Tis nine a clocke, our friends all stay for you,
6 1211 No maske to night, the winde is come about,
6 1212 Bassanio presently will goe aboord,
6 1213 I haue sent twenty out to seeke for you
6 1214 
6 1215    Gra. I am glad on't, I desire no more delight
6 1216 Then to be vnder saile, and gone to night.
6 1217 
6 1218 Exeunt.
6 1219 
6 1220 Enter Portia with Morrocho, and both their traines.
6 1221 
6 1222   Por. Goe, draw aside the curtaines, and discouer
6 1223 The seuerall Caskets to this noble Prince:
6 1224 Now make your choyse
6 1225 
6 1226    Mor. The first of gold, who this inscription beares,
6 1227 Who chooseth me, shall gaine what men desire.
6 1228 The second siluer, which this promise carries,
6 1229 Who chooseth me, shall get as much as he deserues.
6 1230 This third, dull lead, with warning all as blunt,
6 1231 Who chooseth me, must giue and hazard all he hath.
6 1232 How shall I know if I doe choose the right?
6 1233 How shall I know if I doe choose the right
6 1234 
6 1235    Por. The one of them containes my picture Prince,
6 1236 If you choose that, then I am yours withall
6 1237 
6 1238    Mor. Some God direct my iudgement, let me see,
6 1239 I will suruay the inscriptions, backe againe:
6 1240 What saies this leaden casket?
6 1241 Who chooseth me, must giue and hazard all he hath.
6 1242 Must giue, for what? for lead, hazard for lead?
6 1243 This casket threatens men that hazard all
6 1244 Doe it in hope of faire aduantages:
6 1245 A golden minde stoopes not to showes of drosse,
6 1246 Ile then nor giue nor hazard ought for lead.
6 1247 What saies the Siluer with her virgin hue?
6 1248 Who chooseth me, shall get as much as he deserues.
6 1249 As much as he deserues; pause there Morocho,
6 1250 And weigh thy value with an euen hand,
6 1251 If thou beest rated by thy estimation
6 1252 Thou doost deserue enough, and yet enough
6 1253 May not extend so farre as to the Ladie:
6 1254 And yet to be afeard of my deseruing,
6 1255 Were but a weake disabling of my selfe.
6 1256 As much as I deserue, why that's the Lady.
6 1257 I doe in birth deserue her, and in fortunes,
6 1258 In graces, and in qualities of breeding:
6 1259 But more then these, in loue I doe deserue.
6 1260 What if I strai'd no farther, but chose here?
6 1261 Let's see once more this saying grau'd in gold.
6 1262 Who chooseth me shall gaine what many men desire:
6 1263 Why that's the Lady, all the world desires her:
6 1264 From the foure corners of the earth they come
6 1265 To kisse this shrine, this mortall breathing Saint.
6 1266 The Hircanion deserts, and the vaste wildes
6 1267 Of wide Arabia are as throughfares now
6 1268 For Princes to come view faire Portia.
6 1269 The waterie Kingdome, whose ambitious head
6 1270 Spets in the face of heauen, is no barre
6 1271 To stop the forraine spirits, but they come
6 1272 As ore a brooke to see faire Portia.
6 1273 One of these three containes her heauenly picture.
6 1274 Is't like that Lead containes her? 'twere damnation
6 1275 To thinke so base a thought, it were too grose
6 1276 To rib her searecloath in the obscure graue:
6 1277 Or shall I thinke in Siluer she's immur'd
6 1278 Being ten times vndervalued to tride gold;
6 1279 O sinfull thought, neuer so rich a Iem
6 1280 Was set in worse then gold! They haue in England
6 1281 A coyne that beares the figure of an Angell
6 1282 Stampt in gold, but that's insculpt vpon:
6 1283 But here an Angell in a golden bed
6 1284 Lies all within. Deliuer me the key:
6 1285 Here doe I choose, and thriue I as I may
6 1286 
6 1287    Por. There take it Prince, and if my forme lye there
6 1288 Then I am yours
6 1289 
6 1290    Mor. O hell! what haue we here, a carrion death,
6 1291 Within whose emptie eye there is a written scroule;
6 1292 Ile reade the writing.
6 1293 All that glisters is not gold,
6 1294 Often haue you heard that told;
6 1295 Many a man his life hath sold
6 1296 But my outside to behold;
6 1297 Guilded timber doe wormes infold:
6 1298 Had you beene as wise as bold,
6 1299 Yong in limbs, in iudgement old,
6 1300 Your answere had not beene inscrold,
6 1301 Fareyouwell, your suite is cold,
6 1302   Mor. Cold indeede, and labour lost,
6 1303 Then farewell heate, and welcome frost:
6 1304 Portia adew, I haue too grieu'd a heart
6 1305 To take a tedious leaue: thus loosers part.
6 1306 Enter.
6 1307 
6 1308   Por. A gentle riddance: draw the curtaines, go:
6 1309 Let all of his complexion choose me so.
6 1310 
6 1311 Exeunt.
6 1312 
6 1313 Enter Salarino and Solanio.
6 1314 
6 1315   Flo. Cornets
6 1316 
6 1317    Sal. Why man I saw Bassanio vnder sayle;
6 1318 With him is Gratiano gone along;
6 1319 And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not
6 1320 
6 1321    Sol. The villaine Iew with outcries raisd the Duke.
6 1322 Who went with him to search Bassanios ship
6 1323 
6 1324    Sal. He comes too late, the ship was vndersaile;
6 1325 But there the Duke was giuen to vnderstand
6 1326 That in a Gondilo were seene together
6 1327 Lorenzo and his amorous Iessica.
6 1328 Besides, Anthonio certified the Duke
6 1329 They were not with Bassanio in his ship
6 1330 
6 1331    Sol. I neuer heard a passion so confusd,
6 1332 So strange, outragious, and so variable,
6 1333 As the dogge Iew did vtter in the streets;
6 1334 My daughter, O my ducats, O my daughter,
6 1335 Fled with a Christian, O my Christian ducats!
6 1336 Iustice, the law, my ducats, and my daughter;
6 1337 A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,
6 1338 Of double ducats, stolne from me by my daughter,
6 1339 And iewels, two stones, two rich and precious stones,
6 1340 Stolne by my daughter: iustice, finde the girle,
6 1341 She hath the stones vpon her, and the ducats
6 1342 
6 1343    Sal. Why all the boyes in Venice follow him,
6 1344 Crying his stones, his daughter, and his ducats
6 1345 
6 1346    Sol. Let good Anthonio looke he keepe his day
6 1347 Or he shall pay for this
6 1348 
6 1349    Sal. Marry well remembred,
6 1350 I reason'd with a Frenchman yesterday,
6 1351 Who told me, in the narrow seas that part
6 1352 The French and English, there miscaried
6 1353 A vessell of our countrey richly fraught:
6 1354 I thought vpon Anthonio when he told me,
6 1355 And wisht in silence that it were not his
6 1356 
6 1357    Sol. You were best to tell Anthonio what you heare.
6 1358 Yet doe not suddainely, for it may grieue him
6 1359 
6 1360    Sal. A kinder Gentleman treads not the earth,
6 1361 I saw Bassanio and Anthonio part,
6 1362 Bassanio told him he would make some speede
6 1363 Of his returne: he answered, doe not so,
6 1364 Slubber not businesse for my sake Bassanio,
6 1365 But stay the very riping of the time,
6 1366 And for the Iewes bond which he hath of me,
6 1367 Let it not enter in your minde of loue:
6 1368 Be merry, and imploy your chiefest thoughts
6 1369 To courtship, and such faire ostents of loue
6 1370 As shall conueniently become you there;
6 1371 And euen there his eye being big with teares,
6 1372 Turning his face, he put his hand behinde him,
6 1373 And with affection wondrous sencible
6 1374 He wrung Bassanios hand, and so they parted
6 1375 
6 1376    Sol. I thinke he onely loues the world for him,
6 1377 I pray thee let vs goe and finde him out
6 1378 And quicken his embraced heauinesse
6 1379 With some delight or other
6 1380 
6 1381    Sal. Doe we so.
6 1382 
6 1383 Exeunt.
6 1384 
6 1385 Enter Nerrissa and a Seruiture.
6 1386 
6 1387   Ner. Quick, quick I pray thee, draw the curtain strait,
6 1388 The Prince of Arragon hath tane his oath,
6 1389 And comes to his election presently.
6 1390 Enter Arragon, his traine, and Portia. Flor. Cornets.
6 1391 
6 1392   Por. Behold, there stand the caskets noble Prince,
6 1393 If you choose that wherein I am contain'd,
6 1394 Straight shall our nuptiall rights be solemniz'd:
6 1395 But if thou faile, without more speech my Lord,
6 1396 You must be gone from hence immediately
6 1397 
6 1398    Ar. I am enioynd by oath to obserue three things;
6 1399 First, neuer to vnfold to any one
6 1400 Which casket 'twas I chose; next, if I faile
6 1401 Of the right casket, neuer in my life
6 1402 To wooe a maide in way of marriage:
6 1403 Lastly, if I doe faile in fortune of my choyse,
6 1404 Immediately to leaue you, and be gone
6 1405 
6 1406    Por. To these iniunctions euery one doth sweare
6 1407 That comes to hazard for my worthlesse selfe
6 1408 
6 1409    Ar. And so haue I addrest me, fortune now
6 1410 To my hearts hope: gold, siluer, and base lead.
6 1411 Who chooseth me must giue and hazard all he hath.
6 1412 You shall looke fairer ere I giue or hazard.
6 1413 What saies the golden chest, ha, let me see.
6 1414 Who chooseth me, shall gaine what many men desire:
6 1415 What many men desire, that many may be meant
6 1416 By the foole multitude that choose by show,
6 1417 Not learning more then the fond eye doth teach,
6 1418 Which pries not to th' interior, but like the Martlet
6 1419 Builds in the weather on the outward wall,
6 1420 Euen in the force and rode of casualtie.
6 1421 I will not choose what many men desire,
6 1422 Because I will not iumpe with common spirits,
6 1423 And ranke me with the barbarous multitudes.
6 1424 Why then to thee thou Siluer treasure house,
6 1425 Tell me once more, what title thou doost beare;
6 1426 Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserues:
6 1427 And well said too; for who shall goe about
6 1428 To cosen Fortune, and be honourable
6 1429 Without the stampe of merrit, let none presume
6 1430 To weare an vndeserued dignitie:
6 1431 O that estates, degrees, and offices,
6 1432 Were not deriu'd corruptly, and that cleare honour
6 1433 Were purchast by the merrit of the wearer;
6 1434 How many then should couer that stand bare?
6 1435 How many be commanded that command?
6 1436 How much low pleasantry would then be gleaned
6 1437 From the true seede of honor? And how much honor
6 1438 Pickt from the chaffe and ruine of the times,
6 1439 To be new varnisht: Well, but to my choise.
6 1440 Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserues.
6 1441 I will assume desert; giue me a key for this,
6 1442 And instantly vnlocke my fortunes here
6 1443 
6 1444    Por. Too long a pause for that which you finde there
6 1445 
6 1446    Ar. What's here, the portrait of a blinking idiot
6 1447 Presenting me a scedule, I will reade it:
6 1448 How much vnlike art thou to Portia?
6 1449 How much vnlike my hopes and my deseruings?
6 1450 Who chooseth me, shall haue as much as he deserues.
6 1451 Did I deserue no more then a fooles head,
6 1452 Is that my prize, are my deserts no better?
6 1453   Por. To offend and iudge are distinct offices,
6 1454 And of opposed natures
6 1455 
6 1456    Ar. What is here?
6 1457 The fier seauen times tried this,
6 1458 Seauen times tried that iudgement is,
6 1459 That did neuer choose amis,
6 1460 Some there be that shadowes kisse,
6 1461 Such haue but a shadowes blisse:
6 1462 There be fooles aliue Iwis
6 1463 Siluer'd o're, and so was this:
6 1464 Take what wife you will to bed,
6 1465 I will euer be your head:
6 1466 So be gone, you are sped
6 1467 
6 1468    Ar. Still more foole I shall appeare
6 1469 By the time I linger here,
6 1470 With one fooles head I came to woo,
6 1471 But I goe away with two.
6 1472 Sweet adue, Ile keepe my oath,
6 1473 Patiently to beare my wroath
6 1474 
6 1475    Por. Thus hath the candle sing'd the moath:
6 1476 O these deliberate fooles when they doe choose,
6 1477 They haue the wisdome by their wit to loose
6 1478 
6 1479    Ner. The ancient saying is no heresie,
6 1480 Hanging and wiuing goes by destinie
6 1481 
6 1482    Por. Come draw the curtaine Nerrissa.
6 1483 Enter Messenger.
6 1484 
6 1485   Mes. Where is my Lady?
6 1486   Por. Here, what would my Lord?
6 1487   Mes. Madam, there is a-lighted at your gate
6 1488 A yong Venetian, one that comes before
6 1489 To signifie th' approaching of his Lord,
6 1490 From whom he bringeth sensible regreets;
6 1491 To wit (besides commends and curteous breath)
6 1492 Gifts of rich value; yet I haue not seene
6 1493 So likely an Embassador of loue.
6 1494 A day in Aprill neuer came so sweete
6 1495 To show how costly Sommer was at hand,
6 1496 As this fore-spurrer comes before his Lord
6 1497 
6 1498    Por. No more I pray thee, I am halfe a-feard
6 1499 Thou wilt say anone he is some kin to thee,
6 1500 Thou spend'st such high-day wit in praising him:
6 1501 Come, come Nerryssa, for I long to see
6 1502 Quicke Cupids Post, that comes so mannerly
6 1503 
6 1504    Ner. Bassanio Lord, loue if thy will it be.
6 1505 
6 1506 Exeunt.
6 1507 
6 1508 
6 1509 Actus Tertius.
6 1510 
6 1511 Enter Solanio and Salarino.
6 1512 
6 1513   Sol. Now, what newes on the Ryalto?
6 1514   Sal. Why yet it liues there vncheckt, that Anthonio
6 1515 hath a ship of rich lading wrackt on the narrow Seas; the
6 1516 Goodwins I thinke they call the place, a very dangerous
6 1517 flat, and fatall, where the carcasses of many a tall ship, lye
6 1518 buried, as they say, if my gossips report be an honest woman
6 1519 of her word
6 1520 
6 1521    Sol. I would she were as lying a gossip in that, as euer
6 1522 knapt Ginger, or made her neighbours beleeue she wept
6 1523 for the death of a third husband: but it is true, without
6 1524 any slips of prolixity, or crossing the plaine high-way of
6 1525 talke, that the good Anthonio, the honest Anthonio; o that
6 1526 I had a title good enough to keepe his name company!
6 1527   Sal. Come, the full stop
6 1528 
6 1529    Sol. Ha, what sayest thou, why the end is, he hath lost
6 1530 a ship
6 1531 
6 1532    Sal. I would it might proue the end of his losses
6 1533 
6 1534    Sol. Let me say Amen betimes, least the diuell crosse
6 1535 my praier, for here he comes in the likenes of a Iew. How
6 1536 now Shylocke, what newes among the Merchants?
6 1537 Enter Shylocke.
6 1538 
6 1539   Shy. You knew none so well, none so well as you, of
6 1540 my daughters flight
6 1541 
6 1542    Sal. That's certaine, I for my part knew the Tailor
6 1543 that made the wings she flew withall
6 1544 
6 1545    Sol. And Shylocke for his owne part knew the bird was
6 1546 fledg'd, and then it is the complexion of them al to leaue
6 1547 the dam
6 1548 
6 1549    Shy. She is damn'd for it
6 1550 
6 1551    Sal. That's certaine, if the diuell may be her Iudge
6 1552 
6 1553    Shy. My owne flesh and blood to rebell
6 1554 
6 1555    Sol. Out vpon it old carrion, rebels it at these yeeres
6 1556 
6 1557    Shy. I say my daughter is my flesh and bloud
6 1558 
6 1559    Sal. There is more difference betweene thy flesh and
6 1560 hers, then betweene Iet and Iuorie, more betweene your
6 1561 bloods, then there is betweene red wine and rennish: but
6 1562 tell vs, doe you heare whether Anthonio haue had anie
6 1563 losse at sea or no?
6 1564   Shy. There I haue another bad match, a bankrout, a
6 1565 prodigall, who dare scarce shew his head on the Ryalto,
6 1566 a begger that was vsd to come so smug vpon the Mart:
6 1567 let him look to his bond, he was wont to call me Vsurer,
6 1568 let him looke to his bond, he was wont to lend money
6 1569 for a Christian curtsie, let him looke to his bond
6 1570 
6 1571    Sal. Why I am sure if he forfaite, thou wilt not take
6 1572 his flesh, what's that good for?
6 1573   Shy. To baite fish withall, if it will feede nothing
6 1574 else, it will feede my reuenge; he hath disgrac'd me, and
6 1575 hindred me halfe a million, laught at my losses, mockt at
6 1576 my gaines, scorned my Nation, thwarted my bargaines,
6 1577 cooled my friends, heated mine enemies, and what's the
6 1578 reason? I am a Iewe: Hath not a Iew eyes? hath not a
6 1579 Iew hands, organs, dementions, sences, affections, passions,
6 1580 fed with the same foode, hurt with the same weapons,
6 1581 subiect to the same diseases, healed by the same
6 1582 meanes, warmed and cooled by the same Winter and
6 1583 Sommer as a Christian is: if you pricke vs doe we not
6 1584 bleede? if you tickle vs, doe we not laugh? if you poison
6 1585 vs doe we not die? and if you wrong vs shall we not reuenge?
6 1586 if we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you
6 1587 in that. If a Iew wrong a Christian, what is his humility,
6 1588 reuenge? If a Christian wrong a Iew, what should his sufferance
6 1589 be by Christian example, why reuenge? The villanie
6 1590 you teach me I will execute, and it shall goe hard
6 1591 but I will better the instruction.
6 1592 Enter a man from Anthonio.
6 1593 
6 1594 Gentlemen, my maister Anthonio is at his house, and
6 1595 desires to speake with you both
6 1596 
6 1597    Sal. We haue beene vp and downe to seeke him.
6 1598 Enter Tuball.
6 1599 
6 1600   Sol. Here comes another of the Tribe, a third cannot
6 1601 be matcht, vnlesse the diuell himselfe turne Iew.
6 1602 
6 1603 Exeunt. Gentlemen
6 1604 
6 1605    Shy. How now Tuball, what newes from Genowa? hast
6 1606 thou found my daughter?
6 1607   Tub. I often came where I did heare of her, but cannot
6 1608 finde her
6 1609 
6 1610    Shy. Why there, there, there, there, a diamond gone
6 1611 cost me two thousand ducats in Franckford, the curse neuer
6 1612 fell vpon our Nation till now, I neuer felt it till now,
6 1613 two thousand ducats in that, and other precious, precious
6 1614 iewels: I would my daughter were dead at my foot,
6 1615 and the iewels in her eare: would she were hearst at my
6 1616 foote, and the duckets in her coffin: no newes of them,
6 1617 why so? and I know not how much is spent in the search:
6 1618 why thou losse vpon losse, the theefe gone with so
6 1619 much, and so much to finde the theefe, and no satisfaction,
6 1620 no reuenge, nor no ill luck stirring but what lights
6 1621 a my shoulders, no sighes but a my breathing, no teares
6 1622 but a my shedding
6 1623 
6 1624    Tub. Yes, other men haue ill lucke too, Anthonio as I
6 1625 heard in Genowa?
6 1626   Shy. What, what, what, ill lucke, ill lucke
6 1627 
6 1628    Tub. Hath an Argosie cast away comming from Tripolis
6 1629 
6 1630    Shy. I thanke God, I thanke God, is it true, is it true?
6 1631   Tub. I spoke with some of the Saylers that escaped
6 1632 the wracke
6 1633 
6 1634    Shy. I thanke thee good Tuball, good newes, good
6 1635 newes: ha, ha, here in Genowa
6 1636 
6 1637    Tub. Your daughter spent in Genowa, as I heard, one
6 1638 night fourescore ducats
6 1639 
6 1640    Shy. Thou stick'st a dagger in me, I shall neuer see my
6 1641 gold againe, fourescore ducats at a sitting, fourescore ducats
6 1642 
6 1643    Tub. There came diuers of Anthonios creditors in my
6 1644 company to Venice, that sweare hee cannot choose but
6 1645 breake
6 1646 
6 1647    Shy. I am very glad of it, ile plague him, ile torture
6 1648 him, I am glad of it,
6 1649   Tub. One of them shewed me a ring that hee had of
6 1650 your daughter for a Monkie
6 1651 
6 1652    Shy. Out vpon her, thou torturest me Tuball, it was
6 1653 my Turkies, I had it of Leah when I was a Batcheler: I
6 1654 would not haue giuen it for a wildernesse of Monkies
6 1655 
6 1656    Tub. But Anthonio is certainely vndone
6 1657 
6 1658    Shy. Nay, that's true, that's very true, goe Tuball, see
6 1659 me an Officer, bespeake him a fortnight before, I will
6 1660 haue the heart of him if he forfeit, for were he out of Venice,
6 1661 I can make what merchandize I will: goe Tuball,
6 1662 and meete me at our Sinagogue, goe good Tuball, at our
6 1663 Sinagogue Tuball.
6 1664 
6 1665 Exeunt.
6 1666 
6 1667 Enter Bassanio, Portia, Gratiano, and all their traine.
6 1668 
6 1669   Por. I pray you tarrie, pause a day or two
6 1670 Before you hazard, for in choosing wrong
6 1671 I loose your companie; therefore forbeare a while,
6 1672 There's something tels me (but it is not loue)
6 1673 I would not loose you, and you know your selfe,
6 1674 Hate counsailes not in such a quallitie;
6 1675 But least you should not vnderstand me well,
6 1676 And yet a maiden hath no tongue, but thought,
6 1677 I would detaine you here some month or two
6 1678 Before you venture for me. I could teach you
6 1679 How to choose right, but then I am forsworne,
6 1680 So will I neuer be, so may you misse me,
6 1681 But if you doe, youle make me wish a sinne,
6 1682 That I had beene forsworne: Beshrow your eyes,
6 1683 They haue ore-lookt me and deuided me,
6 1684 One halfe of me is yours, the other halfe yours,
6 1685 Mine owne I would say: but of mine then yours,
6 1686 And so all yours; O these naughtie times
6 1687 Puts bars betweene the owners and their rights.
6 1688 And so though yours, not yours (proue it so)
6 1689 Let Fortune goe to hell for it, not I.
6 1690 I speake too long, but 'tis to peize the time,
6 1691 To ich it, and to draw it out in length,
6 1692 To stay you from election
6 1693 
6 1694    Bass. Let me choose,
6 1695 For as I am, I liue vpon the racke
6 1696 
6 1697    Por. Vpon the racke Bassanio, then confesse
6 1698 What treason there is mingled with your loue
6 1699 
6 1700    Bass. None but that vglie treason of mistrust.
6 1701 Which makes me feare the enioying of my loue:
6 1702 There may as well be amitie and life,
6 1703 'Tweene snow and fire, as treason and my loue
6 1704 
6 1705    Por. I, but I feare you speake vpon the racke,
6 1706 Where men enforced doth speake any thing
6 1707 
6 1708    Bass. Promise me life, and ile confesse the truth
6 1709 
6 1710    Por. Well then, confesse and liue
6 1711 
6 1712    Bass. Confesse and loue
6 1713 Had beene the verie sum of my confession:
6 1714 O happie torment, when my torturer
6 1715 Doth teach me answers for deliuerance:
6 1716 But let me to my fortune and the caskets
6 1717 
6 1718    Por. Away then, I am lockt in one of them,
6 1719 If you doe loue me, you will finde me out.
6 1720 Nerryssa and the rest, stand all aloofe,
6 1721 Let musicke sound while he doth make his choise,
6 1722 Then if he loose he makes a Swan-like end,
6 1723 Fading in musique. That the comparison
6 1724 May stand more proper, my eye shall be the streame
6 1725 And watrie death-bed for him: he may win,
6 1726 And what is musique than? Than musique is
6 1727 Euen as the flourish, when true subiects bowe
6 1728 To a new crowned Monarch: Such it is,
6 1729 As are those dulcet sounds in breake of day,
6 1730 That creepe into the dreaming bride-groomes eare,
6 1731 And summon him to marriage. Now he goes
6 1732 With no lesse presence, but with much more loue
6 1733 Then yong Alcides, when he did redeeme
6 1734 The virgine tribute, paied by howling Troy
6 1735 To the Sea-monster: I stand for sacrifice,
6 1736 The rest aloofe are the Dardanian wiues:
6 1737 With bleared visages come forth to view
6 1738 The issue of th' exploit: Goe Hercules,
6 1739 Liue thou, I liue with much more dismay
6 1740 I view the sight, then thou that mak'st the fray.
6 1741 
6 1742 Here Musicke. A Song the whilst Bassanio comments on the
6 1743 Caskets to
6 1744 himselfe.
6 1745 
6 1746 Tell me where is fancie bred,
6 1747 Or in the heart, or in the head:
6 1748 How begot, how nourished. Replie, replie.
6 1749 It is engendred in the eyes,
6 1750 With gazing fed, and Fancie dies,
6 1751 In the cradle where it lies:
6 1752 Let vs all ring Fancies knell.
6 1753 Ile begin it.
6 1754 Ding, dong, bell
6 1755 
6 1756    All. Ding, dong, bell
6 1757 
6 1758    Bass. So may the outward showes be least themselues
6 1759 The world is still deceiu'd with ornament.
6 1760 In Law, what Plea so tainted and corrupt,
6 1761 But being season'd with a gracious voice,
6 1762 Obscures the show of euill? In Religion,
6 1763 What damned error, but some sober brow
6 1764 Will blesse it, and approue it with a text,
6 1765 Hiding the grosenesse with faire ornament:
6 1766 There is no voice so simple, but assumes
6 1767 Some marke of vertue on his outward parts;
6 1768 How manie cowards, whose hearts are all as false
6 1769 As stayers of sand, weare yet vpon their chins
6 1770 The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars,
6 1771 Who inward searcht, haue lyuers white as milke,
6 1772 And these assume but valors excrement,
6 1773 To render them redoubted. Looke on beautie,
6 1774 And you shall see 'tis purchast by the weight,
6 1775 Which therein workes a miracle in nature,
6 1776 Making them lightest that weare most of it:
6 1777 So are those crisped snakie golden locks
6 1778 Which makes such wanton gambols with the winde
6 1779 Vpon supposed fairenesse, often knowne
6 1780 To be the dowrie of a second head,
6 1781 The scull that bred them in the Sepulcher.
6 1782 Thus ornament is but the guiled shore
6 1783 To a most dangerous sea: the beautious scarfe
6 1784 Vailing an Indian beautie; In a word,
6 1785 The seeming truth which cunning times put on
6 1786 To intrap the wisest. Therefore then thou gaudie gold,
6 1787 Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee,
6 1788 Nor none of thee thou pale and common drudge
6 1789 'Tweene man and man: but thou, thou meager lead
6 1790 Which rather threatnest then dost promise ought,
6 1791 Thy palenesse moues me more then eloquence,
6 1792 And here choose I, ioy be the consequence
6 1793 
6 1794    Por. How all the other passions fleet to ayre,
6 1795 As doubtfull thoughts, and rash imbrac'd despaire:
6 1796 And shuddring feare, and greene-eyed iealousie.
6 1797 O loue be moderate, allay thy extasie,
6 1798 In measure raine thy ioy, scant this excesse,
6 1799 I feele too much thy blessing, make it lesse,
6 1800 For feare I surfeit
6 1801 
6 1802    Bas. What finde I here?
6 1803 Faire Portias counterfeit. What demie God
6 1804 Hath come so neere creation? moue these eies?
6 1805 Or whether riding on the bals of mine
6 1806 Seeme they in motion? Here are seuer'd lips
6 1807 Parted with suger breath, so sweet a barre
6 1808 Should sunder such sweet friends: here in her haires
6 1809 The Painter plaies the Spider, and hath wouen
6 1810 A golden mesh t' intrap the hearts of men
6 1811 Faster then gnats in cobwebs: but her eies,
6 1812 How could he see to doe them? hauing made one,
6 1813 Me thinkes it should haue power to steale both his
6 1814 And leaue it selfe vnfurnisht: Yet looke how farre
6 1815 The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow
6 1816 In vnderprising it, so farre this shadow
6 1817 Doth limpe behinde the substance. Here's the scroule,
6 1818 The continent, and summarie of my fortune.
6 1819 You that choose not by the view
6 1820 Chance as faire, and choose as true:
6 1821 Since this fortune fals to you,
6 1822 Be content, and seeke no new.
6 1823 If you be well pleasd with this,
6 1824 And hold your fortune for your blisse,
6 1825 Turne you where your Lady is,
6 1826 And claime her with a louing kisse
6 1827 
6 1828    Bass. A gentle scroule: Faire Lady, by your leaue,
6 1829 I come by note to giue, and to receiue,
6 1830 Like one of two contending in a prize
6 1831 That thinks he hath done well in peoples eies:
6 1832 Hearing applause and vniuersall shout,
6 1833 Giddie in spirit, still gazing in a doubt
6 1834 Whether those peales of praise be his or no.
6 1835 So thrice faire Lady stand I euen so,
6 1836 As doubtfull whether what I see be true,
6 1837 Vntill confirm'd, sign'd, ratified by you
6 1838 
6 1839    Por. You see my Lord Bassiano where I stand,
6 1840 Such as I am; though for my selfe alone
6 1841 I would not be ambitious in my wish,
6 1842 To wish my selfe much better, yet for you,
6 1843 I would be trebled twenty times my selfe,
6 1844 A thousand times more faire, ten thousand times
6 1845 More rich, that onely to stand high in your account,
6 1846 I might in vertues, beauties, liuings, friends,
6 1847 Exceed account: but the full summe of me
6 1848 Is sum of nothing: which to terme in grosse,
6 1849 Is an vnlessoned girle, vnschool'd, vnpractiz'd,
6 1850 Happy in this, she is not yet so old
6 1851 But she may learne: happier then this,
6 1852 Shee is not bred so dull but she can learne;
6 1853 Happiest of all, is that her gentle spirit
6 1854 Commits it selfe to yours to be directed,
6 1855 As from her Lord, her Gouernour, her King.
6 1856 My selfe, and what is mine, to you and yours
6 1857 Is now conuerted. But now I was the Lord
6 1858 Of this faire mansion, master of my seruants,
6 1859 Queene ore my selfe: and euen now, but now,
6 1860 This house, these seruants, and this same my selfe
6 1861 Are yours, my Lord, I giue them with this ring,
6 1862 Which when you part from, loose, or giue away,
6 1863 Let it presage the ruine of your loue,
6 1864 And be my vantage to exclaime on you
6 1865 
6 1866    Bass. Maddam, you haue bereft me of all words,
6 1867 Onely my bloud speakes to you in my vaines,
6 1868 And there is such confusion in my powers,
6 1869 As after some oration fairely spoke
6 1870 By a beloued Prince, there doth appeare
6 1871 Among the buzzing pleased multitude,
6 1872 Where euery something being blent together,
6 1873 Turnes to a wilde of nothing, saue of ioy
6 1874 Exprest, and not exprest: but when this ring
6 1875 Parts from this finger, then parts life from hence,
6 1876 O then be bold to say Bassanio's dead
6 1877 
6 1878    Ner. My Lord and Lady, it is now our time
6 1879 That haue stood by and seene our wishes prosper,
6 1880 To cry good ioy, good ioy my Lord and Lady
6 1881 
6 1882    Gra. My Lord Bassanio, and my gentle Lady,
6 1883 I wish you all the ioy that you can wish:
6 1884 For I am sure you can wish none from me:
6 1885 And when your Honours meane to solemnize
6 1886 The bargaine of your faith: I doe beseech you
6 1887 Euen at that time I may be married too
6 1888 
6 1889    Bass. With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife
6 1890 
6 1891    Gra. I thanke your Lordship, you haue got me one.
6 1892 My eyes my Lord can looke as swift as yours:
6 1893 You saw the mistres, I beheld the maid:
6 1894 You lou'd, I lou'd for intermission,
6 1895 No more pertaines to me my Lord then you;
6 1896 Your fortune stood vpon the caskets there,
6 1897 And so did mine too, as the matter falls:
6 1898 For wooing heere vntill I swet againe,
6 1899 And swearing till my very rough was dry
6 1900 With oathes of loue, at last, if promise last,
6 1901 I got a promise of this faire one heere
6 1902 To haue her loue: prouided that your fortune
6 1903 Atchieu'd her mistresse
6 1904 
6 1905    Por. Is this true Nerrissa?
6 1906   Ner. Madam it is so, so you stand pleas'd withall
6 1907 
6 1908    Bass. And doe you Gratiano meane good faith?
6 1909   Gra. Yes faith my Lord
6 1910 
6 1911    Bass. Our feast shall be much honored in your marriage
6 1912 
6 1913    Gra. Weele play with them the first boy for a thousand
6 1914 ducats
6 1915 
6 1916    Ner. What and stake downe?
6 1917   Gra. No, we shal nere win at that sport, and stake
6 1918 downe.
6 1919 But who comes heere? Lorenzo and his Infidell?
6 1920 What and my old Venetian friend Salerio?
6 1921 Enter Lorenzo, Iessica, and Salerio.
6 1922 
6 1923   Bas. Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hether,
6 1924 If that the youth of my new interest heere
6 1925 Haue power to bid you welcome: by your leaue
6 1926 I bid my verie friends and Countrimen
6 1927 Sweet Portia welcome
6 1928 
6 1929    Por. So do I my Lord, they are intirely welcome
6 1930 
6 1931    Lor. I thanke your honor; for my part my Lord,
6 1932 My purpose was not to haue seene you heere,
6 1933 But meeting with Salerio by the way,
6 1934 He did intreate mee past all saying nay
6 1935 To come with him along
6 1936 
6 1937    Sal. I did my Lord,
6 1938 And I haue reason for it, Signior Anthonio
6 1939 Commends him to you
6 1940 
6 1941    Bass. Ere I ope his Letter
6 1942 I pray you tell me how my good friend doth
6 1943 
6 1944    Sal. Not sicke my Lord, vnlesse it be in minde,
6 1945 Nor wel, vnlesse in minde: his Letter there
6 1946 Wil shew you his estate.
6 1947 
6 1948 Opens the Letter.
6 1949 
6 1950   Gra. Nerrissa, cheere yond stranger, bid her welcom.
6 1951 Your hand Salerio, what's the newes from Venice?
6 1952 How doth that royal Merchant good Anthonio;
6 1953 I know he will be glad of our successe,
6 1954 We are the Iasons, we haue won the fleece
6 1955 
6 1956    Sal. I would you had won the fleece that hee hath
6 1957 lost
6 1958 
6 1959    Por. There are some shrewd contents in yond same
6 1960 Paper,
6 1961 That steales the colour from Bassianos cheeke,
6 1962 Some deere friend dead, else nothing in the world
6 1963 Could turne so much the constitution
6 1964 Of any constant man. What, worse and worse?
6 1965 With leaue Bassanio I am halfe your selfe,
6 1966 And I must freely haue the halfe of any thing
6 1967 That this same paper brings you
6 1968 
6 1969    Bass. O sweet Portia,
6 1970 Heere are a few of the vnpleasant'st words
6 1971 That euer blotted paper. Gentle Ladie
6 1972 When I did first impart my loue to you,
6 1973 I freely told you all the wealth I had
6 1974 Ran in my vaines: I was a Gentleman,
6 1975 And then I told you true: and yet deere Ladie,
6 1976 Rating my selfe at nothing, you shall see
6 1977 How much I was a Braggart, when I told you
6 1978 My state was nothing, I should then haue told you
6 1979 That I was worse then nothing: for indeede
6 1980 I haue ingag'd my selfe to a deere friend,
6 1981 Ingag'd my friend to his meere enemie
6 1982 To feede my meanes. Heere is a Letter Ladie,
6 1983 The paper as the bodie of my friend,
6 1984 And euerie word in it a gaping wound
6 1985 Issuing life blood. But is it true Salerio,
6 1986 Hath all his ventures faild, what not one hit,
6 1987 From Tripolis, from Mexico and England,
6 1988 From Lisbon, Barbary, and India,
6 1989 And not one vessell scape the dreadfull touch
6 1990 Of Merchant-marring rocks?
6 1991   Sal. Not one my Lord.
6 1992 Besides, it should appeare, that if he had
6 1993 The present money to discharge the Iew,
6 1994 He would not take it: neuer did I know
6 1995 A creature that did beare the shape of man
6 1996 So keene and greedy to confound a man.
6 1997 He plyes the Duke at morning and at night,
6 1998 And doth impeach the freedome of the state
6 1999 If they deny him iustice. Twenty Merchants,
6 2000 The Duke himselfe, and the Magnificoes
6 2001 Of greatest port haue all perswaded with him,
6 2002 But none can driue him from the enuious plea
6 2003 Of forfeiture, of iustice, and his bond
6 2004 
6 2005    Iessi. When I was with him, I haue heard him sweare
6 2006 To Tuball and to Chus, his Countri-men,
6 2007 That he would rather haue Anthonio's flesh,
6 2008 Then twenty times the value of the summe
6 2009 That he did owe him: and I know my Lord,
6 2010 If law, authoritie, and power denie not,
6 2011 It will goe hard with poore Anthonio
6 2012 
6 2013    Por. Is it your deere friend that is thus in trouble?
6 2014   Bass. The deerest friend to me, the kindest man,
6 2015 The best condition'd, and vnwearied spirit
6 2016 In doing curtesies: and one in whom
6 2017 The ancient Romane honour more appeares
6 2018 Then any that drawes breath in Italie
6 2019 
6 2020    Por. What summe owes he the Iew?
6 2021   Bass. For me three thousand ducats
6 2022 
6 2023    Por. What, no more?
6 2024 Pay him sixe thousand, and deface the bond:
6 2025 Double sixe thousand, and then treble that,
6 2026 Before a friend of this description
6 2027 Shall lose a haire through Bassanio's fault.
6 2028 First goe with me to Church, and call me wife,
6 2029 And then away to Venice to your friend:
6 2030 For neuer shall you lie by Portias side
6 2031 With an vnquiet soule. You shall haue gold
6 2032 To pay the petty debt twenty times ouer.
6 2033 When it is payd, bring your true friend along,
6 2034 My maid Nerrissa, and my selfe meane time
6 2035 Will liue as maids and widdowes; come away,
6 2036 For you shall hence vpon your wedding day:
6 2037 Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheere,
6 2038 Since you are deere bought, I will loue you deere.
6 2039 But let me heare the letter of your friend.
6 2040 Sweet Bassanio, my ships haue all miscarried, my Creditors
6 2041 grow cruell, my estate is very low, my bond to the Iew is
6 2042 forfeit, and since in paying it, it is impossible I should liue, all
6 2043 debts are cleerd between you and I, if I might see you at my
6 2044 death: notwithstanding, vse your pleasure, if your loue doe not
6 2045 perswade you to come, let not my letter
6 2046 
6 2047    Por. O loue! dispach all busines and be gone
6 2048 
6 2049    Bass. Since I haue your good leaue to goe away,
6 2050 I will make hast; but till I come againe,
6 2051 No bed shall ere be guilty of my stay,
6 2052 Nor rest be interposer twixt vs twaine.
6 2053 
6 2054 Exeunt.
6 2055 
6 2056 Enter the Iew, and Solanio, and Anthonio, and the Iaylor.
6 2057 
6 2058   Iew. Iaylor, looke to him, tell not me of mercy,
6 2059 This is the foole that lends out money gratis.
6 2060 Iaylor, looke to him
6 2061 
6 2062    Ant. Heare me yet good Shylok
6 2063 
6 2064    Iew. Ile haue my bond, speake not against my bond,
6 2065 I haue sworne an oath that I will haue my bond:
6 2066 Thou call'dst me dog before thou hadst a cause,
6 2067 But since I am a dog, beware my phangs,
6 2068 The Duke shall grant me iustice, I do wonder
6 2069 Thou naughty Iaylor, that thou art so fond
6 2070 To come abroad with him at his request
6 2071 
6 2072    Ant. I pray thee heare me speake
6 2073 
6 2074    Iew. Ile haue my bond, I will not heare thee speake,
6 2075 Ile haue my bond, and therefore speake no more,
6 2076 Ile not be made a soft and dull ey'd foole,
6 2077 To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yeeld
6 2078 To Christian intercessors: follow not,
6 2079 Ile haue no speaking, I will haue my bond.
6 2080 
6 2081 Exit Iew.
6 2082 
6 2083   Sol. It is the most impenetrable curre
6 2084 That euer kept with men
6 2085 
6 2086    Ant. Let him alone,
6 2087 Ile follow him no more with bootlesse prayers:
6 2088 He seekes my life, his reason well I know;
6 2089 I oft deliuer'd from his forfeitures
6 2090 Many that haue at times made mone to me,
6 2091 Therefore he hates me
6 2092 
6 2093    Sol. I am sure the Duke will neuer grant
6 2094 this forfeiture to hold
6 2095 
6 2096    An. The Duke cannot deny the course of law:
6 2097 For the commoditie that strangers haue
6 2098 With vs in Venice, if it be denied,
6 2099 Will much impeach the iustice of the State,
6 2100 Since that the trade and profit of the citty
6 2101 Consisteth of all Nations. Therefore goe,
6 2102 These greefes and losses haue so bated mee,
6 2103 That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh
6 2104 To morrow, to my bloudy Creditor.
6 2105 Well Iaylor, on, pray God Bassanio come
6 2106 To see me pay his debt, and then I care not.
6 2107 
6 2108 Exeunt.
6 2109 
6 2110 Enter Portia, Nerrissa, Lorenzo, Iessica, and a man of Portias.
6 2111 
6 2112   Lor. Madam, although I speake it in your presence,
6 2113 You haue a noble and a true conceit
6 2114 Of god-like amity, which appeares most strongly
6 2115 In bearing thus the absence of your Lord.
6 2116 But if you knew to whom you shew this honour,
6 2117 How true a Gentleman you send releefe,
6 2118 How deere a louer of my Lord your husband,
6 2119 I know you would be prouder of the worke
6 2120 Then customary bounty can enforce you
6 2121 
6 2122    Por. I neuer did repent for doing good,
6 2123 Nor shall not now: for in companions
6 2124 That do conuerse and waste the time together,
6 2125 Whose soules doe beare an egal yoke of loue.
6 2126 There must be needs a like proportion
6 2127 Of lyniaments, of manners, and of spirit;
6 2128 Which makes me thinke that this Anthonio
6 2129 Being the bosome louer of my Lord,
6 2130 Must needs be like my Lord. If it be so,
6 2131 How little is the cost I haue bestowed
6 2132 In purchasing the semblance of my soule;
6 2133 From out the state of hellish cruelty,
6 2134 This comes too neere the praising of my selfe,
6 2135 Therefore no more of it: heere other things
6 2136 Lorenso I commit into your hands,
6 2137 The husbandry and mannage of my house,
6 2138 Vntill my Lords returne; for mine owne part
6 2139 I haue toward heauen breath'd a secret vow,
6 2140 To liue in prayer and contemplation,
6 2141 Onely attended by Nerrissa heere,
6 2142 Vntill her husband and my Lords returne:
6 2143 There is a monastery too miles off,
6 2144 And there we will abide. I doe desire you
6 2145 Not to denie this imposition,
6 2146 The which my loue and some necessity
6 2147 Now layes vpon you
6 2148 
6 2149    Lorens. Madame, with all my heart,
6 2150 I shall obey you in all faire commands
6 2151 
6 2152    Por. My people doe already know my minde,
6 2153 And will acknowledge you and Iessica
6 2154 In place of Lord Bassanio and my selfe.
6 2155 So far you well till we shall meete againe
6 2156 
6 2157    Lor. Faire thoughts & happy houres attend on you
6 2158 
6 2159    Iessi. I wish your Ladiship all hearts content
6 2160 
6 2161    Por. I thanke you for your wish, and am well pleas'd
6 2162 To wish it backe on you: faryouwell Iessica.
6 2163 
6 2164 Exeunt.
6 2165 
6 2166 Now Balthaser, as I haue euer found thee honest true,
6 2167 So let me finde thee still: take this same letter,
6 2168 And vse thou all the indeauor of a man,
6 2169 In speed to Mantua, see thou render this
6 2170 Into my cosins hand, Doctor Belario,
6 2171 And looke what notes and garments he doth giue thee,
6 2172 Bring them I pray thee with imagin'd speed
6 2173 Vnto the Tranect, to the common Ferrie
6 2174 Which trades to Venice; waste no time in words,
6 2175 But get thee gone, I shall be there before thee
6 2176 
6 2177    Balth. Madam, I goe with all conuenient speed
6 2178 
6 2179    Por. Come on Nerissa, I haue worke in hand
6 2180 That you yet know not of; wee'll see our husbands
6 2181 Before they thinke of vs?
6 2182   Nerrissa. Shall they see vs?
6 2183   Portia. They shall Nerrissa: but in such a habit,
6 2184 That they shall thinke we are accomplished
6 2185 With that we lacke; Ile hold thee any wager
6 2186 When we are both accoutered like yong men,
6 2187 Ile proue the prettier fellow of the two,
6 2188 And weare my dagger with the brauer grace,
6 2189 And speake betweene the change of man and boy,
6 2190 With a reede voyce, and turne two minsing steps
6 2191 Into a manly stride; and speake of frayes
6 2192 Like a fine bragging youth: and tell quaint lyes
6 2193 How honourable Ladies sought my loue,
6 2194 Which I denying, they fell sicke and died.
6 2195 I could not doe withall: then Ile repent,
6 2196 And wish for all that, that I had not kil'd them;
6 2197 And twentie of these punie lies Ile tell,
6 2198 That men shall sweare I haue discontinued schoole
6 2199 Aboue a twelue moneth: I haue within my minde
6 2200 A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Iacks,
6 2201 Which I will practise
6 2202 
6 2203    Nerris. Why, shall wee turne to men?
6 2204   Portia. Fie, what a questions that?
6 2205 If thou wert nere a lewd interpreter:
6 2206 But come, Ile tell thee all my whole deuice
6 2207 When I am in my coach, which stayes for vs
6 2208 At the Parke gate; and therefore haste away,
6 2209 For we must measure twentie miles to day.
6 2210 
6 2211 Exeunt.
6 2212 
6 2213 Enter Clowne and Iessica.
6 2214 
6 2215   Clown. Yes truly; for looke you, the sinnes of the Father
6 2216 are to be laid vpon the children, therefore I promise
6 2217 you, I feare you, I was alwaies plaine with you, and so
6 2218 now I speake my agitation of the matter: therfore be of
6 2219 good cheere, for truly I thinke you are damn'd, there is
6 2220 but one hope in it that can doe you anie good, and that is
6 2221 but a kinde of bastard hope neither
6 2222 
6 2223    Iessica. And what hope is that I pray thee?
6 2224   Clow. Marrie you may partlie hope that your father
6 2225 got you not, that you are not the Iewes daughter
6 2226 
6 2227    Ies. That were a kinde of bastard hope indeed, so the
6 2228 sins of my mother should be visited vpon me
6 2229 
6 2230    Clow. Truly then I feare you are damned both by father
6 2231 and mother: thus when I shun Scilla your father, I
6 2232 fall into Charibdis your mother; well, you are gone both
6 2233 waies
6 2234 
6 2235    Ies. I shall be sau'd by my husband, he hath made me
6 2236 a Christian
6 2237 
6 2238    Clow. Truly the more to blame he, we were Christians
6 2239 enow before, e'ne as many as could wel liue one by another:
6 2240 this making of Christians will raise the price of
6 2241 Hogs, if wee grow all to be porke-eaters, wee shall not
6 2242 shortlie haue a rasher on the coales for money.
6 2243 Enter Lorenzo.
6 2244 
6 2245   Ies. Ile tell my husband Lancelet what you say, heere
6 2246 he comes
6 2247 
6 2248    Loren. I shall grow iealous of you shortly Lancelet,
6 2249 if you thus get my wife into corners?
6 2250   Ies. Nay, you need not feare vs Lorenzo, Launcelet
6 2251 and I are out, he tells me flatly there is no mercy for mee
6 2252 in heauen, because I am a Iewes daughter: and hee saies
6 2253 you are no good member of the common wealth, for
6 2254 in conuerting Iewes to Christians, you raise the price
6 2255 of Porke
6 2256 
6 2257    Loren. I shall answere that better to the Commonwealth,
6 2258 than you can the getting vp of the Negroes bellie:
6 2259 the Moore is with childe by you Launcelet?
6 2260   Clow. It is much that the Moore should be more then
6 2261 reason: but if she be lesse then an honest woman, shee is
6 2262 indeed more then I tooke her for
6 2263 
6 2264    Loren. How euerie foole can play vpon the word, I
6 2265 thinke the best grace of witte will shortly turne into silence,
6 2266 and discourse grow commendable in none onely
6 2267 but Parrats: goe in sirra, bid them prepare for dinner?
6 2268   Clow. That is done sir, they haue all stomacks?
6 2269   Loren. Goodly Lord, what a witte-snapper are you,
6 2270 then bid them prepare dinner
6 2271 
6 2272    Clow. That is done to sir, onely couer is the word
6 2273 
6 2274    Loren. Will you couer than sir?
6 2275   Clow. Not so sir neither, I know my dutie
6 2276 
6 2277    Loren. Yet more quarreling with occasion, wilt thou
6 2278 shew the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant; I pray
6 2279 thee vnderstand a plaine man in his plaine meaning: goe
6 2280 to thy fellowes, bid them couer the table, serue in the
6 2281 meat, and we will come in to dinner
6 2282 
6 2283    Clow. For the table sir, it shall be seru'd in, for the
6 2284 meat sir, it shall bee couered, for your comming in to
6 2285 dinner sir, why let it be as humors and conceits shall gouerne.
6 2286 
6 2287 Exit Clowne.
6 2288 
6 2289   Lor. O deare discretion, how his words are suted,
6 2290 The foole hath planted in his memory
6 2291 An Armie of good words, and I doe know
6 2292 A many fooles that stand in better place,
6 2293 Garnisht like him, that for a tricksie word
6 2294 Defie the matter: how cheer'st thou Iessica,
6 2295 And now good sweet say thy opinion,
6 2296 How dost thou like the Lord Bassiano's wife?
6 2297   Iessi. Past all expressing, it is very meete
6 2298 The Lord Bassanio liue an vpright life
6 2299 For hauing such a blessing in his Lady,
6 2300 He findes the ioyes of heauen heere on earth,
6 2301 And if on earth he doe not meane it, it
6 2302 Is reason he should neuer come to heauen?
6 2303 Why, if two gods should play some heauenly match,
6 2304 And on the wager lay two earthly women,
6 2305 And Portia one: there must be something else
6 2306 Paund with the other, for the poore rude world
6 2307 Hath not her fellow
6 2308 
6 2309    Loren. Euen such a husband
6 2310 Hast thou of me, as she is for a wife
6 2311 
6 2312    Ies. Nay, but aske my opinion to of that?
6 2313   Lor. I will anone, first let vs goe to dinner?
6 2314   Ies. Nay, let me praise you while I haue a stomacke?
6 2315   Lor. No pray thee, let it serue for table talke,
6 2316 Then how som ere thou speakst 'mong other things,
6 2317 I shall digest it?
6 2318   Iessi. Well, Ile set you forth.
6 2319 
6 2320 Exeunt.
6 2321 
6 2322 
6 2323 Actus Quartus.
6 2324 
6 2325 Enter the Duke, the Magnificoes, Anthonio, Bassanio, and
6 2326 Gratiano
6 2327 
6 2328    Duke. What, is Anthonio heere?
6 2329   Ant. Ready, so please your grace?
6 2330   Duke. I am sorry for thee, thou art come to answere
6 2331 A stonie aduersary, an inhumane wretch,
6 2332 Vncapable of pitty, voyd, and empty
6 2333 From any dram of mercie
6 2334 
6 2335    Ant. I haue heard
6 2336 Your Grace hath tane great paines to qualifie
6 2337 His rigorous course: but since he stands obdurate,
6 2338 And that no lawful meanes can carrie me
6 2339 Out of his enuies reach, I do oppose
6 2340 My patience to his fury, and am arm'd
6 2341 To suffer with a quietnesse of spirit,
6 2342 The very tiranny and rage of his
6 2343 
6 2344    Du. Go one and cal the Iew into the Court
6 2345 
6 2346    Sal. He is ready at the doore, he comes my Lord.
6 2347 Enter Shylocke.
6 2348 
6 2349   Du. Make roome, and let him stand before our face.
6 2350 Shylocke the world thinkes, and I thinke so to
6 2351 That thou but leadest this fashion of thy mallice
6 2352 To the last houre of act, and then 'tis thought
6 2353 Thou'lt shew thy mercy and remorse more strange,
6 2354 Than is thy strange apparant cruelty;
6 2355 And where thou now exact'st the penalty,
6 2356 Which is a pound of this poore Merchants flesh,
6 2357 Thou wilt not onely loose the forfeiture,
6 2358 But touch'd with humane gentlenesse and loue:
6 2359 Forgiue a moytie of the principall,
6 2360 Glancing an eye of pitty on his losses
6 2361 That haue of late so hudled on his backe,
6 2362 Enow to presse a royall Merchant downe;
6 2363 And plucke commiseration of his state
6 2364 From brassie bosomes, and rough hearts of flints,
6 2365 From stubborne Turkes and Tarters neuer traind
6 2366 To offices of tender curtesie,
6 2367 We all expect a gentle answer Iew?
6 2368   Iew. I haue possest your grace of what I purpose,
6 2369 And by our holy Sabbath haue I sworne
6 2370 To haue the due and forfeit of my bond.
6 2371 If you denie it, let the danger light
6 2372 Vpon your Charter, and your Cities freedome.
6 2373 You'l aske me why I rather choose to haue
6 2374 A weight of carrion flesh, then to receiue
6 2375 Three thousand Ducats? Ile not answer that:
6 2376 But say it is my humor; Is it answered?
6 2377 What if my house be troubled with a Rat,
6 2378 And I be pleas'd to giue ten thousand Ducates
6 2379 To haue it bain'd? What, are you answer'd yet?
6 2380 Some men there are loue not a gaping Pigge:
6 2381 Some that are mad, if they behold a Cat:
6 2382 And others, when the bag-pipe sings i'th nose,
6 2383 Cannot containe their Vrine for affection.
6 2384 Masters of passion swayes it to the moode
6 2385 Of what it likes or loaths, now for your answer:
6 2386 As there is no firme reason to be rendred
6 2387 Why he cannot abide a gaping Pigge?
6 2388 Why he a harmlesse necessarie Cat?
6 2389 Why he a woollen bag-pipe: but of force
6 2390 Must yeeld to such ineuitable shame,
6 2391 As to offend himselfe being offended:
6 2392 So can I giue no reason, nor I will not,
6 2393 More then a lodg'd hate, and a certaine loathing
6 2394 I beare Anthonio, that I follow thus
6 2395 A loosing suite against him? Are you answered?
6 2396   Bass. This is no answer thou vnfeeling man,
6 2397 To excuse the currant of thy cruelty
6 2398 
6 2399    Iew. I am not bound to please thee with my answer
6 2400 
6 2401    Bass. Do all men kil the things they do not loue?
6 2402   Iew. Hates any man the thing he would not kill?
6 2403   Bass. Euerie offence is not a hate at first
6 2404 
6 2405    Iew. What wouldst thou haue a Serpent sting thee
6 2406 twice?
6 2407   Ant. I pray you thinke you question with the Iew:
6 2408 You may as well go stand vpon the beach,
6 2409 And bid the maine flood baite his vsuall height,
6 2410 Or euen as well vse question with the Wolfe,
6 2411 The Ewe bleate for the Lambe:
6 2412 You may as well forbid the Mountaine Pines
6 2413 To wagge their high tops, and to make no noise
6 2414 When they are fretted with the gusts of heauen:
6 2415 You may as well do any thing most hard,
6 2416 As seeke to soften that, then which what harder?
6 2417 His Iewish heart. Therefore I do beseech you
6 2418 Make no more offers, vse no farther meanes,
6 2419 But with all briefe and plaine conueniencie
6 2420 Let me haue iudgement, and the Iew his will
6 2421 
6 2422    Bas. For thy three thousand Ducates heere is six
6 2423 
6 2424    Iew. If euerie Ducat in sixe thousand Ducates
6 2425 Were in sixe parts, and euery part a Ducate,
6 2426 I would not draw them, I would haue my bond?
6 2427   Du. How shalt thou hope for mercie, rendring none?
6 2428   Iew. What iudgement shall I dread doing no wrong?
6 2429 You haue among you many a purchast slaue,
6 2430 Which like your Asses, and your Dogs and Mules,
6 2431 You vse in abiect and in slauish parts,
6 2432 Because you bought them. Shall I say to you,
6 2433 Let them be free, marrie them to your heires?
6 2434 Why sweate they vnder burthens? Let their beds
6 2435 Be made as soft as yours: and let their pallats
6 2436 Be season'd with such Viands: you will answer
6 2437 The slaues are ours. So do I answer you.
6 2438 The pound of flesh which I demand of him
6 2439 Is deerely bought, 'tis mine, and I will haue it.
6 2440 If you deny me; fie vpon your Law,
6 2441 There is no force in the decrees of Venice;
6 2442 I stand for iudgement, answer, Shall I haue it?
6 2443   Du. Vpon my power I may dismisse this Court,
6 2444 Vnlesse Bellario a learned Doctor,
6 2445 Whom I haue sent for to determine this,
6 2446 Come heere to day
6 2447 
6 2448    Sal. My Lord, heere stayes without
6 2449 A Messenger with Letters from the Doctor,
6 2450 New come from Padua
6 2451 
6 2452    Du. Bring vs the Letters, Call the Messengers
6 2453 
6 2454    Bass. Good cheere Anthonio. What man, corage yet:
6 2455 The Iew shall haue my flesh, blood, bones, and all,
6 2456 Ere thou shalt loose for me one drop of blood
6 2457 
6 2458    Ant. I am a tainted Weather of the flocke,
6 2459 Meetest for death, the weakest kinde of fruite
6 2460 Drops earliest to the ground, and so let me;
6 2461 You cannot better be employ'd Bassanio,
6 2462 Then to liue still, and write mine Epitaph.
6 2463 Enter Nerrissa.
6 2464 
6 2465   Du. Came you from Padua from Bellario?
6 2466   Ner. From both.
6 2467 My Lord Bellario greets your Grace
6 2468 
6 2469    Bas. Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?
6 2470   Iew. To cut the forfeiture from that bankrout there
6 2471 
6 2472    Gra. Not on thy soale: but on thy soule harsh Iew
6 2473 Thou mak'st thy knife keene: but no mettall can,
6 2474 No, not the hangmans Axe beare halfe the keennesse
6 2475 Of thy sharpe enuy. Can no prayers pierce thee?
6 2476   Iew. No, none that thou hast wit enough to make
6 2477 
6 2478    Gra. O be thou damn'd, inexecrable dogge,
6 2479 And for thy life let iustice be accus'd:
6 2480 Thou almost mak'st me wauer in my faith;
6 2481 To hold opinion with Pythagoras,
6 2482 That soules of Animals infuse themselues
6 2483 Into the trunkes of men. Thy currish spirit
6 2484 Gouern'd a Wolfe, who hang'd for humane slaughter,
6 2485 Euen from the gallowes did his fell soule fleet;
6 2486 And whil'st thou layest in thy vnhallowed dam,
6 2487 Infus'd it selfe in thee: For thy desires
6 2488 Are Woluish, bloody, steru'd, and rauenous
6 2489 
6 2490    Iew. Till thou canst raile the seale from off my bond
6 2491 Thou but offend'st thy Lungs to speake so loud:
6 2492 Repaire thy wit good youth, or it will fall
6 2493 To endlesse ruine. I stand heere for Law
6 2494 
6 2495    Du. This Letter from Bellario doth commend
6 2496 A yong and Learned Doctor in our Court;
6 2497 Where is he?
6 2498   Ner. He attendeth heere hard by
6 2499 To know your answer, whether you'l admit him
6 2500 
6 2501    Du. With all my heart. Some three or four of you
6 2502 Go giue him curteous conduct to this place,
6 2503 Meane time the Court shall heare Bellarioes Letter.
6 2504 Your Grace shall vnderstand, that at the receite of your
6 2505 Letter I am very sicke: but in the instant that your messenger
6 2506 came, in louing visitation, was with me a yong Doctor
6 2507 of Rome, his name is Balthasar: I acquainted him with
6 2508 the cause in Controuersie, betweene the Iew and Anthonio
6 2509 the Merchant: We turn'd ore many Bookes together: hee is
6 2510 furnished with my opinion, which bettred with his owne learning,
6 2511 the greatnesse whereof I cannot enough commend, comes
6 2512 with him at my importunity, to fill vp your Graces request in
6 2513 my sted. I beseech you, let his lacke of years be no impediment
6 2514 to let him lacke a reuerend estimation: for I neuer knewe so
6 2515 yong a body, with so old a head. I leaue him to your gracious
6 2516 acceptance, whose trial shall better publish his commendation.
6 2517 Enter Portia for Balthazar.
6 2518 
6 2519   Duke. You heare the learn'd Bellario what he writes,
6 2520 And heere (I take it) is the Doctor come.
6 2521 Giue me your hand: Came you from old Bellario?
6 2522   Por. I did my Lord
6 2523 
6 2524    Du. You are welcome: take your place;
6 2525 Are you acquainted with the difference
6 2526 That holds this present question in the Court
6 2527 
6 2528    Por. I am enformed throughly of the cause.
6 2529 Which is the Merchant heere? and which the Iew?
6 2530   Du. Anthonio and old Shylocke, both stand forth
6 2531 
6 2532    Por. Is your name Shylocke?
6 2533   Iew. Shylocke is my name
6 2534 
6 2535    Por. Of a strange nature is the sute you follow,
6 2536 Yet in such rule, that the Venetian Law
6 2537 Cannot impugne you as you do proceed.
6 2538 You stand within his danger, do you not?
6 2539   Ant. I, so he sayes
6 2540 
6 2541    Por. Do you confesse the bond?
6 2542   Ant. I do
6 2543 
6 2544    Por. Then must the Iew be mercifull
6 2545 
6 2546    Iew. On what compulsion must I ? Tell me that
6 2547 
6 2548    Por. The quality of mercy is not strain'd,
6 2549 It droppeth as the gentle raine from heauen
6 2550 Vpon the place beneath. It is twice blest,
6 2551 It blesseth him that giues, and him that takes,
6 2552 'Tis mightiest in the mightiest, it becomes
6 2553 The throned Monarch better then his Crowne.
6 2554 His Scepter shewes the force of temporall power,
6 2555 The attribute to awe and Maiestie,
6 2556 Wherein doth sit the dread and feare of Kings:
6 2557 But mercy is aboue this sceptred sway,
6 2558 It is enthroned in the hearts of Kings,
6 2559 It is an attribute to God himselfe;
6 2560 And earthly power doth then shew likest Gods
6 2561 When mercie seasons Iustice. Therefore Iew,
6 2562 Though Iustice be thy plea, consider this,
6 2563 That in the course of Iustice, none of vs
6 2564 Should see saluation: we do pray for mercie,
6 2565 And that same prayer, doth teach vs all to render
6 2566 The deeds of mercie. I haue spoke thus much
6 2567 To mittigate the iustice of thy plea:
6 2568 Which if thou follow, this strict course of Venice
6 2569 Must needes giue sentence 'gainst the Merchant there
6 2570 
6 2571    Shy. My deeds vpon my head, I craue the Law,
6 2572 The penaltie and forfeite of my bond
6 2573 
6 2574    Por. Is he not able to discharge the money?
6 2575   Bas. Yes, heere I tender it for him in the Court,
6 2576 Yea, twice the summe, if that will not suffice,
6 2577 I will be bound to pay it ten times ore,
6 2578 On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart:
6 2579 If this will not suffice, it must appeare
6 2580 That malice beares downe truth. And I beseech you
6 2581 Wrest once the Law to your authority.
6 2582 To do a great right, do a little wrong,
6 2583 And curbe this cruell diuell of his will
6 2584 
6 2585    Por. It must not be, there is no power in Venice
6 2586 Can alter a decree established:
6 2587 'Twill be recorded for a President,
6 2588 And many an error by the same example,
6 2589 Will rush into the state: It cannot be
6 2590 
6 2591    Iew. A Daniel come to iudgement, yea a Daniel.
6 2592 O wise young Iudge, how do I honour thee
6 2593 
6 2594    Por. I pray you let me looke vpon the bond
6 2595 
6 2596    Iew. Heere 'tis most reuerend Doctor, heere it is
6 2597 
6 2598    Por. Shylocke, there's thrice thy monie offered thee
6 2599 
6 2600    Shy. An oath, an oath, I haue an oath in heauen:
6 2601 Shall I lay periurie vpon my soule?
6 2602 No not for Venice
6 2603 
6 2604    Por. Why this bond is forfeit,
6 2605 And lawfully by this the Iew may claime
6 2606 A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off
6 2607 Neerest the Merchants heart; be mercifull,
6 2608 Take thrice thy money, bid me teare the bond
6 2609 
6 2610    Iew. When it is paid according to the tenure.
6 2611 It doth appeare you are a worthy Iudge:
6 2612 You know the Law, your exposition
6 2613 Hath beene most sound. I charge you by the Law,
6 2614 Whereof you are a well-deseruing pillar,
6 2615 Proceede to iudgement: By my soule I sweare,
6 2616 There is no power in the tongue of man
6 2617 To alter me: I stay heere on my bond
6 2618 
6 2619    An. Most heartily I do beseech the Court
6 2620 To giue the iudgement
6 2621 
6 2622    Por. Why then thus it is:
6 2623 You must prepare your bosome for his knife
6 2624 
6 2625    Iew. O noble Iudge, O excellent yong man
6 2626 
6 2627    Por. For the intent and purpose of the Law
6 2628 Hath full relation to the penaltie,
6 2629 Which heere appeareth due vpon the bond
6 2630 
6 2631    Iew. 'Tis verie true: O wise and vpright Iudge,
6 2632 How much more elder art thou then thy lookes?
6 2633   Por. Therefore lay bare your bosome
6 2634 
6 2635    Iew. I, his brest,
6 2636 So sayes the bond, doth it not noble Iudge?
6 2637 Neerest his heart, those are the very words
6 2638 
6 2639    Por. It is so: Are there ballance heere to weigh the
6 2640 flesh?
6 2641   Iew. I haue them ready
6 2642 
6 2643    Por. Haue by some Surgeon Shylock on your charge
6 2644 To stop his wounds, least he should bleede to death
6 2645 
6 2646    Iew. It is not nominated in the bond?
6 2647   Por. It is not so exprest: but what of that?
6 2648 'Twere good you do so much for charitie
6 2649 
6 2650    Iew. I cannot finde it, 'tis not in the bond
6 2651 
6 2652    Por. Come Merchant, haue you any thing to say?
6 2653   Ant. But little: I am arm'd and well prepar'd.
6 2654 Giue me your hand Bassanio, fare you well.
6 2655 Greeue not that I am falne to this for you:
6 2656 For heerein fortune shewes her selfe more kinde
6 2657 Then is her custome. It is still her vse
6 2658 To let the wretched man out-liue his wealth,
6 2659 To view with hollow eye, and wrinkled brow
6 2660 An age of pouerty. From which lingring penance
6 2661 Of such miserie, doth she cut me off:
6 2662 Commend me to your honourable Wife,
6 2663 Tell her the processe of Anthonio's end:
6 2664 Say how I lou'd you; speake me faire in death:
6 2665 And when the tale is told, bid her be iudge,
6 2666 Whether Bassanio had not once a Loue:
6 2667 Repent not you that you shall loose your friend,
6 2668 And he repents not that he payes your debt.
6 2669 For if the Iew do cut but deepe enough,
6 2670 Ile pay it instantly, with all my heart
6 2671 
6 2672    Bas. Anthonio, I am married to a wife,
6 2673 Which is as deere to me as life it selfe,
6 2674 But life it selfe, my wife, and all the world,
6 2675 Are not with me esteem'd aboue thy life.
6 2676 I would loose all, I sacrifice them all
6 2677 Heere to this deuill, to deliuer you
6 2678 
6 2679    Por. Your wife would giue you little thanks for that
6 2680 If she were by to heare you make the offer
6 2681 
6 2682    Gra. I haue a wife whom I protest I loue,
6 2683 I would she were in heauen, so she could
6 2684 Intreat some power to change this currish Iew
6 2685 
6 2686    Ner. 'Tis well you offer it behinde her backe,
6 2687 The wish would make else an vnquiet house
6 2688 
6 2689    Iew. These be the Christian husbands: I haue a daughter
6 2690 Would any of the stocke of Barrabas
6 2691 Had beene her husband, rather then a Christian.
6 2692 We trifle time, I pray thee pursue sentence
6 2693 
6 2694    Por. A pound of that same marchants flesh is thine,
6 2695 The Court awards it, and the law doth giue it
6 2696 
6 2697    Iew. Most rightfull Iudge
6 2698 
6 2699    Por. And you must cut this flesh from off his breast,
6 2700 The Law allowes it, and the Court awards it
6 2701 
6 2702    Iew. Most learned Iudge, a sentence, come prepare
6 2703 
6 2704    Por. Tarry a little, there is something else,
6 2705 This bond doth giue thee heere no iot of bloud,
6 2706 The words expresly are a pound of flesh:
6 2707 Then take thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh,
6 2708 But in the cutting it, if thou dost shed
6 2709 One drop of Christian bloud, thy lands and goods
6 2710 Are by the Lawes of Venice confiscate
6 2711 Vnto the state of Venice
6 2712 
6 2713    Gra. O vpright Iudge,
6 2714 Marke Iew, o learned Iudge
6 2715 
6 2716    Shy. Is that the law?
6 2717   Por. Thy selfe shalt see the Act:
6 2718 For as thou vrgest iustice, be assur'd
6 2719 Thou shalt haue iustice more then thou desirest
6 2720 
6 2721    Gra. O learned Iudge, mark Iew, a learned Iudge
6 2722 
6 2723    Iew. I take this offer then, pay the bond thrice,
6 2724 And let the Christian goe
6 2725 
6 2726    Bass. Heere is the money
6 2727 
6 2728    Por. Soft, the Iew shall haue all iustice, soft, no haste,
6 2729 He shall haue nothing but the penalty
6 2730 
6 2731    Gra. O Iew, an vpright Iudge, a learned Iudge
6 2732 
6 2733    Por. Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh,
6 2734 Shed thou no bloud, nor cut thou lesse nor more
6 2735 But iust a pound of flesh: if thou tak'st more
6 2736 Or lesse then a iust pound, be it so much
6 2737 As makes it light or heauy in the substance,
6 2738 Or the deuision of the twentieth part
6 2739 Of one poore scruple, nay if the scale doe turne
6 2740 But in the estimation of a hayre,
6 2741 Thou diest, and all thy goods are confiscate
6 2742 
6 2743    Gra. A second Daniel, a Daniel Iew,
6 2744 Now infidell I haue thee on the hip
6 2745 
6 2746    Por. Why doth the Iew pause, take thy forfeiture
6 2747 
6 2748    Shy. Giue me my principall, and let me goe
6 2749 
6 2750    Bass. I haue it ready for thee, heere it is
6 2751 
6 2752    Por. He hath refus'd it in the open Court,
6 2753 He shall haue meerly iustice and his bond
6 2754 
6 2755    Gra. A Daniel still say I, a second Daniel,
6 2756 I thanke thee Iew for teaching me that word
6 2757 
6 2758    Shy. Shall I not haue barely my principall?
6 2759   Por. Thou shalt haue nothing but the forfeiture,
6 2760 To be taken so at thy perill Iew
6 2761 
6 2762    Shy. Why then the Deuill giue him good of it:
6 2763 Ile stay no longer question
6 2764 
6 2765    Por. Tarry Iew,
6 2766 The Law hath yet another hold on you.
6 2767 It is enacted in the Lawes of Venice,
6 2768 If it be proued against an Alien,
6 2769 That by direct, or indirect attempts
6 2770 He seeke the life of any Citizen,
6 2771 The party gainst the which he doth contriue,
6 2772 Shall seaze one halfe his goods, the other halfe
6 2773 Comes to the priuie coffer of the State,
6 2774 And the offenders life lies in the mercy
6 2775 Of the Duke onely, gainst all other voice.
6 2776 In which predicament I say thou standst:
6 2777 For it appeares by manifest proceeding,
6 2778 That indirectly, and directly to,
6 2779 Thou hast contriu'd against the very life
6 2780 Of the defendant: and thou hast incur'd
6 2781 The danger formerly by me rehearst.
6 2782 Downe therefore, and beg mercy of the Duke
6 2783 
6 2784    Gra. Beg that thou maist haue leaue to hang thy selfe,
6 2785 And yet thy wealth being forfeit to the state,
6 2786 Thou hast not left the value of a cord,
6 2787 Therefore thou must be hang'd at the states charge
6 2788 
6 2789    Duk. That thou shalt see the difference of our spirit,
6 2790 I pardon thee thy life before thou aske it:
6 2791 For halfe thy wealth, it is Anthonio's
6 2792 The other halfe comes to the generall state,
6 2793 Which humblenesse may driue vnto a fine
6 2794 
6 2795    Por. I for the state, not for Anthonio
6 2796 
6 2797    Shy. Nay, take my life and all, pardon not that,
6 2798 You take my house, when you do take the prop
6 2799 That doth sustaine my house: you take my life
6 2800 When you doe take the meanes whereby I liue
6 2801 
6 2802    Por. What mercy can you render him Anthonio?
6 2803   Gra. A halter gratis, nothing else for Gods sake
6 2804 
6 2805    Ant. So please my Lord the Duke, and all the Court
6 2806 To quit the fine for one halfe of his goods,
6 2807 I am content: so he will let me haue
6 2808 The other halfe in vse, to render it
6 2809 Vpon his death, vnto the Gentleman
6 2810 That lately stole his daughter.
6 2811 Two things prouided more, that for this fauour
6 2812 He presently become a Christian:
6 2813 The other, that he doe record a gift
6 2814 Heere in the Court of all he dies possest
6 2815 Vnto his sonne Lorenzo, and his daughter
6 2816 
6 2817    Duk. He shall doe this, or else I doe recant
6 2818 The pardon that I late pronounced heere
6 2819 
6 2820    Por. Art thou contented Iew? what dost thou say?
6 2821   Shy. I am content
6 2822 
6 2823    Por. Clarke, draw a deed of gift
6 2824 
6 2825    Shy. I pray you giue me leaue to goe from hence,
6 2826 I am not well, send the deed after me,
6 2827 And I will signe it
6 2828 
6 2829    Duke. Get thee gone, but doe it
6 2830 
6 2831    Gra. In christning thou shalt haue two godfathers,
6 2832 Had I been iudge, thou shouldst haue had ten more,
6 2833 To bring thee to the gallowes, not to the font.
6 2834 Enter.
6 2835 
6 2836   Du. Sir I intreat you with me home to dinner
6 2837 
6 2838    Por. I humbly doe desire your Grace of pardon,
6 2839 I must away this night toward Padua,
6 2840 And it is meete I presently set forth
6 2841 
6 2842    Duk. I am sorry that your leysure serues you not:
6 2843 Anthonio, gratifie this gentleman,
6 2844 For in my minde you are much bound to him.
6 2845 
6 2846 Exit Duke and his traine.
6 2847 
6 2848   Bass. Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend
6 2849 Haue by your wisedome beene this day acquitted
6 2850 Of greeuous penalties, in lieu whereof,
6 2851 Three thousand Ducats due vnto the Iew
6 2852 We freely cope your curteous paines withall
6 2853 
6 2854    An. And stand indebted ouer and aboue
6 2855 In loue and seruice to you euermore
6 2856 
6 2857    Por. He is well paid that is well satisfied,
6 2858 And I deliuering you, am satisfied,
6 2859 And therein doe account my selfe well paid,
6 2860 My minde was neuer yet more mercinarie.
6 2861 I pray you know me when we meete againe,
6 2862 I wish you well, and so I take my leaue
6 2863 
6 2864    Bass. Deare sir, of force I must attempt you further,
6 2865 Take some remembrance of vs as a tribute,
6 2866 Not as fee: grant me two things, I pray you
6 2867 Not to denie me, and to pardon me
6 2868 
6 2869    Por. You presse mee farre, and therefore I will yeeld,
6 2870 Giue me your gloues, Ile weare them for your sake,
6 2871 And for your loue Ile take this ring from you,
6 2872 Doe not draw backe your hand, ile take no more,
6 2873 And you in loue shall not deny me this?
6 2874   Bass. This ring good sir, alas it is a trifle,
6 2875 I will not shame my selfe to giue you this
6 2876 
6 2877    Por. I wil haue nothing else but onely this,
6 2878 And now methinkes I haue a minde to it
6 2879 
6 2880    Bas. There's more depends on this then on the valew,
6 2881 The dearest ring in Venice will I giue you,
6 2882 And finde it out by proclamation,
6 2883 Onely for this I pray you pardon me
6 2884 
6 2885    Por. I see sir you are liberall in offers,
6 2886 You taught me first to beg, and now me thinkes
6 2887 You teach me how a beggar should be answer'd
6 2888 
6 2889    Bas. Good sir, this ring was giuen me by my wife,
6 2890 And when she put it on, she made me vow
6 2891 That I should neither sell, nor giue, nor lose it
6 2892 
6 2893    Por. That scuse serues many men to saue their gifts,
6 2894 And if your wife be not a mad woman,
6 2895 And know how well I haue deseru'd this ring,
6 2896 Shee would not hold out enemy for euer
6 2897 For giuing it to me: well, peace be with you.
6 2898 
6 2899 Exeunt.
6 2900 
6 2901   Ant. My L[ord]. Bassanio, let him haue the ring,
6 2902 Let his deseruings and my loue withall
6 2903 Be valued against your wiues commandement
6 2904 
6 2905    Bass. Goe Gratiano, run and ouer-take him,
6 2906 Giue him the ring, and bring him if thou canst
6 2907 Vnto Anthonios house, away, make haste.
6 2908 
6 2909 Exit Grati.
6 2910 
6 2911 Come, you and I will thither presently,
6 2912 And in the morning early will we both
6 2913 Flie toward Belmont, come Anthonio.
6 2914 
6 2915 Exeunt.
6 2916 
6 2917 Enter Portia and Nerrissa.
6 2918 
6 2919   Por. Enquire the Iewes house out, giue him this deed,
6 2920 And let him signe it, wee'll away to night,
6 2921 And be a day before our husbands home:
6 2922 This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo.
6 2923 Enter Gratiano.
6 2924 
6 2925   Gra. Faire sir, you are well ore-tane:
6 2926 My L[ord]. Bassanio vpon more aduice,
6 2927 Hath sent you heere this ring, and doth intreat
6 2928 Your company at dinner
6 2929 
6 2930    Por. That cannot be;
6 2931 His ring I doe accept most thankfully,
6 2932 And so I pray you tell him: furthermore,
6 2933 I pray you shew my youth old Shylockes house
6 2934 
6 2935    Gra. That will I doe
6 2936 
6 2937    Ner. Sir, I would speake with you:
6 2938 Ile see if I can get my husbands ring
6 2939 Which I did make him sweare to keepe for euer
6 2940 
6 2941    Por. Thou maist I warrant, we shal haue old swearing
6 2942 That they did giue the rings away to men;
6 2943 But weele out-face them, and out-sweare them to:
6 2944 Away, make haste, thou know'st where I will tarry
6 2945 
6 2946    Ner. Come good sir, will you shew me to this house.
6 2947 
6 2948 Exeunt.
6 2949 
6 2950 
6 2951 Actus Quintus.
6 2952 
6 2953 Enter Lorenzo and Iessica.
6 2954 
6 2955   Lor. The moone shines bright. In such a night as this,
6 2956 When the sweet winde did gently kisse the trees,
6 2957 And they did make no noyse, in such a night
6 2958 Troylus me thinkes mounted the Troian walls,
6 2959 And sigh'd his soule toward the Grecian tents
6 2960 Where Cressed lay that night
6 2961 
6 2962    Ies. In such a night
6 2963 Did Thisbie fearefully ore-trip the dewe,
6 2964 And saw the Lyons shadow ere himselfe,
6 2965 And ranne dismayed away
6 2966 
6 2967    Loren. In such a night
6 2968 Stood Dido with a Willow in her hand
6 2969 Vpon the wilde sea bankes, and waft her Loue
6 2970 To come againe to Carthage
6 2971 
6 2972    Ies. In such a night
6 2973 Medea gathered the inchanted hearbs
6 2974 That did renew old Eson
6 2975 
6 2976    Loren. In such a night
6 2977 Did Iessica steale from the wealthy Iewe,
6 2978 And with an Vnthrift Loue did runne from Venice,
6 2979 As farre as Belmont
6 2980 
6 2981    Ies. In such a night
6 2982 Did young Lorenzo sweare he lou'd her well,
6 2983 Stealing her soule with many vowes of faith,
6 2984 And nere a true one
6 2985 
6 2986    Loren. In such a night
6 2987 Did pretty Iessica (like a little shrow)
6 2988 Slander her Loue, and he forgaue it her
6 2989 
6 2990    Iessi. I would out-night you did no body come:
6 2991 But harke, I heare the footing of a man.
6 2992 Enter Messenger.
6 2993 
6 2994   Lor. Who comes so fast in silence of the night?
6 2995   Mes. A friend
6 2996 
6 2997    Loren. A friend, what friend? your name I pray you friend?
6 2998   Mes. Stephano is my name, and I bring word
6 2999 My Mistresse will before the breake of day
6 3000 Be heere at Belmont, she doth stray about
6 3001 By holy crosses where she kneeles and prayes
6 3002 For happy wedlocke houres
6 3003 
6 3004    Loren. Who comes with her?
6 3005   Mes. None but a holy Hermit and her maid:
6 3006 I pray you is my Master yet return'd?
6 3007   Loren. He is not, nor we haue not heard from him,
6 3008 But goe we in I pray thee Iessica,
6 3009 And ceremoniously let vs prepare
6 3010 Some welcome for the Mistresse of the house,
6 3011 Enter Clowne.
6 3012 
6 3013   Clo. Sola, sola: wo ha ho, sola, sola
6 3014 
6 3015    Loren. Who calls?
6 3016   Clo. Sola, did you see M[aster]. Lorenzo, & M[aster]. Lorenzo,
6 3017 sola,
6 3018   Lor. Leaue hollowing man, heere
6 3019 
6 3020    Clo. Sola, where, where?
6 3021   Lor. Heere?
6 3022   Clo. Tel him ther's a Post come from my Master, with
6 3023 his horne full of good newes, my Master will be here ere
6 3024 morning sweete soule
6 3025 
6 3026    Loren. Let's in, and there expect their comming.
6 3027 And yet no matter: why should we goe in?
6 3028 My friend Stephen, signifie pray you
6 3029 Within the house, your Mistresse is at hand,
6 3030 And bring your musique foorth into the ayre.
6 3031 How sweet the moone-light sleepes vpon this banke,
6 3032 Heere will we sit, and let the sounds of musicke
6 3033 Creepe in our eares soft stilnes, and the night
6 3034 Become the tutches of sweet harmonie:
6 3035 Sit Iessica, looke how the floore of heauen
6 3036 Is thicke inlayed with pattens of bright gold,
6 3037 There's not the smallest orbe which thou beholdst
6 3038 But in his motion like an Angell sings,
6 3039 Still quiring to the young eyed Cherubins;
6 3040 Such harmonie is in immortall soules,
6 3041 But whilst this muddy vesture of decay
6 3042 Doth grosly close in it, we cannot heare it:
6 3043 Come hoe, and wake Diana with a hymne,
6 3044 With sweetest tutches pearce your Mistresse eare,
6 3045 And draw her home with musicke
6 3046 
6 3047    Iessi. I am neuer merry when I heare sweet musique.
6 3048 
6 3049 Play musicke.
6 3050 
6 3051   Lor. The reason is, your spirits are attentiue:
6 3052 For doe but note a wilde and wanton heard
6 3053 Or race of youthful and vnhandled colts,
6 3054 Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,
6 3055 Which is the hot condition of their bloud,
6 3056 If they but heare perchance a trumpet sound,
6 3057 Or any ayre of musicke touch their eares,
6 3058 You shall perceiue them make a mutuall stand,
6 3059 Their sauage eyes turn'd to a modest gaze,
6 3060 By the sweet power of musicke: therefore the Poet
6 3061 Did faine that Orpheus drew trees, stones, and floods.
6 3062 Since naught so stockish, hard, and full of rage,
6 3063 But musicke for time doth change his nature,
6 3064 The man that hath no musicke in himselfe,
6 3065 Nor is not moued with concord of sweet sounds,
6 3066 Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoyles,
6 3067 The motions of his spirit are dull as night,
6 3068 And his affections darke as Erobus,
6 3069 Let no such man be trusted: marke the musicke.
6 3070 Enter Portia and Nerrissa.
6 3071 
6 3072   Por. That light we see is burning in my hall:
6 3073 How farre that little candell throwes his beames,
6 3074 So shines a good deed in a naughty world
6 3075 
6 3076    Ner. When the moone shone we did not see the candle?
6 3077   Por. So doth the greater glory dim the lesse,
6 3078 A substitute shines brightly as a King
6 3079 Vntill a King be by, and then his state
6 3080 Empties it selfe, as doth an inland brooke
6 3081 Into the maine of waters: musique, harke.
6 3082 
6 3083 Musicke.
6 3084 
6 3085   Ner. It is your musicke Madame of the house
6 3086 
6 3087    Por. Nothing is good I see without respect,
6 3088 Methinkes it sounds much sweeter then by day?
6 3089   Ner. Silence bestowes that vertue on it Madam
6 3090 
6 3091    Por. The Crow doth sing as sweetly as the Larke
6 3092 When neither is attended: and I thinke
6 3093 The Nightingale if she should sing by day
6 3094 When euery Goose is cackling, would be thought
6 3095 No better a Musitian then the Wren?
6 3096 How many things by season, season'd are
6 3097 To their right praise, and true perfection:
6 3098 Peace, how the Moone sleepes with Endimion,
6 3099 And would not be awak'd.
6 3100 
6 3101 Musicke ceases.
6 3102 
6 3103   Lor. That is the voice,
6 3104 Or I am much deceiu'd of Portia
6 3105 
6 3106    Por. He knowes me as the blinde man knowes the
6 3107 Cuckow by the bad voice?
6 3108   Lor. Deere Lady welcome home?
6 3109   Por. We haue bene praying for our husbands welfare
6 3110 Which speed we hope the better for our words,
6 3111 Are they return'd?
6 3112   Lor. Madam, they are not yet:
6 3113 But there is come a Messenger before
6 3114 To signifie their comming
6 3115 
6 3116    Por. Go in Nerrissa,
6 3117 Giue order to my seruants, that they take
6 3118 No note at all of our being absent hence,
6 3119 Nor you Lorenzo, Iessica nor you.
6 3120 
6 3121 A Tucket sounds.
6 3122 
6 3123   Lor. Your husband is at hand, I heare his Trumpet,
6 3124 We are no tell-tales Madam, feare you not
6 3125 
6 3126    Por. This night methinkes is but the daylight sicke,
6 3127 It lookes a little paler, 'tis a day,
6 3128 Such as the day is, when the Sun is hid.
6 3129 Enter Bassanio, Anthonio, Gratiano, and their Followers.
6 3130 
6 3131   Bas. We should hold day with the Antipodes,
6 3132 If you would walke in absence of the sunne
6 3133 
6 3134    Por. Let me giue light, but let me not be light,
6 3135 For a light wife doth make a heauie husband,
6 3136 And neuer be Bassanio so for me,
6 3137 But God sort all: you are welcome home my Lord
6 3138 
6 3139    Bass. I thanke you Madam, giue welcom to my friend
6 3140 This is the man, this is Anthonio,
6 3141 To whom I am so infinitely bound
6 3142 
6 3143    Por. You should in all sence be much bound to him,
6 3144 For as I heare he was much bound for you
6 3145 
6 3146    Anth. No more then I am wel acquitted of
6 3147 
6 3148    Por. Sir, you are verie welcome to our house:
6 3149 It must appeare in other waies then words,
6 3150 Therefore I scant this breathing curtesie
6 3151 
6 3152    Gra. By yonder Moone I sweare you do me wrong,
6 3153 Infaith I gaue it to the Iudges Clearke,
6 3154 Would he were gelt that had it for my part,
6 3155 Since you do take it Loue so much at hart
6 3156 
6 3157    Por. A quarrel hoe alreadie, what's the matter?
6 3158   Gra. About a hoope of Gold, a paltry Ring
6 3159 That she did giue me, whose Poesie was
6 3160 For all the world like Cutlers Poetry
6 3161 Vpon a knife; Loue mee, and leaue mee not
6 3162 
6 3163    Ner. What talke you of the Poesie or the valew:
6 3164 You swore to me when I did giue it you,
6 3165 That you would weare it til the houre of death,
6 3166 And that it should lye with you in your graue,
6 3167 Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,
6 3168 You should haue beene respectiue and haue kept it.
6 3169 Gaue it a Iudges Clearke: but wel I know
6 3170 The Clearke wil nere weare haire on's face that had it
6 3171 
6 3172    Gra. He wil, and if he liue to be a man
6 3173 
6 3174    Nerrissa. I, if a Woman liue to be a man
6 3175 
6 3176    Gra. Now by this hand I gaue it to a youth,
6 3177 A kinde of boy, a little scrubbed boy,
6 3178 No higher then thy selfe, the Iudges Clearke,
6 3179 A prating boy that begg'd it as a Fee,
6 3180 I could not for my heart deny it him
6 3181 
6 3182    Por. You were too blame, I must be plaine with you,
6 3183 To part so slightly with your wiues first gift,
6 3184 A thing stucke on with oathes vpon your finger,
6 3185 And so riueted with faith vnto your flesh.
6 3186 I gaue my Loue a Ring, and made him sweare
6 3187 Neuer to part with it, and heere he stands:
6 3188 I dare be sworne for him, he would not leaue it,
6 3189 Nor plucke it from his finger, for the wealth
6 3190 That the world masters. Now in faith Gratiano,
6 3191 You giue your wife too vnkinde a cause of greefe,
6 3192 And 'twere to me I should be mad at it
6 3193 
6 3194    Bass. Why I were best to cut my left hand off,
6 3195 And sweare I lost the Ring defending it
6 3196 
6 3197    Gra. My Lord Bassanio gaue his Ring away
6 3198 Vnto the Iudge that beg'd it, and indeede
6 3199 Deseru'd it too: and then the Boy his Clearke
6 3200 That tooke some paines in writing, he begg'd mine,
6 3201 And neyther man nor master would take ought
6 3202 But the two Rings
6 3203 
6 3204    Por. What Ring gaue you my Lord?
6 3205 Not that I hope which you receiu'd of me
6 3206 
6 3207    Bass. If I could adde a lie vnto a fault,
6 3208 I would deny it: but you see my finger
6 3209 Hath not the Ring vpon it, it is gone
6 3210 
6 3211    Por. Euen so voide is your false heart of truth.
6 3212 By heauen I wil nere come in your bed
6 3213 Vntil I see the Ring
6 3214 
6 3215    Ner. Nor I in yours, til I againe see mine
6 3216 
6 3217    Bass. Sweet Portia,
6 3218 If you did know to whom I gaue the Ring,
6 3219 If you did know for whom I gaue the Ring,
6 3220 And would conceiue for what I gaue the Ring,
6 3221 And how vnwillingly I left the Ring,
6 3222 When nought would be accepted but the Ring,
6 3223 You would abate the strength of your displeasure?
6 3224   Por. If you had knowne the vertue of the Ring,
6 3225 Or halfe her worthinesse that gaue the Ring,
6 3226 Or your owne honour to containe the Ring,
6 3227 You would not then haue parted with the Ring:
6 3228 What man is there so much vnreasonable,
6 3229 If you had pleas'd to haue defended it
6 3230 With any termes of Zeale: wanted the modestie
6 3231 To vrge the thing held as a ceremonie:
6 3232 Nerrissa teaches me what to beleeue,
6 3233 Ile die for't, but some Woman had the Ring?
6 3234   Bass. No by mine honor Madam, by my soule
6 3235 No Woman had it, but a ciuill Doctor,
6 3236 Which did refuse three thousand Ducates of me,
6 3237 And beg'd the Ring; the which I did denie him,
6 3238 And suffer'd him to go displeas'd away:
6 3239 Euen he that had held vp the verie life
6 3240 Of my deere friend. What should I say sweete Lady?
6 3241 I was inforc'd to send it after him,
6 3242 I was beset with shame and curtesie,
6 3243 My honor would not let ingratitude
6 3244 So much besmeare it. Pardon me good Lady,
6 3245 And by these blessed Candles of the night,
6 3246 Had you bene there, I thinke you would haue beg'd
6 3247 The Ring of me, to giue the worthie Doctor?
6 3248   Por. Let not that Doctor ere come neere my house,
6 3249 Since he hath got the iewell that I loued,
6 3250 And that which you did sweare to keepe for me,
6 3251 I will become as liberall as you,
6 3252 Ile not deny him any thing I haue,
6 3253 No, not my body, nor my husbands bed:
6 3254 Know him I shall, I am well sure of it.
6 3255 Lie not a night from home. Watch me like Argos,
6 3256 If you doe not, if I be left alone,
6 3257 Now by mine honour which is yet mine owne,
6 3258 Ile haue the Doctor for my bedfellow
6 3259 
6 3260    Nerrissa. And I his Clarke: therefore be well aduis'd
6 3261 How you doe leaue me to mine owne protection
6 3262 
6 3263    Gra. Well, doe you so: let not me take him then,
6 3264 For if I doe, ile mar the yong Clarks pen
6 3265 
6 3266    Ant. I am th' vnhappy subiect of these quarrels
6 3267 
6 3268    Por. Sir, grieue not you,
6 3269 You are welcome notwithstanding
6 3270 
6 3271    Bas. Portia, forgiue me this enforced wrong,
6 3272 And in the hearing of these manie friends
6 3273 I sweare to thee, euen by thine owne faire eyes
6 3274 Wherein I see my selfe
6 3275 
6 3276    Por. Marke you but that?
6 3277 In both my eyes he doubly sees himselfe:
6 3278 In each eye one, sweare by your double selfe,
6 3279 And there's an oath of credit
6 3280 
6 3281    Bas. Nay, but heare me.
6 3282 Pardon this fault, and by my soule I sweare
6 3283 I neuer more will breake an oath with thee
6 3284 
6 3285    Anth. I once did lend my bodie for thy wealth,
6 3286 Which but for him that had your husbands ring
6 3287 Had quite miscarried. I dare be bound againe,
6 3288 My soule vpon the forfeit, that your Lord
6 3289 Will neuer more breake faith aduisedlie
6 3290 
6 3291    Por. Then you shall be his suretie: giue him this,
6 3292 And bid him keepe it better then the other
6 3293 
6 3294    Ant. Heere Lord Bassanio, swear to keep this ring
6 3295 
6 3296    Bass. By heauen it is the same I gaue the Doctor
6 3297 
6 3298    Por. I had it of him: pardon Bassanio,
6 3299 For by this ring the Doctor lay with me
6 3300 
6 3301    Ner. And pardon me my gentle Gratiano,
6 3302 For that same scrubbed boy the Doctors Clarke
6 3303 In liew of this, last night did lye with me
6 3304 
6 3305    Gra. Why this is like the mending of high waies
6 3306 In Sommer, where the waies are faire enough:
6 3307 What, are we Cuckolds ere we haue deseru'd it
6 3308 
6 3309    Por. Speake not so grossely, you are all amaz'd;
6 3310 Heere is a letter, reade it at your leysure,
6 3311 It comes from Padua from Bellario,
6 3312 There you shall finde that Portia was the Doctor,
6 3313 Nerrissa there her Clarke. Lorenzo heere
6 3314 Shall witnesse I set forth as soone as you,
6 3315 And but eu'n now return'd: I haue not yet
6 3316 Entred my house. Anthonio you are welcome,
6 3317 And I haue better newes in store for you
6 3318 Then you expect: vnseale this letter soone,
6 3319 There you shall finde three of your Argosies
6 3320 Are richly come to harbour sodainlie.
6 3321 You shall not know by what strange accident
6 3322 I chanced on this letter
6 3323 
6 3324    Antho. I am dumbe
6 3325 
6 3326    Bass. Were you the Doctor, and I knew you not?
6 3327   Gra. Were you the Clark that is to make me cuckold
6 3328 
6 3329    Ner. I, but the Clark that neuer meanes to doe it,
6 3330 Vnlesse he liue vntill he be a man
6 3331 
6 3332    Bass. (Sweet Doctor) you shall be my bedfellow,
6 3333 When I am absent, then lie with my wife
6 3334 
6 3335    An. (Sweet Ladie) you haue giuen me life & liuing;
6 3336 For heere I reade for certaine that my ships
6 3337 Are safelie come to Rode
6 3338 
6 3339    Por. How now Lorenzo?
6 3340 My Clarke hath some good comforts to for you
6 3341 
6 3342    Ner. I, and Ile giue them him without a fee.
6 3343 There doe I giue to you and Iessica
6 3344 From the rich Iewe, a speciall deed of gift
6 3345 After his death, of all he dies possess'd of
6 3346 
6 3347    Loren. Faire Ladies you drop Manna in the way
6 3348 Of starued people
6 3349 
6 3350    Por. It is almost morning,
6 3351 And yet I am sure you are not satisfied
6 3352 Of these euents at full. Let vs goe in,
6 3353 And charge vs there vpon intergatories,
6 3354 And we will answer all things faithfully
6 3355 
6 3356    Gra. Let it be so, the first intergatory
6 3357 That my Nerrissa shall be sworne on, is,
6 3358 Whether till the next night she had rather stay,
6 3359 Or goe to bed, now being two houres to day,
6 3360 But were the day come, I should wish it darke,
6 3361 Till I were couching with the Doctors Clarke.
6 3362 Well, while I liue, Ile feare no other thing
6 3363 So sore, as keeping safe Nerrissas ring.
6 3364 
6 3365 Exeunt.

6 3367 FINIS. The Merchant of Venice.
