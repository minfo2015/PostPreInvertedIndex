2 2 Actus Primus. Scoena Prima.
2 3 
2 4 Thunder and Lightning. Enter three Witches.
2 5 
2 6   1. When shall we three meet againe?
2 7 In Thunder, Lightning, or in Raine?
2 8   2. When the Hurley-burley's done,
2 9 When the Battaile's lost, and wonne
2 10 
2 11    3. That will be ere the set of Sunne
2 12 
2 13    1. Where the place?
2 14   2. Vpon the Heath
2 15 
2 16    3. There to meet with Macbeth
2 17 
2 18    1. I come, Gray-Malkin
2 19 
2 20    All. Padock calls anon: faire is foule, and foule is faire,
2 21 Houer through the fogge and filthie ayre.
2 22 
2 23 Exeunt.
2 24 
2 25 
2 26 Scena Secunda.
2 27 
2 28 Alarum within. Enter King Malcome, Donalbaine, Lenox, with
2 29 attendants,
2 30 meeting a bleeding Captaine.
2 31 
2 32   King. What bloody man is that? he can report,
2 33 As seemeth by his plight, of the Reuolt
2 34 The newest state
2 35 
2 36    Mal. This is the Serieant,
2 37 Who like a good and hardie Souldier fought
2 38 'Gainst my Captiuitie: Haile braue friend;
2 39 Say to the King, the knowledge of the Broyle,
2 40 As thou didst leaue it
2 41 
2 42    Cap. Doubtfull it stood,
2 43 As two spent Swimmers, that doe cling together,
2 44 And choake their Art: The mercilesse Macdonwald
2 45 (Worthie to be a Rebell, for to that
2 46 The multiplying Villanies of Nature
2 47 Doe swarme vpon him) from the Westerne Isles
2 48 Of Kernes and Gallowgrosses is supply'd,
2 49 And Fortune on his damned Quarry smiling,
2 50 Shew'd like a Rebells Whore: but all's too weake:
2 51 For braue Macbeth (well hee deserues that Name)
2 52 Disdayning Fortune, with his brandisht Steele,
2 53 Which smoak'd with bloody execution
2 54 (Like Valours Minion) caru'd out his passage,
2 55 Till hee fac'd the Slaue:
2 56 Which neu'r shooke hands, nor bad farwell to him,
2 57 Till he vnseam'd him from the Naue toth' Chops,
2 58 And fix'd his Head vpon our Battlements
2 59 
2 60    King. O valiant Cousin, worthy Gentleman
2 61 
2 62    Cap. As whence the Sunne 'gins his reflection,
2 63 Shipwracking Stormes, and direfull Thunders:
2 64 So from that Spring, whence comfort seem'd to come,
2 65 Discomfort swells: Marke King of Scotland, marke,
2 66 No sooner Iustice had, with Valour arm'd,
2 67 Compell'd these skipping Kernes to trust their heeles,
2 68 But the Norweyan Lord, surueying vantage,
2 69 With furbusht Armes, and new supplyes of men,
2 70 Began a fresh assault
2 71 
2 72    King. Dismay'd not this our Captaines, Macbeth and
2 73 Banquoh?
2 74   Cap. Yes, as Sparrowes, Eagles;
2 75 Or the Hare, the Lyon:
2 76 If I say sooth, I must report they were
2 77 As Cannons ouer-charg'd with double Cracks,
2 78 So they doubly redoubled stroakes vpon the Foe:
2 79 Except they meant to bathe in reeking Wounds,
2 80 Or memorize another Golgotha,
2 81 I cannot tell: but I am faint,
2 82 My Gashes cry for helpe
2 83 
2 84    King. So well thy words become thee, as thy wounds,
2 85 They smack of Honor both: Goe get him Surgeons.
2 86 Enter Rosse and Angus.
2 87 
2 88 Who comes here?
2 89   Mal. The worthy Thane of Rosse
2 90 
2 91    Lenox. What a haste lookes through his eyes?
2 92 So should he looke, that seemes to speake things strange
2 93 
2 94    Rosse. God saue the King
2 95 
2 96    King. Whence cam'st thou, worthy Thane?
2 97   Rosse. From Fiffe, great King,
2 98 Where the Norweyan Banners flowt the Skie,
2 99 And fanne our people cold.
2 100 Norway himselfe, with terrible numbers,
2 101 Assisted by that most disloyall Traytor,
2 102 The Thane of Cawdor, began a dismall Conflict,
2 103 Till that Bellona's Bridegroome, lapt in proofe,
2 104 Confronted him with selfe-comparisons,
2 105 Point against Point, rebellious Arme 'gainst Arme,
2 106 Curbing his lauish spirit: and to conclude,
2 107 The Victorie fell on vs
2 108 
2 109    King. Great happinesse
2 110 
2 111    Rosse. That now Sweno, the Norwayes King,
2 112 Craues composition:
2 113 Nor would we deigne him buriall of his men,
2 114 Till he disbursed, at Saint Colmes ynch,
2 115 Ten thousand Dollars, to our generall vse
2 116 
2 117    King. No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceiue
2 118 Our Bosome interest: Goe pronounce his present death,
2 119 And with his former Title greet Macbeth
2 120 
2 121    Rosse. Ile see it done
2 122 
2 123    King. What he hath lost, Noble Macbeth hath wonne.
2 124 
2 125 Exeunt.
2 126 
2 127 
2 128 Scena Tertia.
2 129 
2 130 Thunder. Enter the three Witches.
2 131 
2 132   1. Where hast thou beene, Sister?
2 133   2. Killing Swine
2 134 
2 135    3. Sister, where thou?
2 136   1. A Saylors Wife had Chestnuts in her Lappe,
2 137 And mouncht, & mouncht, and mouncht:
2 138 Giue me, quoth I.
2 139 Aroynt thee, Witch, the rumpe-fed Ronyon cryes.
2 140 Her Husband's to Aleppo gone, Master o'th' Tiger:
2 141 But in a Syue Ile thither sayle,
2 142 And like a Rat without a tayle,
2 143 Ile doe, Ile doe, and Ile doe
2 144 
2 145    2. Ile giue thee a Winde
2 146 
2 147    1. Th'art kinde
2 148 
2 149    3. And I another
2 150 
2 151    1. I my selfe haue all the other,
2 152 And the very Ports they blow,
2 153 All the Quarters that they know,
2 154 I'th' Ship-mans Card.
2 155 Ile dreyne him drie as Hay:
2 156 Sleepe shall neyther Night nor Day
2 157 Hang vpon his Pent-house Lid:
2 158 He shall liue a man forbid:
2 159 Wearie Seu'nights, nine times nine,
2 160 Shall he dwindle, peake, and pine:
2 161 Though his Barke cannot be lost,
2 162 Yet it shall be Tempest-tost.
2 163 Looke what I haue
2 164 
2 165    2. Shew me, shew me
2 166 
2 167    1. Here I haue a Pilots Thumbe,
2 168 Wrackt, as homeward he did come.
2 169 
2 170 Drum within.
2 171 
2 172   3. A Drumme, a Drumme:
2 173 Macbeth doth come
2 174 
2 175    All. The weyward Sisters, hand in hand,
2 176 Posters of the Sea and Land,
2 177 Thus doe goe, about, about,
2 178 Thrice to thine, and thrice to mine,
2 179 And thrice againe, to make vp nine.
2 180 Peace, the Charme's wound vp.
2 181 Enter Macbeth and Banquo.
2 182 
2 183   Macb. So foule and faire a day I haue not seene
2 184 
2 185    Banquo. How farre is't call'd to Soris? What are these,
2 186 So wither'd, and so wilde in their attyre,
2 187 That looke not like th' Inhabitants o'th' Earth,
2 188 And yet are on't? Liue you, or are you aught
2 189 That man may question? you seeme to vnderstand me,
2 190 By each at once her choppie finger laying
2 191 Vpon her skinnie Lips: you should be Women,
2 192 And yet your Beards forbid me to interprete
2 193 That you are so
2 194 
2 195    Mac. Speake if you can: what are you?
2 196   1. All haile Macbeth, haile to thee Thane of Glamis
2 197 
2 198    2. All haile Macbeth, haile to thee Thane of Cawdor
2 199 
2 200    3. All haile Macbeth, that shalt be King hereafter
2 201 
2 202    Banq. Good Sir, why doe you start, and seeme to feare
2 203 Things that doe sound so faire? i'th' name of truth
2 204 Are ye fantasticall, or that indeed
2 205 Which outwardly ye shew? My Noble Partner
2 206 You greet with present Grace, and great prediction
2 207 Of Noble hauing, and of Royall hope,
2 208 That he seemes wrapt withall: to me you speake not.
2 209 If you can looke into the Seedes of Time,
2 210 And say, which Graine will grow, and which will not,
2 211 Speake then to me, who neyther begge, nor feare
2 212 Your fauors, nor your hate
2 213 
2 214    1. Hayle
2 215 
2 216    2. Hayle
2 217 
2 218    3. Hayle
2 219 
2 220    1. Lesser than Macbeth, and greater
2 221 
2 222    2. Not so happy, yet much happyer
2 223 
2 224    3. Thou shalt get Kings, though thou be none:
2 225 So all haile Macbeth, and Banquo
2 226 
2 227    1. Banquo, and Macbeth, all haile
2 228 
2 229    Macb. Stay you imperfect Speakers, tell me more:
2 230 By Sinells death, I know I am Thane of Glamis,
2 231 But how, of Cawdor? the Thane of Cawdor liues
2 232 A prosperous Gentleman: And to be King,
2 233 Stands not within the prospect of beleefe,
2 234 No more then to be Cawdor. Say from whence
2 235 You owe this strange Intelligence, or why
2 236 Vpon this blasted Heath you stop our way
2 237 With such Prophetique greeting?
2 238 Speake, I charge you.
2 239 
2 240 Witches vanish.
2 241 
2 242   Banq. The Earth hath bubbles, as the Water ha's,
2 243 And these are of them: whither are they vanish'd?
2 244   Macb. Into the Ayre: and what seem'd corporall,
2 245 Melted, as breath into the Winde.
2 246 Would they had stay'd
2 247 
2 248    Banq. Were such things here, as we doe speake about?
2 249 Or haue we eaten on the insane Root,
2 250 That takes the Reason Prisoner?
2 251   Macb. Your Children shall be Kings
2 252 
2 253    Banq. You shall be King
2 254 
2 255    Macb. And Thane of Cawdor too: went it not so?
2 256   Banq. Toth' selfe-same tune and words: who's here?
2 257 Enter Rosse and Angus.
2 258 
2 259   Rosse. The King hath happily receiu'd, Macbeth,
2 260 The newes of thy successe: and when he reades
2 261 Thy personall Venture in the Rebels sight,
2 262 His Wonders and his Prayses doe contend,
2 263 Which should be thine, or his: silenc'd with that,
2 264 In viewing o're the rest o'th' selfe-same day,
2 265 He findes thee in the stout Norweyan Rankes,
2 266 Nothing afeard of what thy selfe didst make
2 267 Strange Images of death, as thick as Tale
2 268 Can post with post, and euery one did beare
2 269 Thy prayses in his Kingdomes great defence,
2 270 And powr'd them downe before him
2 271 
2 272    Ang. Wee are sent,
2 273 To giue thee from our Royall Master thanks,
2 274 Onely to harrold thee into his sight,
2 275 Not pay thee
2 276 
2 277    Rosse. And for an earnest of a greater Honor,
2 278 He bad me, from him, call thee Thane of Cawdor:
2 279 In which addition, haile most worthy Thane,
2 280 For it is thine
2 281 
2 282    Banq. What, can the Deuill speake true?
2 283   Macb. The Thane of Cawdor liues:
2 284 Why doe you dresse me in borrowed Robes?
2 285   Ang. Who was the Thane, liues yet,
2 286 But vnder heauie Iudgement beares that Life,
2 287 Which he deserues to loose.
2 288 Whether he was combin'd with those of Norway,
2 289 Or did lyne the Rebell with hidden helpe,
2 290 And vantage; or that with both he labour'd
2 291 In his Countreyes wracke, I know not:
2 292 But Treasons Capitall, confess'd, and prou'd,
2 293 Haue ouerthrowne him
2 294 
2 295    Macb. Glamys, and Thane of Cawdor:
2 296 The greatest is behinde. Thankes for your paines.
2 297 Doe you not hope your Children shall be Kings,
2 298 When those that gaue the Thane of Cawdor to me,
2 299 Promis'd no lesse to them
2 300 
2 301    Banq. That trusted home,
2 302 Might yet enkindle you vnto the Crowne,
2 303 Besides the Thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:
2 304 And oftentimes, to winne vs to our harme,
2 305 The Instruments of Darknesse tell vs Truths,
2 306 Winne vs with honest Trifles, to betray's
2 307 In deepest consequence.
2 308 Cousins, a word, I pray you
2 309 
2 310    Macb. Two Truths are told,
2 311 As happy Prologues to the swelling Act
2 312 Of the Imperiall Theame. I thanke you Gentlemen:
2 313 This supernaturall solliciting
2 314 Cannot be ill; cannot be good.
2 315 If ill? why hath it giuen me earnest of successe,
2 316 Commencing in a Truth? I am Thane of Cawdor.
2 317 If good? why doe I yeeld to that suggestion,
2 318 Whose horrid Image doth vnfixe my Heire,
2 319 And make my seated Heart knock at my Ribbes,
2 320 Against the vse of Nature? Present Feares
2 321 Are lesse then horrible Imaginings:
2 322 My Thought, whose Murther yet is but fantasticall,
2 323 Shakes so my single state of Man,
2 324 That Function is smother'd in surmise,
2 325 And nothing is, but what is not
2 326 
2 327    Banq. Looke how our Partner's rapt
2 328 
2 329    Macb. If Chance will haue me King,
2 330 Why Chance may Crowne me,
2 331 Without my stirre
2 332 
2 333    Banq. New Honors come vpon him
2 334 Like our strange Garments, cleaue not to their mould,
2 335 But with the aid of vse
2 336 
2 337    Macb. Come what come may,
2 338 Time, and the Houre, runs through the roughest Day
2 339 
2 340    Banq. Worthy Macbeth, wee stay vpon your leysure
2 341 
2 342    Macb. Giue me your fauour:
2 343 My dull Braine was wrought with things forgotten.
2 344 Kinde Gentlemen, your paines are registred,
2 345 Where euery day I turne the Leafe,
2 346 To reade them.
2 347 Let vs toward the King: thinke vpon
2 348 What hath chanc'd: and at more time,
2 349 The Interim hauing weigh'd it, let vs speake
2 350 Our free Hearts each to other
2 351 
2 352    Banq. Very gladly
2 353 
2 354    Macb. Till then enough:
2 355 Come friends.
2 356 
2 357 Exeunt.
2 358 
2 359 
2 360 Scena Quarta.
2 361 
2 362 Flourish. Enter King, Lenox, Malcolme, Donalbaine, and
2 363 Attendants.
2 364 
2 365   King. Is execution done on Cawdor?
2 366 Or not those in Commission yet return'd?
2 367   Mal. My Liege, they are not yet come back.
2 368 But I haue spoke with one that saw him die:
2 369 Who did report, that very frankly hee
2 370 Confess'd his Treasons, implor'd your Highnesse Pardon,
2 371 And set forth a deepe Repentance:
2 372 Nothing in his Life became him,
2 373 Like the leauing it. Hee dy'de,
2 374 As one that had beene studied in his death,
2 375 To throw away the dearest thing he ow'd,
2 376 As 'twere a carelesse Trifle
2 377 
2 378    King. There's no Art,
2 379 To finde the Mindes construction in the Face.
2 380 He was a Gentleman, on whom I built
2 381 An absolute Trust.
2 382 Enter Macbeth, Banquo, Rosse, and Angus.
2 383 
2 384 O worthyest Cousin,
2 385 The sinne of my Ingratitude euen now
2 386 Was heauie on me. Thou art so farre before,
2 387 That swiftest Wing of Recompence is slow,
2 388 To ouertake thee. Would thou hadst lesse deseru'd,
2 389 That the proportion both of thanks, and payment,
2 390 Might haue beene mine: onely I haue left to say,
2 391 More is thy due, then more then all can pay
2 392 
2 393    Macb. The seruice, and the loyaltie I owe,
2 394 In doing it, payes it selfe.
2 395 Your Highnesse part, is to receiue our Duties:
2 396 And our Duties are to your Throne, and State,
2 397 Children, and Seruants; which doe but what they should,
2 398 By doing euery thing safe toward your Loue
2 399 And Honor
2 400 
2 401    King. Welcome hither:
2 402 I haue begun to plant thee, and will labour
2 403 To make thee full of growing. Noble Banquo,
2 404 That hast no lesse deseru'd, nor must be knowne
2 405 No lesse to haue done so: Let me enfold thee,
2 406 And hold thee to my Heart
2 407 
2 408    Banq. There if I grow,
2 409 The Haruest is your owne
2 410 
2 411    King. My plenteous Ioyes,
2 412 Wanton in fulnesse, seeke to hide themselues
2 413 In drops of sorrow. Sonnes, Kinsmen, Thanes,
2 414 And you whose places are the nearest, know,
2 415 We will establish our Estate vpon
2 416 Our eldest, Malcolme, whom we name hereafter,
2 417 The Prince of Cumberland: which Honor must
2 418 Not vnaccompanied, inuest him onely,
2 419 But signes of Noblenesse, like Starres, shall shine
2 420 On all deseruers. From hence to Envernes,
2 421 And binde vs further to you
2 422 
2 423    Macb. The Rest is Labor, which is not vs'd for you:
2 424 Ile be my selfe the Herbenger, and make ioyfull
2 425 The hearing of my Wife, with your approach:
2 426 So humbly take my leaue
2 427 
2 428    King. My worthy Cawdor
2 429 
2 430    Macb. The Prince of Cumberland: that is a step,
2 431 On which I must fall downe, or else o're-leape,
2 432 For in my way it lyes. Starres hide your fires,
2 433 Let not Light see my black and deepe desires:
2 434 The Eye winke at the Hand: yet let that bee,
2 435 Which the Eye feares, when it is done to see.
2 436 Enter.
2 437 
2 438   King. True worthy Banquo: he is full so valiant,
2 439 And in his commendations, I am fed:
2 440 It is a Banquet to me. Let's after him,
2 441 Whose care is gone before, to bid vs welcome:
2 442 It is a peerelesse Kinsman.
2 443 
2 444 Flourish. Exeunt.
2 445 
2 446 
2 447 Scena Quinta.
2 448 
2 449 Enter Macbeths Wife alone with a Letter.
2 450 
2 451   Lady. They met me in the day of successe: and I haue
2 452 learn'd by the perfect'st report, they haue more in them, then
2 453 mortall knowledge. When I burnt in desire to question them
2 454 further, they made themselues Ayre, into which they vanish'd.
2 455 Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came Missiues from
2 456 the King, who all-hail'd me Thane of Cawdor, by which Title
2 457 before, these weyward Sisters saluted me, and referr'd me to
2 458 the comming on of time, with haile King that shalt be. This
2 459 haue I thought good to deliuer thee (my dearest Partner of
2 460 Greatnesse) that thou might'st not loose the dues of reioycing
2 461 by being ignorant of what Greatnesse is promis'd thee. Lay
2 462 it to thy heart and farewell.
2 463 Glamys thou art, and Cawdor, and shalt be
2 464 What thou art promis'd: yet doe I feare thy Nature,
2 465 It is too full o'th' Milke of humane kindnesse,
2 466 To catch the neerest way. Thou would'st be great,
2 467 Art not without Ambition, but without
2 468 The illnesse should attend it. What thou would'st highly,
2 469 That would'st thou holily: would'st not play false,
2 470 And yet would'st wrongly winne.
2 471 Thould'st haue, great Glamys, that which cryes,
2 472 Thus thou must doe, if thou haue it;
2 473 And that which rather thou do'st feare to doe,
2 474 Then wishest should be vndone. High thee hither,
2 475 That I may powre my Spirits in thine Eare,
2 476 And chastise with the valour of my Tongue
2 477 All that impeides thee from the Golden Round,
2 478 Which Fate and Metaphysicall ayde doth seeme
2 479 To haue thee crown'd withall.
2 480 Enter Messenger.
2 481 
2 482 What is your tidings?
2 483   Mess. The King comes here to Night
2 484 
2 485    Lady. Thou'rt mad to say it.
2 486 Is not thy Master with him? who, wer't so,
2 487 Would haue inform'd for preparation
2 488 
2 489    Mess. So please you, it is true: our Thane is comming:
2 490 One of my fellowes had the speed of him;
2 491 Who almost dead for breath, had scarcely more
2 492 Then would make vp his Message
2 493 
2 494    Lady. Giue him tending,
2 495 He brings great newes,
2 496 
2 497 Exit Messenger.
2 498 
2 499 The Rauen himselfe is hoarse,
2 500 That croakes the fatall entrance of Duncan
2 501 Vnder my Battlements. Come you Spirits,
2 502 That tend on mortall thoughts, vnsex me here,
2 503 And fill me from the Crowne to the Toe, top-full
2 504 Of direst Crueltie: make thick my blood,
2 505 Stop vp th' accesse, and passage to Remorse,
2 506 That no compunctious visitings of Nature
2 507 Shake my fell purpose, nor keepe peace betweene
2 508 Th' effect, and hit. Come to my Womans Brests,
2 509 And take my Milke for Gall, you murth'ring Ministers,
2 510 Where-euer, in your sightlesse substances,
2 511 You wait on Natures Mischiefe. Come thick Night,
2 512 And pall thee in the dunnest smoake of Hell,
2 513 
2 514 That my keene Knife see not the Wound it makes,
2 515 Nor Heauen peepe through the Blanket of the darke,
2 516 To cry, hold, hold.
2 517 Enter Macbeth.
2 518 
2 519 Great Glamys, worthy Cawdor,
2 520 Greater then both, by the all-haile hereafter,
2 521 Thy Letters haue transported me beyond
2 522 This ignorant present, and I feele now
2 523 The future in the instant
2 524 
2 525    Macb. My dearest Loue,
2 526 Duncan comes here to Night
2 527 
2 528    Lady. And when goes hence?
2 529   Macb. To morrow, as he purposes
2 530 
2 531    Lady. O neuer,
2 532 Shall Sunne that Morrow see.
2 533 Your Face, my Thane, is as a Booke, where men
2 534 May reade strange matters, to beguile the time.
2 535 Looke like the time, beare welcome in your Eye,
2 536 Your Hand, your Tongue: looke like th' innocent flower,
2 537 But be the Serpent vnder't. He that's comming,
2 538 Must be prouided for: and you shall put
2 539 This Nights great Businesse into my dispatch,
2 540 Which shall to all our Nights, and Dayes to come,
2 541 Giue solely soueraigne sway, and Masterdome
2 542 
2 543    Macb. We will speake further,
2 544   Lady. Onely looke vp cleare:
2 545 To alter fauor, euer is to feare:
2 546 Leaue all the rest to me.
2 547 
2 548 Exeunt.
2 549 
2 550 
2 551 Scena Sexta.
2 552 
2 553 Hoboyes, and Torches. Enter King, Malcolme, Donalbaine,
2 554 Banquo, Lenox,
2 555 Macduff, Rosse, Angus, and Attendants.
2 556 
2 557   King. This Castle hath a pleasant seat,
2 558 The ayre nimbly and sweetly recommends it selfe
2 559 Vnto our gentle sences
2 560 
2 561    Banq. This Guest of Summer,
2 562 The Temple-haunting Barlet does approue,
2 563 By his loued Mansonry, that the Heauens breath
2 564 Smells wooingly here: no Iutty frieze,
2 565 Buttrice, nor Coigne of Vantage, but this Bird
2 566 Hath made his pendant Bed, and procreant Cradle,
2 567 Where they must breed, and haunt: I haue obseru'd
2 568 The ayre is delicate.
2 569 Enter Lady.
2 570 
2 571   King. See, see our honor'd Hostesse:
2 572 The Loue that followes vs, sometime is our trouble,
2 573 Which still we thanke as Loue. Herein I teach you,
2 574 How you shall bid God-eyld vs for your paines,
2 575 And thanke vs for your trouble
2 576 
2 577    Lady. All our seruice,
2 578 In euery point twice done, and then done double,
2 579 Were poore, and single Businesse, to contend
2 580 Against those Honors deepe, and broad,
2 581 Wherewith your Maiestie loades our House:
2 582 For those of old, and the late Dignities,
2 583 Heap'd vp to them, we rest your Ermites
2 584 
2 585    King. Where's the Thane of Cawdor?
2 586 We courst him at the heeles, and had a purpose
2 587 To be his Purueyor: But he rides well,
2 588 And his great Loue (sharpe as his Spurre) hath holp him
2 589 To his home before vs: Faire and Noble Hostesse
2 590 We are your guest to night
2 591 
2 592    La. Your Seruants euer,
2 593 Haue theirs, themselues, and what is theirs in compt,
2 594 To make their Audit at your Highnesse pleasure,
2 595 Still to returne your owne
2 596 
2 597    King. Giue me your hand:
2 598 Conduct me to mine Host we loue him highly,
2 599 And shall continue, our Graces towards him.
2 600 By your leaue Hostesse.
2 601 
2 602 Exeunt.
2 603 
2 604 Scena Septima.
2 605 
2 606 Hoboyes. Torches. Enter a Sewer, and diuers Seruants with Dishes
2 607 and
2 608 Seruice ouer the Stage. Then enter Macbeth
2 609 
2 610    Macb. If it were done, when 'tis done, then 'twer well,
2 611 It were done quickly: If th' Assassination
2 612 Could trammell vp the Consequence, and catch
2 613 With his surcease, Successe: that but this blow
2 614 Might be the be all, and the end all. Heere,
2 615 But heere, vpon this Banke and Schoole of time,
2 616 Wee'ld iumpe the life to come. But in these Cases,
2 617 We still haue iudgement heere, that we but teach
2 618 Bloody Instructions, which being taught, returne
2 619 To plague th' Inuenter, this euen-handed Iustice
2 620 Commends th' Ingredience of our poyson'd Challice
2 621 To our owne lips. Hee's heere in double trust;
2 622 First, as I am his Kinsman, and his Subiect,
2 623 Strong both against the Deed: Then, as his Host,
2 624 Who should against his Murtherer shut the doore,
2 625 Not beare the knife my selfe. Besides, this Duncane
2 626 Hath borne his Faculties so meeke; hath bin
2 627 So cleere in his great Office, that his Vertues
2 628 Will pleade like Angels, Trumpet-tongu'd against
2 629 The deepe damnation of his taking off:
2 630 And Pitty, like a naked New-borne-Babe,
2 631 Striding the blast, or Heauens Cherubin, hors'd
2 632 Vpon the sightlesse Curriors of the Ayre,
2 633 Shall blow the horrid deed in euery eye,
2 634 That teares shall drowne the winde. I haue no Spurre
2 635 To pricke the sides of my intent, but onely
2 636 Vaulting Ambition, which ore-leapes it selfe,
2 637 And falles on th' other.
2 638 Enter Lady.
2 639 
2 640 How now? What Newes?
2 641   La. He has almost supt: why haue you left the chamber?
2 642   Mac. Hath he ask'd for me?
2 643   La. Know you not, he ha's?
2 644   Mac. We will proceed no further in this Businesse:
2 645 He hath Honour'd me of late, and I haue bought
2 646 Golden Opinions from all sorts of people,
2 647 Which would be worne now in their newest glosse,
2 648 Not cast aside so soone
2 649 
2 650    La. Was the hope drunke,
2 651 Wherein you drest your selfe? Hath it slept since?
2 652 And wakes it now to looke so greene, and pale,
2 653 At what it did so freely? From this time,
2 654 Such I account thy loue. Art thou affear'd
2 655 To be the same in thine owne Act, and Valour,
2 656 As thou art in desire? Would'st thou haue that
2 657 Which thou esteem'st the Ornament of Life,
2 658 And liue a Coward in thine owne Esteeme?
2 659 Letting I dare not, wait vpon I would,
2 660 Like the poore Cat i'th' Addage
2 661 
2 662    Macb. Prythee peace:
2 663 I dare do all that may become a man,
2 664 Who dares do more, is none
2 665 
2 666    La. What Beast was't then
2 667 That made you breake this enterprize to me?
2 668 When you durst do it, then you were a man:
2 669 And to be more then what you were, you would
2 670 Be so much more the man. Nor time, nor place
2 671 Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:
2 672 They haue made themselues, and that their fitnesse now
2 673 Do's vnmake you. I haue giuen Sucke, and know
2 674 How tender 'tis to loue the Babe that milkes me,
2 675 I would, while it was smyling in my Face,
2 676 Haue pluckt my Nipple from his Bonelesse Gummes,
2 677 And dasht the Braines out, had I so sworne
2 678 As you haue done to this
2 679 
2 680    Macb. If we should faile?
2 681   Lady. We faile?
2 682 But screw your courage to the sticking place,
2 683 And wee'le not fayle: when Duncan is asleepe,
2 684 (Whereto the rather shall his dayes hard Iourney
2 685 Soundly inuite him) his two Chamberlaines
2 686 Will I with Wine, and Wassell, so conuince,
2 687 That Memorie, the Warder of the Braine,
2 688 Shall be a Fume, and the Receit of Reason
2 689 A Lymbeck onely: when in Swinish sleepe,
2 690 Their drenched Natures lyes as in a Death,
2 691 What cannot you and I performe vpon
2 692 Th' vnguarded Duncan? What not put vpon
2 693 His spungie Officers? who shall beare the guilt
2 694 Of our great quell
2 695 
2 696    Macb. Bring forth Men-Children onely:
2 697 For thy vndaunted Mettle should compose
2 698 Nothing but Males. Will it not be receiu'd,
2 699 When we haue mark'd with blood those sleepie two
2 700 Of his owne Chamber, and vs'd their very Daggers,
2 701 That they haue don't?
2 702   Lady. Who dares receiue it other,
2 703 As we shall make our Griefes and Clamor rore,
2 704 Vpon his Death?
2 705   Macb. I am settled, and bend vp
2 706 Each corporall Agent to this terrible Feat.
2 707 Away, and mock the time with fairest show,
2 708 False Face must hide what the false Heart doth know.
2 709 
2 710 Exeunt.
2 711 
2 712 
2 713 Actus Secundus. Scena Prima.
2 714 
2 715 Enter Banquo, and Fleance, with a Torch before him.
2 716 
2 717   Banq. How goes the Night, Boy?
2 718   Fleance. The Moone is downe: I haue not heard the
2 719 Clock
2 720 
2 721    Banq. And she goes downe at Twelue
2 722 
2 723    Fleance. I take't, 'tis later, Sir
2 724 
2 725    Banq. Hold, take my Sword:
2 726 There's Husbandry in Heauen,
2 727 Their Candles are all out: take thee that too.
2 728 A heauie Summons lyes like Lead vpon me,
2 729 And yet I would not sleepe:
2 730 Mercifull Powers, restraine in me the cursed thoughts
2 731 That Nature giues way to in repose.
2 732 Enter Macbeth, and a Seruant with a Torch.
2 733 
2 734 Giue me my Sword: who's there?
2 735   Macb. A Friend
2 736 
2 737    Banq. What Sir, not yet at rest? the King's a bed.
2 738 He hath beene in vnusuall Pleasure,
2 739 And sent forth great Largesse to your Offices.
2 740 This Diamond he greetes your Wife withall,
2 741 By the name of most kind Hostesse,
2 742 And shut vp in measurelesse content
2 743 
2 744    Mac. Being vnprepar'd,
2 745 Our will became the seruant to defect,
2 746 Which else should free haue wrought
2 747 
2 748    Banq. All's well.
2 749 I dreamt last Night of the three weyward Sisters:
2 750 To you they haue shew'd some truth
2 751 
2 752    Macb. I thinke not of them:
2 753 Yet when we can entreat an houre to serue,
2 754 We would spend it in some words vpon that Businesse,
2 755 If you would graunt the time
2 756 
2 757    Banq. At your kind'st leysure
2 758 
2 759    Macb. If you shall cleaue to my consent,
2 760 When 'tis, it shall make Honor for you
2 761 
2 762    Banq. So I lose none,
2 763 In seeking to augment it, but still keepe
2 764 My Bosome franchis'd, and Allegeance cleare,
2 765 I shall be counsail'd
2 766 
2 767    Macb. Good repose the while
2 768 
2 769    Banq. Thankes Sir: the like to you.
2 770 
2 771 Exit Banquo.
2 772 
2 773   Macb. Goe bid thy Mistresse, when my drinke is ready,
2 774 She strike vpon the Bell. Get thee to bed.
2 775 Enter.
2 776 
2 777 Is this a Dagger, which I see before me,
2 778 The Handle toward my Hand? Come, let me clutch thee:
2 779 I haue thee not, and yet I see thee still.
2 780 Art thou not fatall Vision, sensible
2 781 To feeling, as to sight? or art thou but
2 782 A Dagger of the Minde, a false Creation,
2 783 Proceeding from the heat-oppressed Braine?
2 784 I see thee yet, in forme as palpable,
2 785 As this which now I draw.
2 786 Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going,
2 787 And such an Instrument I was to vse.
2 788 Mine Eyes are made the fooles o'th' other Sences,
2 789 Or else worth all the rest: I see thee still;
2 790 And on thy Blade, and Dudgeon, Gouts of Blood,
2 791 Which was not so before. There's no such thing:
2 792 It is the bloody Businesse, which informes
2 793 Thus to mine Eyes. Now o're the one halfe World
2 794 Nature seemes dead, and wicked Dreames abuse
2 795 The Curtain'd sleepe: Witchcraft celebrates
2 796 Pale Heccats Offrings: and wither'd Murther,
2 797 Alarum'd by his Centinell, the Wolfe,
2 798 Whose howle's his Watch, thus with his stealthy pace,
2 799 With Tarquins rauishing sides, towards his designe
2 800 Moues like a Ghost. Thou sowre and firme-set Earth
2 801 Heare not my steps, which they may walke, for feare
2 802 Thy very stones prate of my where-about,
2 803 And take the present horror from the time,
2 804 Which now sutes with it. Whiles I threat, he liues:
2 805 Words to the heat of deedes too cold breath giues.
2 806 
2 807 A Bell rings.
2 808 
2 809 I goe, and it is done: the Bell inuites me.
2 810 Heare it not, Duncan, for it is a Knell,
2 811 That summons thee to Heauen, or to Hell.
2 812 Enter.
2 813 
2 814 
2 815 Scena Secunda.
2 816 
2 817 Enter Lady.
2 818 
2 819   La. That which hath made the[m] drunk, hath made me bold:
2 820 What hath quench'd them, hath giuen me fire.
2 821 Hearke, peace: it was the Owle that shriek'd,
2 822 The fatall Bell-man, which giues the stern'st good-night.
2 823 He is about it, the Doores are open:
2 824 And the surfeted Groomes doe mock their charge
2 825 With Snores. I haue drugg'd their Possets,
2 826 That Death and Nature doe contend about them,
2 827 Whether they liue, or dye.
2 828 Enter Macbeth.
2 829 
2 830   Macb. Who's there? what hoa?
2 831   Lady. Alack, I am afraid they haue awak'd,
2 832 And 'tis not done: th' attempt, and not the deed,
2 833 Confounds vs: hearke: I lay'd their Daggers ready,
2 834 He could not misse 'em. Had he not resembled
2 835 My Father as he slept, I had don't.
2 836 My Husband?
2 837   Macb. I haue done the deed:
2 838 Didst thou not heare a noyse?
2 839   Lady. I heard the Owle schreame, and the Crickets cry.
2 840 Did not you speake?
2 841   Macb. When?
2 842   Lady. Now
2 843 
2 844    Macb. As I descended?
2 845   Lady. I
2 846 
2 847    Macb. Hearke, who lyes i'th' second Chamber?
2 848   Lady. Donalbaine
2 849 
2 850    Mac. This is a sorry sight
2 851 
2 852    Lady. A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight
2 853 
2 854    Macb. There's one did laugh in's sleepe,
2 855 And one cry'd Murther, that they did wake each other:
2 856 I stood, and heard them: But they did say their Prayers,
2 857 And addrest them againe to sleepe
2 858 
2 859    Lady. There are two lodg'd together
2 860 
2 861    Macb. One cry'd God blesse vs, and Amen the other,
2 862 As they had seene me with these Hangmans hands:
2 863 Listning their feare, I could not say Amen,
2 864 When they did say God blesse vs
2 865 
2 866    Lady. Consider it not so deepely
2 867 
2 868    Mac. But wherefore could not I pronounce Amen?
2 869 I had most need of Blessing, and Amen stuck in my throat
2 870 
2 871    Lady. These deeds must not be thought
2 872 After these wayes: so, it will make vs mad
2 873 
2 874    Macb. Me thought I heard a voyce cry, Sleep no more:
2 875 Macbeth does murther Sleepe, the innocent Sleepe,
2 876 Sleepe that knits vp the rauel'd Sleeue of Care,
2 877 The death of each dayes Life, sore Labors Bath,
2 878 Balme of hurt Mindes, great Natures second Course,
2 879 Chiefe nourisher in Life's Feast
2 880 
2 881    Lady. What doe you meane?
2 882   Macb. Still it cry'd, Sleepe no more to all the House:
2 883 Glamis hath murther'd Sleepe, and therefore Cawdor
2 884 Shall sleepe no more: Macbeth shall sleepe no more
2 885 
2 886    Lady. Who was it, that thus cry'd? why worthy Thane,
2 887 You doe vnbend your Noble strength, to thinke
2 888 So braine-sickly of things: Goe get some Water,
2 889 And wash this filthie Witnesse from your Hand.
2 890 Why did you bring these Daggers from the place?
2 891 They must lye there: goe carry them, and smeare
2 892 The sleepie Groomes with blood
2 893 
2 894    Macb. Ile goe no more:
2 895 I am afraid, to thinke what I haue done:
2 896 Looke on't againe, I dare not
2 897 
2 898    Lady. Infirme of purpose:
2 899 Giue me the Daggers: the sleeping, and the dead,
2 900 Are but as Pictures: 'tis the Eye of Childhood,
2 901 That feares a painted Deuill. If he doe bleed,
2 902 Ile guild the Faces of the Groomes withall,
2 903 For it must seeme their Guilt.
2 904 Enter.
2 905 
2 906 Knocke within.
2 907 
2 908   Macb. Whence is that knocking?
2 909 How is't with me, when euery noyse appalls me?
2 910 What Hands are here? hah: they pluck out mine Eyes.
2 911 Will all great Neptunes Ocean wash this blood
2 912 Cleane from my Hand? no: this my Hand will rather
2 913 The multitudinous Seas incarnardine,
2 914 Making the Greene one, Red.
2 915 Enter Lady.
2 916 
2 917   Lady. My Hands are of your colour: but I shame
2 918 To weare a Heart so white.
2 919 
2 920 Knocke.
2 921 
2 922 I heare a knocking at the South entry:
2 923 Retyre we to our Chamber:
2 924 A little Water cleares vs of this deed.
2 925 How easie is it then? your Constancie
2 926 Hath left you vnattended.
2 927 
2 928 Knocke.
2 929 
2 930 Hearke, more knocking.
2 931 Get on your Night-Gowne, least occasion call vs,
2 932 And shew vs to be Watchers: be not lost
2 933 So poorely in your thoughts
2 934 
2 935    Macb. To know my deed,
2 936 
2 937 Knocke.
2 938 
2 939 'Twere best not know my selfe.
2 940 Wake Duncan with thy knocking:
2 941 I would thou could'st.
2 942 
2 943 Exeunt.
2 944 
2 945 
2 946 Scena Tertia.
2 947 
2 948 Enter a Porter. Knocking within.
2 949 
2 950   Porter. Here's a knocking indeede: if a man were
2 951 Porter of Hell Gate, hee should haue old turning the
2 952 Key.
2 953 
2 954 Knock.
2 955 
2 956 Knock, Knock, Knock. Who's there
2 957 i'th' name of Belzebub? Here's a Farmer, that hang'd
2 958 himselfe on th' expectation of Plentie: Come in time, haue
2 959 Napkins enow about you, here you'le sweat for't.
2 960 
2 961 Knock.
2 962 
2 963 Knock, knock. Who's there in th' other Deuils Name?
2 964 Faith here's an Equiuocator, that could sweare in both
2 965 the Scales against eyther Scale, who committed Treason
2 966 enough for Gods sake, yet could not equiuocate to Heauen:
2 967 oh come in, Equiuocator.
2 968 
2 969 Knock.
2 970 
2 971 Knock, Knock, Knock. Who's there? 'Faith here's an English
2 972 Taylor come hither, for stealing out of a French Hose:
2 973 Come in Taylor, here you may rost your Goose.
2 974 Knock.
2 975 
2 976 Knock, Knock. Neuer at quiet: What are you? but this
2 977 place is too cold for Hell. Ile Deuill-Porter it no further:
2 978 I had thought to haue let in some of all Professions, that
2 979 goe the Primrose way to th' euerlasting Bonfire.
2 980 
2 981 Knock.
2 982 
2 983 Anon, anon, I pray you remember the Porter.
2 984 Enter Macduff, and Lenox.
2 985 
2 986   Macd. Was it so late, friend, ere you went to Bed,
2 987 That you doe lye so late?
2 988   Port. Faith Sir, we were carowsing till the second Cock:
2 989 And Drinke, Sir, is a great prouoker of three things
2 990 
2 991    Macd. What three things does Drinke especially
2 992 prouoke?
2 993   Port. Marry, Sir, Nose-painting, Sleepe, and Vrine.
2 994 Lecherie, Sir, it prouokes, and vnprouokes: it prouokes
2 995 the desire, but it takes away the performance. Therefore
2 996 much Drinke may be said to be an Equiuocator with Lecherie:
2 997 it makes him, and it marres him; it sets him on,
2 998 and it takes him off; it perswades him, and dis-heartens
2 999 him; makes him stand too, and not stand too: in conclusion,
2 1000 equiuocates him in a sleepe, and giuing him the Lye,
2 1001 leaues him
2 1002 
2 1003    Macd. I beleeue, Drinke gaue thee the Lye last Night
2 1004 
2 1005    Port. That it did, Sir, i'the very Throat on me: but I
2 1006 requited him for his Lye, and (I thinke) being too strong
2 1007 for him, though he tooke vp my Legges sometime, yet I
2 1008 made a Shift to cast him.
2 1009 Enter Macbeth.
2 1010 
2 1011   Macd. Is thy Master stirring?
2 1012 Our knocking ha's awak'd him: here he comes
2 1013 
2 1014    Lenox. Good morrow, Noble Sir
2 1015 
2 1016    Macb. Good morrow both
2 1017 
2 1018    Macd. Is the King stirring, worthy Thane?
2 1019   Macb. Not yet
2 1020 
2 1021    Macd. He did command me to call timely on him,
2 1022 I haue almost slipt the houre
2 1023 
2 1024    Macb. Ile bring you to him
2 1025 
2 1026    Macd. I know this is a ioyfull trouble to you:
2 1027 But yet 'tis one
2 1028 
2 1029    Macb. The labour we delight in, Physicks paine:
2 1030 This is the Doore
2 1031 
2 1032    Macd. Ile make so bold to call, for 'tis my limitted
2 1033 seruice.
2 1034 
2 1035 Exit Macduffe.
2 1036 
2 1037   Lenox. Goes the King hence to day?
2 1038   Macb. He does: he did appoint so
2 1039 
2 1040    Lenox. The Night ha's been vnruly:
2 1041 Where we lay, our Chimneys were blowne downe,
2 1042 And (as they say) lamentings heard i'th' Ayre;
2 1043 Strange Schreemes of Death,
2 1044 And Prophecying, with Accents terrible,
2 1045 Of dyre Combustion, and confus'd Euents,
2 1046 New hatch'd toth' wofull time.
2 1047 The obscure Bird clamor'd the liue-long Night.
2 1048 Some say, the Earth was Feuorous,
2 1049 And did shake
2 1050 
2 1051    Macb. 'Twas a rough Night
2 1052 
2 1053    Lenox. My young remembrance cannot paralell
2 1054 A fellow to it.
2 1055 Enter Macduff.
2 1056 
2 1057   Macd. O horror, horror, horror,
2 1058 Tongue nor Heart cannot conceiue, nor name thee
2 1059 
2 1060    Macb. and Lenox. What's the matter?
2 1061   Macd. Confusion now hath made his Master-peece:
2 1062 Most sacrilegious Murther hath broke ope
2 1063 The Lords anoynted Temple, and stole thence
2 1064 The Life o'th' Building
2 1065 
2 1066    Macb. What is't you say, the Life?
2 1067   Lenox. Meane you his Maiestie?
2 1068   Macd. Approch the Chamber, and destroy your sight
2 1069 With a new Gorgon. Doe not bid me speake:
2 1070 See, and then speake your selues: awake, awake,
2 1071 
2 1072 Exeunt. Macbeth and Lenox.
2 1073 
2 1074 Ring the Alarum Bell: Murther, and Treason,
2 1075 Banquo, and Donalbaine: Malcolme awake,
2 1076 Shake off this Downey sleepe, Deaths counterfeit,
2 1077 And looke on Death it selfe: vp, vp, and see
2 1078 The great Doomes Image: Malcolme, Banquo,
2 1079 As from your Graues rise vp, and walke like Sprights,
2 1080 To countenance this horror. Ring the Bell.
2 1081 
2 1082 Bell rings. Enter Lady.
2 1083 
2 1084   Lady. What's the Businesse?
2 1085 That such a hideous Trumpet calls to parley
2 1086 The sleepers of the House? speake, speake
2 1087 
2 1088    Macd. O gentle Lady,
2 1089 'Tis not for you to heare what I can speake:
2 1090 The repetition in a Womans eare,
2 1091 Would murther as it fell.
2 1092 Enter Banquo.
2 1093 
2 1094 O Banquo, Banquo, Our Royall Master's murther'd
2 1095 
2 1096    Lady. Woe, alas:
2 1097 What, in our House?
2 1098   Ban. Too cruell, any where.
2 1099 Deare Duff, I prythee contradict thy selfe,
2 1100 And say, it is not so.
2 1101 Enter Macbeth, Lenox, and Rosse.
2 1102 
2 1103   Macb. Had I but dy'd an houre before this chance,
2 1104 I had liu'd a blessed time: for from this instant,
2 1105 There's nothing serious in Mortalitie:
2 1106 All is but Toyes: Renowne and Grace is dead,
2 1107 The Wine of Life is drawne, and the meere Lees
2 1108 Is left this Vault, to brag of.
2 1109 Enter Malcolme and Donalbaine.
2 1110 
2 1111   Donal. What is amisse?
2 1112   Macb. You are, and doe not know't:
2 1113 The Spring, the Head, the Fountaine of your Blood
2 1114 Is stopt, the very Source of it is stopt
2 1115 
2 1116    Macd. Your Royall Father's murther'd
2 1117 
2 1118    Mal. Oh, by whom?
2 1119   Lenox. Those of his Chamber, as it seem'd, had don't:
2 1120 Their Hands and Faces were all badg'd with blood,
2 1121 So were their Daggers, which vnwip'd, we found
2 1122 Vpon their Pillowes: they star'd, and were distracted,
2 1123 No mans Life was to be trusted with them
2 1124 
2 1125    Macb. O, yet I doe repent me of my furie,
2 1126 That I did kill them
2 1127 
2 1128    Macd. Wherefore did you so?
2 1129   Macb. Who can be wise, amaz'd, temp'rate, & furious,
2 1130 Loyall, and Neutrall, in a moment? No man:
2 1131 Th' expedition of my violent Loue
2 1132 Out-run the pawser, Reason. Here lay Duncan,
2 1133 His Siluer skinne, lac'd with His Golden Blood,
2 1134 And his gash'd Stabs, look'd like a Breach in Nature,
2 1135 For Ruines wastfull entrance: there the Murtherers,
2 1136 Steep'd in the Colours of their Trade; their Daggers
2 1137 Vnmannerly breech'd with gore: who could refraine,
2 1138 That had a heart to loue; and in that heart,
2 1139 Courage, to make's loue knowne?
2 1140   Lady. Helpe me hence, hoa
2 1141 
2 1142    Macd. Looke to the Lady
2 1143 
2 1144    Mal. Why doe we hold our tongues,
2 1145 That most may clayme this argument for ours?
2 1146   Donal. What should be spoken here,
2 1147 Where our Fate hid in an augure hole,
2 1148 May rush, and seize vs? Let's away,
2 1149 Our Teares are not yet brew'd
2 1150 
2 1151    Mal. Nor our strong Sorrow
2 1152 Vpon the foot of Motion
2 1153 
2 1154    Banq. Looke to the Lady:
2 1155 And when we haue our naked Frailties hid,
2 1156 That suffer in exposure; let vs meet,
2 1157 And question this most bloody piece of worke,
2 1158 To know it further. Feares and scruples shake vs:
2 1159 In the great Hand of God I stand, and thence,
2 1160 Against the vndivulg'd pretence, I fight
2 1161 Of Treasonous Mallice
2 1162 
2 1163    Macd. And so doe I
2 1164 
2 1165    All. So all
2 1166 
2 1167    Macb. Let's briefely put on manly readinesse,
2 1168 And meet i'th' Hall together
2 1169 
2 1170    All. Well contented.
2 1171 
2 1172 Exeunt.
2 1173 
2 1174   Malc. What will you doe?
2 1175 Let's not consort with them:
2 1176 To shew an vnfelt Sorrow, is an Office
2 1177 Which the false man do's easie.
2 1178 Ile to England
2 1179 
2 1180    Don. To Ireland, I:
2 1181 Our seperated fortune shall keepe vs both the safer:
2 1182 Where we are, there's Daggers in mens smiles;
2 1183 The neere in blood, the neerer bloody
2 1184 
2 1185    Malc. This murtherous Shaft that's shot,
2 1186 Hath not yet lighted: and our safest way,
2 1187 Is to auoid the ayme. Therefore to Horse,
2 1188 And let vs not be daintie of leaue-taking,
2 1189 But shift away: there's warrant in that Theft,
2 1190 Which steales it selfe, when there's no mercie left.
2 1191 
2 1192 Exeunt.
2 1193 
2 1194 
2 1195 
2 1196 Scena Quarta.
2 1197 
2 1198 Enter Rosse, with an Old man.
2 1199 
2 1200   Old man. Threescore and ten I can remember well,
2 1201 Within the Volume of which Time, I haue seene
2 1202 Houres dreadfull, and things strange: but this sore Night
2 1203 Hath trifled former knowings
2 1204 
2 1205    Rosse. Ha, good Father,
2 1206 Thou seest the Heauens, as troubled with mans Act,
2 1207 Threatens his bloody Stage: byth' Clock 'tis Day,
2 1208 And yet darke Night strangles the trauailing Lampe:
2 1209 Is't Nights predominance, or the Dayes shame,
2 1210 That Darknesse does the face of Earth intombe,
2 1211 When liuing Light should kisse it?
2 1212   Old man. 'Tis vnnaturall,
2 1213 Euen like the deed that's done: On Tuesday last,
2 1214 A Faulcon towring in her pride of place,
2 1215 Was by a Mowsing Owle hawkt at, and kill'd
2 1216 
2 1217    Rosse. And Duncans Horses,
2 1218 (A thing most strange, and certaine)
2 1219 Beauteous, and swift, the Minions of their Race,
2 1220 Turn'd wilde in nature, broke their stalls, flong out,
2 1221 Contending 'gainst Obedience, as they would
2 1222 Make Warre with Mankinde
2 1223 
2 1224    Old man. 'Tis said, they eate each other
2 1225 
2 1226    Rosse. They did so:
2 1227 To th' amazement of mine eyes that look'd vpon't.
2 1228 Enter Macduffe.
2 1229 
2 1230 Heere comes the good Macduffe.
2 1231 How goes the world Sir, now?
2 1232   Macd. Why see you not?
2 1233   Ross. Is't known who did this more then bloody deed?
2 1234   Macd. Those that Macbeth hath slaine
2 1235 
2 1236    Ross. Alas the day,
2 1237 What good could they pretend?
2 1238   Macd. They were subborned,
2 1239 Malcolme, and Donalbaine the Kings two Sonnes
2 1240 Are stolne away and fled, which puts vpon them
2 1241 Suspition of the deed
2 1242 
2 1243    Rosse. 'Gainst Nature still,
2 1244 Thriftlesse Ambition, that will rauen vp
2 1245 Thine owne liues meanes: Then 'tis most like,
2 1246 The Soueraignty will fall vpon Macbeth
2 1247 
2 1248    Macd. He is already nam'd, and gone to Scone
2 1249 To be inuested
2 1250 
2 1251    Rosse. Where is Duncans body?
2 1252   Macd. Carried to Colmekill,
2 1253 The Sacred Store-house of his Predecessors,
2 1254 And Guardian of their Bones
2 1255 
2 1256    Rosse. Will you to Scone?
2 1257   Macd. No Cosin, Ile to Fife
2 1258 
2 1259    Rosse. Well, I will thither
2 1260 
2 1261    Macd. Well may you see things wel done there: Adieu
2 1262 Least our old Robes sit easier then our new
2 1263 
2 1264    Rosse. Farewell, Father
2 1265 
2 1266    Old M. Gods benyson go with you, and with those
2 1267 That would make good of bad, and Friends of Foes.
2 1268 
2 1269 Exeunt. omnes
2 1270 
2 1271 Actus Tertius. Scena Prima.
2 1272 
2 1273 Enter Banquo.
2 1274 
2 1275   Banq. Thou hast it now, King, Cawdor, Glamis, all,
2 1276 As the weyard Women promis'd, and I feare
2 1277 Thou playd'st most fowly for't: yet it was saide
2 1278 It should not stand in thy Posterity,
2 1279 But that my selfe should be the Roote, and Father
2 1280 Of many Kings. If there come truth from them,
2 1281 As vpon thee Macbeth, their Speeches shine,
2 1282 Why by the verities on thee made good,
2 1283 May they not be my Oracles as well,
2 1284 And set me vp in hope. But hush, no more.
2 1285 
2 1286 Senit sounded. Enter Macbeth as King, Lady Lenox, Rosse, Lords,
2 1287 and
2 1288 Attendants.
2 1289 
2 1290   Macb. Heere's our chiefe Guest
2 1291 
2 1292    La. If he had beene forgotten,
2 1293 It had bene as a gap in our great Feast,
2 1294 And all-thing vnbecomming
2 1295 
2 1296    Macb. To night we hold a solemne Supper sir,
2 1297 And Ile request your presence
2 1298 
2 1299    Banq. Let your Highnesse
2 1300 Command vpon me, to the which my duties
2 1301 Are with a most indissoluble tye
2 1302 For euer knit
2 1303 
2 1304    Macb. Ride you this afternoone?
2 1305   Ban. I, my good Lord
2 1306 
2 1307    Macb. We should haue else desir'd your good aduice
2 1308 (Which still hath been both graue, and prosperous)
2 1309 In this dayes Councell: but wee'le take to morrow.
2 1310 Is't farre you ride?
2 1311   Ban. As farre, my Lord, as will fill vp the time
2 1312 'Twixt this, and Supper. Goe not my Horse the better,
2 1313 I must become a borrower of the Night,
2 1314 For a darke houre, or twaine
2 1315 
2 1316    Macb. Faile not our Feast
2 1317 
2 1318    Ban. My Lord, I will not
2 1319 
2 1320    Macb. We heare our bloody Cozens are bestow'd
2 1321 In England, and in Ireland, not confessing
2 1322 Their cruell Parricide, filling their hearers
2 1323 With strange inuention. But of that to morrow,
2 1324 When therewithall, we shall haue cause of State,
2 1325 Crauing vs ioyntly. Hye you to Horse:
2 1326 Adieu, till you returne at Night.
2 1327 Goes Fleance with you?
2 1328   Ban. I, my good Lord: our time does call vpon's
2 1329 
2 1330    Macb. I wish your Horses swift, and sure of foot:
2 1331 And so I doe commend you to their backs.
2 1332 Farwell.
2 1333 
2 1334 Exit Banquo.
2 1335 
2 1336 Let euery man be master of his time,
2 1337 Till seuen at Night, to make societie
2 1338 The sweeter welcome:
2 1339 We will keepe our selfe till Supper time alone:
2 1340 While then, God be with you.
2 1341 
2 1342 Exeunt. Lords.
2 1343 
2 1344 Sirrha, a word with you: Attend those men
2 1345 Our pleasure?
2 1346   Seruant. They are, my Lord, without the Pallace
2 1347 Gate
2 1348 
2 1349    Macb. Bring them before vs.
2 1350 
2 1351 Exit Seruant.
2 1352 
2 1353 To be thus, is nothing, but to be safely thus
2 1354 Our feares in Banquo sticke deepe,
2 1355 And in his Royaltie of Nature reignes that
2 1356 Which would be fear'd. 'Tis much he dares,
2 1357 And to that dauntlesse temper of his Minde,
2 1358 He hath a Wisdome, that doth guide his Valour,
2 1359 To act in safetie. There is none but he,
2 1360 Whose being I doe feare: and vnder him,
2 1361 My Genius is rebuk'd, as it is said
2 1362 Mark Anthonies was by Caesar. He chid the Sisters,
2 1363 When first they put the Name of King vpon me,
2 1364 And bad them speake to him. Then Prophet-like,
2 1365 They hayl'd him Father to a Line of Kings.
2 1366 Vpon my Head they plac'd a fruitlesse Crowne,
2 1367 And put a barren Scepter in my Gripe,
2 1368 Thence to be wrencht with an vnlineall Hand,
2 1369 No Sonne of mine succeeding: if't be so,
2 1370 For Banquo's Issue haue I fil'd my Minde,
2 1371 For them, the gracious Duncan haue I murther'd,
2 1372 Put Rancours in the Vessell of my Peace
2 1373 Onely for them, and mine eternall Iewell
2 1374 Giuen to the common Enemie of Man,
2 1375 To make them Kings, the Seedes of Banquo Kings.
2 1376 Rather then so, come Fate into the Lyst,
2 1377 And champion me to th' vtterance.
2 1378 Who's there?
2 1379 Enter Seruant, and two Murtherers.
2 1380 
2 1381 Now goe to the Doore, and stay there till we call.
2 1382 
2 1383 Exit Seruant.
2 1384 
2 1385 Was it not yesterday we spoke together?
2 1386   Murth. It was, so please your Highnesse
2 1387 
2 1388    Macb. Well then,
2 1389 Now haue you consider'd of my speeches:
2 1390 Know, that it was he, in the times past,
2 1391 Which held you so vnder fortune,
2 1392 Which you thought had been our innocent selfe.
2 1393 This I made good to you, in our last conference,
2 1394 Past in probation with you:
2 1395 How you were borne in hand, how crost:
2 1396 The Instruments: who wrought with them:
2 1397 And all things else, that might
2 1398 To halfe a Soule, and to a Notion craz'd,
2 1399 Say, Thus did Banquo
2 1400 
2 1401    1.Murth. You made it knowne to vs
2 1402 
2 1403    Macb. I did so:
2 1404 And went further, which is now
2 1405 Our point of second meeting.
2 1406 Doe you finde your patience so predominant,
2 1407 In your nature, that you can let this goe?
2 1408 Are you so Gospell'd, to pray for this good man,
2 1409 And for his Issue, whose heauie hand
2 1410 Hath bow'd you to the Graue, and begger'd
2 1411 Yours for euer?
2 1412   1.Murth. We are men, my Liege
2 1413 
2 1414    Macb. I, in the Catalogue ye goe for men,
2 1415 As Hounds, and Greyhounds, Mungrels, Spaniels, Curres,
2 1416 Showghes, Water-Rugs, and Demy-Wolues are clipt
2 1417 All by the Name of Dogges: the valued file
2 1418 Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,
2 1419 The House-keeper, the Hunter, euery one
2 1420 According to the gift, which bounteous Nature
2 1421 Hath in him clos'd: whereby he does receiue
2 1422 Particular addition, from the Bill,
2 1423 That writes them all alike: and so of men.
2 1424 Now, if you haue a station in the file,
2 1425 Not i'th' worst ranke of Manhood, say't,
2 1426 And I will put that Businesse in your Bosomes,
2 1427 Whose execution takes your Enemie off,
2 1428 Grapples you to the heart; and loue of vs,
2 1429 Who weare our Health but sickly in his Life,
2 1430 Which in his Death were perfect
2 1431 
2 1432    2.Murth. I am one, my Liege,
2 1433 Whom the vile Blowes and Buffets of the World
2 1434 Hath so incens'd, that I am recklesse what I doe,
2 1435 To spight the World
2 1436 
2 1437    1.Murth. And I another,
2 1438 So wearie with Disasters, tugg'd with Fortune,
2 1439 That I would set my Life on any Chance,
2 1440 To mend it, or be rid on't
2 1441 
2 1442    Macb. Both of you know Banquo was your Enemie
2 1443 
2 1444    Murth. True, my Lord
2 1445 
2 1446    Macb. So is he mine: and in such bloody distance,
2 1447 That euery minute of his being, thrusts
2 1448 Against my neer'st of Life: and though I could
2 1449 With bare-fac'd power sweepe him from my sight,
2 1450 And bid my will auouch it; yet I must not,
2 1451 For certaine friends that are both his, and mine,
2 1452 Whose loues I may not drop, but wayle his fall,
2 1453 Who I my selfe struck downe: and thence it is,
2 1454 That I to your assistance doe make loue,
2 1455 Masking the Businesse from the common Eye,
2 1456 For sundry weightie Reasons
2 1457 
2 1458    2.Murth. We shall, my Lord,
2 1459 Performe what you command vs
2 1460 
2 1461    1.Murth. Though our Liues-
2 1462   Macb. Your Spirits shine through you.
2 1463 Within this houre, at most,
2 1464 I will aduise you where to plant your selues,
2 1465 Acquaint you with the perfect Spy o'th' time,
2 1466 The moment on't, for't must be done to Night,
2 1467 And something from the Pallace: alwayes thought,
2 1468 That I require a clearenesse; and with him,
2 1469 To leaue no Rubs nor Botches in the Worke:
2 1470   Fleans , his Sonne, that keepes him companie,
2 1471 Whose absence is no lesse materiall to me,
2 1472 Then is his Fathers, must embrace the fate
2 1473 Of that darke houre: resolue your selues apart,
2 1474 Ile come to you anon
2 1475 
2 1476    Murth. We are resolu'd, my Lord
2 1477 
2 1478    Macb. Ile call vpon you straight: abide within,
2 1479 It is concluded: Banquo, thy Soules flight,
2 1480 If it finde Heauen, must finde it out to Night.
2 1481 
2 1482 Exeunt.
2 1483 
2 1484 
2 1485 Scena Secunda.
2 1486 
2 1487 Enter Macbeths Lady, and a Seruant.
2 1488 
2 1489   Lady. Is Banquo gone from Court?
2 1490   Seruant. I, Madame, but returnes againe to Night
2 1491 
2 1492    Lady. Say to the King, I would attend his leysure,
2 1493 For a few words
2 1494 
2 1495    Seruant. Madame, I will.
2 1496 Enter.
2 1497 
2 1498   Lady. Nought's had, all's spent.
2 1499 Where our desire is got without content:
2 1500 'Tis safer, to be that which we destroy,
2 1501 Then by destruction dwell in doubtfull ioy.
2 1502 Enter Macbeth.
2 1503 
2 1504 How now, my Lord, why doe you keepe alone?
2 1505 Of sorryest Fancies your Companions making,
2 1506 Vsing those Thoughts, which should indeed haue dy'd
2 1507 With them they thinke on: things without all remedie
2 1508 Should be without regard: what's done, is done
2 1509 
2 1510    Macb. We haue scorch'd the Snake, not kill'd it:
2 1511 Shee'le close, and be her selfe, whilest our poore Mallice
2 1512 Remaines in danger of her former Tooth.
2 1513 But let the frame of things dis-ioynt,
2 1514 Both the Worlds suffer,
2 1515 Ere we will eate our Meale in feare, and sleepe
2 1516 In the affliction of these terrible Dreames,
2 1517 That shake vs Nightly: Better be with the dead,
2 1518 Whom we, to gayne our peace, haue sent to peace,
2 1519 Then on the torture of the Minde to lye
2 1520 In restlesse extasie.
2 1521 Duncane is in his Graue:
2 1522 After Lifes fitfull Feuer, he sleepes well,
2 1523 Treason ha's done his worst: nor Steele, nor Poyson,
2 1524 Mallice domestique, forraine Leuie, nothing,
2 1525 Can touch him further
2 1526 
2 1527    Lady. Come on:
2 1528 Gentle my Lord, sleeke o're your rugged Lookes,
2 1529 Be bright and Iouiall among your Guests to Night
2 1530 
2 1531    Macb. So shall I Loue, and so I pray be you:
2 1532 Let your remembrance apply to Banquo,
2 1533 Present him Eminence, both with Eye and Tongue:
2 1534 Vnsafe the while, that wee must laue
2 1535 Our Honors in these flattering streames,
2 1536 And make our Faces Vizards to our Hearts,
2 1537 Disguising what they are
2 1538 
2 1539    Lady. You must leaue this
2 1540 
2 1541    Macb. O, full of Scorpions is my Minde, deare Wife:
2 1542 Thou know'st, that Banquo and his Fleans liues
2 1543 
2 1544    Lady. But in them, Natures Coppie's not eterne
2 1545 
2 1546    Macb. There's comfort yet, they are assaileable,
2 1547 Then be thou iocund: ere the Bat hath flowne
2 1548 His Cloyster'd flight, ere to black Heccats summons
2 1549 The shard-borne Beetle, with his drowsie hums,
2 1550 Hath rung Nights yawning Peale,
2 1551 There shall be done a deed of dreadfull note
2 1552 
2 1553    Lady. What's to be done?
2 1554   Macb. Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest Chuck,
2 1555 Till thou applaud the deed: Come, seeling Night,
2 1556 Skarfe vp the tender Eye of pittifull Day,
2 1557 And with thy bloodie and inuisible Hand
2 1558 Cancell and teare to pieces that great Bond,
2 1559 Which keepes me pale. Light thickens,
2 1560 And the Crow makes Wing toth' Rookie Wood:
2 1561 Good things of Day begin to droope, and drowse,
2 1562 Whiles Nights black Agents to their Prey's doe rowse.
2 1563 Thou maruell'st at my words: but hold thee still,
2 1564 Things bad begun, make strong themselues by ill:
2 1565 So prythee goe with me.
2 1566 
2 1567 Exeunt.
2 1568 
2 1569 
2 1570 Scena Tertia.
2 1571 
2 1572 Enter three Murtherers.
2 1573 
2 1574   1. But who did bid thee ioyne with vs?
2 1575   3. Macbeth
2 1576 
2 1577    2. He needes not our mistrust, since he deliuers
2 1578 Our Offices, and what we haue to doe,
2 1579 To the direction iust
2 1580 
2 1581    1. Then stand with vs:
2 1582 The West yet glimmers with some streakes of Day.
2 1583 Now spurres the lated Traueller apace,
2 1584 To gayne the timely Inne, and neere approches
2 1585 The subiect of our Watch
2 1586 
2 1587    3. Hearke, I heare Horses
2 1588 
2 1589    Banquo within. Giue vs a Light there, hoa
2 1590 
2 1591    2. Then 'tis hee:
2 1592 The rest, that are within the note of expectation,
2 1593 Alreadie are i'th' Court
2 1594 
2 1595    1. His Horses goe about
2 1596 
2 1597    3. Almost a mile: but he does vsually,
2 1598 So all men doe, from hence toth' Pallace Gate
2 1599 Make it their Walke.
2 1600 Enter Banquo and Fleans, with a Torch.
2 1601 
2 1602   2. A Light, a Light
2 1603 
2 1604    3. 'Tis hee
2 1605 
2 1606    1. Stand too't
2 1607 
2 1608    Ban. It will be Rayne to Night
2 1609 
2 1610    1. Let it come downe
2 1611 
2 1612    Ban. O, Trecherie!
2 1613 Flye good Fleans, flye, flye, flye,
2 1614 Thou may'st reuenge. O Slaue!
2 1615   3. Who did strike out the Light?
2 1616   1. Was't not the way?
2 1617   3. There's but one downe: the Sonne is fled
2 1618 
2 1619    2. We haue lost
2 1620 Best halfe of our Affaire
2 1621 
2 1622    1. Well, let's away, and say how much is done.
2 1623 
2 1624 Exeunt.
2 1625 
2 1626 
2 1627 Scaena Quarta.
2 1628 
2 1629 Banquet prepar'd. Enter Macbeth, Lady, Rosse, Lenox, Lords, and
2 1630 Attendants.
2 1631 
2 1632   Macb. You know your owne degrees, sit downe:
2 1633 At first and last, the hearty welcome
2 1634 
2 1635    Lords. Thankes to your Maiesty
2 1636 
2 1637    Macb. Our selfe will mingle with Society,
2 1638 And play the humble Host:
2 1639 Our Hostesse keepes her State, but in best time
2 1640 We will require her welcome
2 1641 
2 1642    La. Pronounce it for me Sir, to all our Friends,
2 1643 For my heart speakes, they are welcome.
2 1644 Enter first Murtherer.
2 1645 
2 1646   Macb. See they encounter thee with their harts thanks
2 1647 Both sides are euen: heere Ile sit i'th' mid'st,
2 1648 Be large in mirth, anon wee'l drinke a Measure
2 1649 The Table round. There's blood vpon thy face
2 1650 
2 1651    Mur. 'Tis Banquo's then
2 1652 
2 1653    Macb. 'Tis better thee without, then he within.
2 1654 Is he dispatch'd?
2 1655   Mur. My Lord his throat is cut, that I did for him
2 1656 
2 1657    Mac. Thou art the best o'th' Cut-throats,
2 1658 Yet hee's good that did the like for Fleans:
2 1659 If thou did'st it, thou art the Non-pareill
2 1660 
2 1661    Mur. Most Royall Sir
2 1662 Fleans is scap'd
2 1663 
2 1664    Macb. Then comes my Fit againe:
2 1665 I had else beene perfect;
2 1666 Whole as the Marble, founded as the Rocke,
2 1667 As broad, and generall, as the casing Ayre:
2 1668 But now I am cabin'd, crib'd, confin'd, bound in
2 1669 To sawcy doubts, and feares. But Banquo's safe?
2 1670   Mur. I, my good Lord: safe in a ditch he bides,
2 1671 With twenty trenched gashes on his head;
2 1672 The least a Death to Nature
2 1673 
2 1674    Macb. Thankes for that:
2 1675 There the growne Serpent lyes, the worme that's fled
2 1676 Hath Nature that in time will Venom breed,
2 1677 No teeth for th' present. Get thee gone, to morrow
2 1678 Wee'l heare our selues againe.
2 1679 
2 1680 Exit Murderer.
2 1681 
2 1682   Lady. My Royall Lord,
2 1683 You do not giue the Cheere, the Feast is sold
2 1684 That is not often vouch'd, while 'tis a making:
2 1685 'Tis giuen, with welcome: to feede were best at home:
2 1686 From thence, the sawce to meate is Ceremony,
2 1687 Meeting were bare without it.
2 1688 Enter the Ghost of Banquo, and sits in Macbeths place.
2 1689 
2 1690   Macb. Sweet Remembrancer:
2 1691 Now good digestion waite on Appetite,
2 1692 And health on both
2 1693 
2 1694    Lenox. May't please your Highnesse sit
2 1695 
2 1696    Macb. Here had we now our Countries Honor, roof'd,
2 1697 Were the grac'd person of our Banquo present:
2 1698 Who, may I rather challenge for vnkindnesse,
2 1699 Then pitty for Mischance
2 1700 
2 1701    Rosse. His absence (Sir)
2 1702 Layes blame vpon his promise. Pleas't your Highnesse
2 1703 To grace vs with your Royall Company?
2 1704   Macb. The Table's full
2 1705 
2 1706    Lenox. Heere is a place reseru'd Sir
2 1707 
2 1708    Macb. Where?
2 1709   Lenox. Heere my good Lord.
2 1710 What is't that moues your Highnesse?
2 1711   Macb. Which of you haue done this?
2 1712   Lords. What, my good Lord?
2 1713   Macb. Thou canst not say I did it: neuer shake
2 1714 Thy goary lockes at me
2 1715 
2 1716    Rosse. Gentlemen rise, his Highnesse is not well
2 1717 
2 1718    Lady. Sit worthy Friends: my Lord is often thus,
2 1719 And hath beene from his youth. Pray you keepe Seat,
2 1720 The fit is momentary, vpon a thought
2 1721 He will againe be well. If much you note him
2 1722 You shall offend him, and extend his Passion,
2 1723 Feed, and regard him not. Are you a man?
2 1724   Macb. I, and a bold one, that dare looke on that
2 1725 Which might appall the Diuell
2 1726 
2 1727    La. O proper stuffe:
2 1728 This is the very painting of your feare:
2 1729 This is the Ayre-drawne-Dagger which you said
2 1730 Led you to Duncan. O, these flawes and starts
2 1731 (Impostors to true feare) would well become
2 1732 A womans story, at a Winters fire
2 1733 Authoriz'd by her Grandam: shame it selfe,
2 1734 Why do you make such faces? When all's done
2 1735 You looke but on a stoole
2 1736 
2 1737    Macb. Prythee see there:
2 1738 Behold, looke, loe, how say you:
2 1739 Why what care I, if thou canst nod, speake too.
2 1740 If Charnell houses, and our Graues must send
2 1741 Those that we bury, backe; our Monuments
2 1742 Shall be the Mawes of Kytes
2 1743 
2 1744    La. What? quite vnmann'd in folly
2 1745 
2 1746    Macb. If I stand heere, I saw him
2 1747 
2 1748    La. Fie for shame
2 1749 
2 1750    Macb. Blood hath bene shed ere now, i'th' olden time
2 1751 Ere humane Statute purg'd the gentle Weale:
2 1752 I, and since too, Murthers haue bene perform'd
2 1753 Too terrible for the eare. The times has bene,
2 1754 That when the Braines were out, the man would dye,
2 1755 And there an end: But now they rise againe
2 1756 With twenty mortall murthers on their crownes,
2 1757 And push vs from our stooles. This is more strange
2 1758 Then such a murther is
2 1759 
2 1760    La. My worthy Lord
2 1761 Your Noble Friends do lacke you
2 1762 
2 1763    Macb. I do forget:
2 1764 Do not muse at me my most worthy Friends,
2 1765 I haue a strange infirmity, which is nothing
2 1766 To those that know me. Come, loue and health to all,
2 1767 Then Ile sit downe: Giue me some Wine, fill full:
2 1768 Enter Ghost.
2 1769 
2 1770 I drinke to th' generall ioy o'th' whole Table,
2 1771 And to our deere Friend Banquo, whom we misse:
2 1772 Would he were heere: to all, and him we thirst,
2 1773 And all to all
2 1774 
2 1775    Lords. Our duties, and the pledge
2 1776 
2 1777    Mac. Auant, & quit my sight, let the earth hide thee:
2 1778 Thy bones are marrowlesse, thy blood is cold:
2 1779 Thou hast no speculation in those eyes
2 1780 Which thou dost glare with
2 1781 
2 1782    La. Thinke of this good Peeres
2 1783 But as a thing of Custome: 'Tis no other,
2 1784 Onely it spoyles the pleasure of the time
2 1785 
2 1786    Macb. What man dare, I dare:
2 1787 Approach thou like the rugged Russian Beare,
2 1788 The arm'd Rhinoceros, or th' Hircan Tiger,
2 1789 Take any shape but that, and my firme Nerues
2 1790 Shall neuer tremble. Or be aliue againe,
2 1791 And dare me to the Desart with thy Sword:
2 1792 If trembling I inhabit then, protest mee
2 1793 The Baby of a Girle. Hence horrible shadow,
2 1794 Vnreall mock'ry hence. Why so, being gone
2 1795 I am a man againe: pray you sit still
2 1796 
2 1797    La. You haue displac'd the mirth,
2 1798 Broke the good meeting, with most admir'd disorder
2 1799 
2 1800    Macb. Can such things be,
2 1801 And ouercome vs like a Summers Clowd,
2 1802 Without our speciall wonder? You make me strange
2 1803 Euen to the disposition that I owe,
2 1804 When now I thinke you can behold such sights,
2 1805 And keepe the naturall Rubie of your Cheekes,
2 1806 When mine is blanch'd with feare
2 1807 
2 1808    Rosse. What sights, my Lord?
2 1809   La. I pray you speake not: he growes worse & worse
2 1810 Question enrages him: at once, goodnight.
2 1811 Stand not vpon the order of your going,
2 1812 But go at once
2 1813 
2 1814    Len. Good night, and better health
2 1815 Attend his Maiesty
2 1816 
2 1817    La. A kinde goodnight to all.
2 1818 
2 1819 Exit Lords.
2 1820 
2 1821   Macb. It will haue blood they say:
2 1822 Blood will haue Blood:
2 1823 Stones haue beene knowne to moue, & Trees to speake:
2 1824 Augures, and vnderstood Relations, haue
2 1825 By Maggot Pyes, & Choughes, & Rookes brought forth
2 1826 The secret'st man of Blood. What is the night?
2 1827   La. Almost at oddes with morning, which is which
2 1828 
2 1829    Macb. How say'st thou that Macduff denies his person
2 1830 At our great bidding
2 1831 
2 1832    La. Did you send to him Sir?
2 1833   Macb. I heare it by the way: But I will send:
2 1834 There's not a one of them but in his house
2 1835 I keepe a Seruant Feed. I will to morrow
2 1836 (And betimes I will) to the weyard Sisters.
2 1837 More shall they speake: for now I am bent to know
2 1838 By the worst meanes, the worst, for mine owne good,
2 1839 All causes shall giue way. I am in blood
2 1840 Stept in so farre, that should I wade no more,
2 1841 Returning were as tedious as go ore:
2 1842 Strange things I haue in head, that will to hand,
2 1843 Which must be acted, ere they may be scand
2 1844 
2 1845    La. You lacke the season of all Natures, sleepe
2 1846 
2 1847    Macb. Come, wee'l to sleepe: My strange & self-abuse
2 1848 Is the initiate feare, that wants hard vse:
2 1849 We are yet but yong indeed.
2 1850 
2 1851 Exeunt.
2 1852 
2 1853 
2 1854 Scena Quinta.
2 1855 
2 1856 Thunder. Enter the three Witches, meeting Hecat.
2 1857 
2 1858   1. Why how now Hecat, you looke angerly?
2 1859   Hec. Haue I not reason (Beldams) as you are?
2 1860 Sawcy, and ouer-bold, how did you dare
2 1861 To Trade, and Trafficke with Macbeth,
2 1862 In Riddles, and Affaires of death;
2 1863 And I the Mistris of your Charmes,
2 1864 The close contriuer of all harmes,
2 1865 Was neuer call'd to beare my part,
2 1866 Or shew the glory of our Art?
2 1867 And which is worse, all you haue done
2 1868 Hath bene but for a wayward Sonne,
2 1869 Spightfull, and wrathfull, who (as others do)
2 1870 Loues for his owne ends, not for you.
2 1871 But make amends now: Get you gon,
2 1872 And at the pit of Acheron
2 1873 Meete me i'th' Morning: thither he
2 1874 Will come, to know his Destinie.
2 1875 Your Vessels, and your Spels prouide,
2 1876 Your Charmes, and euery thing beside;
2 1877 I am for th' Ayre: This night Ile spend
2 1878 Vnto a dismall, and a Fatall end.
2 1879 Great businesse must be wrought ere Noone.
2 1880 Vpon the Corner of the Moone
2 1881 There hangs a vap'rous drop, profound,
2 1882 Ile catch it ere it come to ground;
2 1883 And that distill'd by Magicke slights,
2 1884 Shall raise such Artificiall Sprights,
2 1885 As by the strength of their illusion,
2 1886 Shall draw him on to his Confusion.
2 1887 He shall spurne Fate, scorne Death, and beare
2 1888 His hopes 'boue Wisedome, Grace, and Feare:
2 1889 And you all know, Security
2 1890 Is Mortals cheefest Enemie.
2 1891 
2 1892 Musicke, and a Song.
2 1893 
2 1894 Hearke, I am call'd: my little Spirit see
2 1895 Sits in Foggy cloud, and stayes for me.
2 1896 
2 1897 Sing within. Come away, come away, &c.
2 1898 
2 1899   1 Come, let's make hast, shee'l soone be
2 1900 Backe againe.
2 1901 
2 1902 Exeunt.
2 1903 
2 1904 
2 1905 Scaena Sexta.
2 1906 
2 1907 Enter Lenox, and another Lord.
2 1908 
2 1909   Lenox. My former Speeches,
2 1910 Haue but hit your Thoughts
2 1911 Which can interpret farther: Onely I say
2 1912 Things haue bin strangely borne. The gracious Duncan
2 1913 Was pittied of Macbeth: marry he was dead:
2 1914 And the right valiant Banquo walk'd too late,
2 1915 Whom you may say (if't please you) Fleans kill'd,
2 1916 For Fleans fled: Men must not walke too late.
2 1917 Who cannot want the thought, how monstrous
2 1918 It was for Malcolme, and for Donalbane
2 1919 To kill their gracious Father? Damned Fact,
2 1920 How it did greeue Macbeth? Did he not straight
2 1921 In pious rage, the two delinquents teare,
2 1922 That were the Slaues of drinke, and thralles of sleepe?
2 1923 Was not that Nobly done? I, and wisely too:
2 1924 For 'twould haue anger'd any heart aliue
2 1925 To heare the men deny't. So that I say,
2 1926 He ha's borne all things well, and I do thinke,
2 1927 That had he Duncans Sonnes vnder his Key,
2 1928 (As, and't please Heauen he shall not) they should finde
2 1929 What 'twere to kill a Father: So should Fleans.
2 1930 But peace; for from broad words, and cause he fayl'd
2 1931 His presence at the Tyrants Feast, I heare
2 1932 Macduffe liues in disgrace. Sir, can you tell
2 1933 Where he bestowes himselfe?
2 1934   Lord. The Sonnes of Duncane
2 1935 (From whom this Tyrant holds the due of Birth)
2 1936 Liues in the English Court, and is receyu'd
2 1937 Of the most Pious Edward, with such grace,
2 1938 That the maleuolence of Fortune, nothing
2 1939 Takes from his high respect. Thither Macduffe
2 1940 Is gone, to pray the Holy King, vpon his ayd
2 1941 To wake Northumberland, and warlike Seyward,
2 1942 That by the helpe of these (with him aboue)
2 1943 To ratifie the Worke) we may againe
2 1944 Giue to our Tables meate, sleepe to our Nights:
2 1945 Free from our Feasts, and Banquets bloody kniues;
2 1946 Do faithfull Homage, and receiue free Honors,
2 1947 All which we pine for now. And this report
2 1948 Hath so exasperate their King, that hee
2 1949 Prepares for some attempt of Warre
2 1950 
2 1951    Len. Sent he to Macduffe?
2 1952   Lord. He did: and with an absolute Sir, not I
2 1953 The clowdy Messenger turnes me his backe,
2 1954 And hums; as who should say, you'l rue the time
2 1955 That clogges me with this Answer
2 1956 
2 1957    Lenox. And that well might
2 1958 Aduise him to a Caution, t' hold what distance
2 1959 His wisedome can prouide. Some holy Angell
2 1960 Flye to the Court of England, and vnfold
2 1961 His Message ere he come, that a swift blessing
2 1962 May soone returne to this our suffering Country,
2 1963 Vnder a hand accurs'd
2 1964 
2 1965    Lord. Ile send my Prayers with him.
2 1966 
2 1967 Exeunt.

2 1985 
2 1986    All. Double, double, toile and trouble;
2 1987 Fire burne, and Cauldron bubble
2 1988 
2 1989    2 Fillet of a Fenny Snake,
2 1990 In the Cauldron boyle and bake:
2 1991 Eye of Newt, and Toe of Frogge,
2 1992 Wooll of Bat, and Tongue of Dogge:
2 1993 Adders Forke, and Blinde-wormes Sting,
2 1994 Lizards legge, and Howlets wing:
2 1995 For a Charme of powrefull trouble,
2 1996 Like a Hell-broth, boyle and bubble
2 1997 
2 1998    All. Double, double, toyle and trouble,
2 1999 Fire burne, and Cauldron bubble

2 2004 Roote of Hemlocke, digg'd i'th' darke:
2 2005 Liuer of Blaspheming Iew,
2 2006 Gall of Goate, and Slippes of Yew,
2 2007 Sliuer'd in the Moones Ecclipse:
2 2008 Nose of Turke, and Tartars lips:
2 2009 Finger of Birth-strangled Babe,
2 2010 Ditch-deliuer'd by a Drab,
2 2011 Make the Grewell thicke, and slab.
2 2012 Adde thereto a Tigers Chawdron,
2 2013 For th' Ingredience of our Cawdron
2 2014 
2 2015    All. Double, double, toyle and trouble,
2 2016 Fire burne, and Cauldron bubble
2 2017 
2 2018    2 Coole it with a Baboones blood,
2 2019 Then the Charme is firme and good.
2 2020 Enter Hecat, and the other three Witches.
2 2021 
2 2022   Hec. O well done: I commend your paines,
2 2023 And euery one shall share i'th' gaines:
2 2024 And now about the Cauldron sing
2 2025 Like Elues and Fairies in a Ring,
2 2026 Inchanting all that you put in.
2 2027 
2 2028 Musicke and a Song. Blacke Spirits, &c.
2 2029 
2 2030   2 By the pricking of my Thumbes,
2 2031 Something wicked this way comes:
2 2032 Open Lockes, who euer knockes.
2 2033 Enter Macbeth.
2 2034 
2 2035   Macb. How now you secret, black, & midnight Hags?
2 2036 What is't you do?
2 2037   All. A deed without a name
2 2038 
2 2039    Macb. I coniure you, by that which you Professe,
2 2040 (How ere you come to know it) answer me:
2 2041 Though you vntye the Windes, and let them fight
2 2042 Against the Churches: Though the yesty Waues
2 2043 Confound and swallow Nauigation vp:
2 2044 Though bladed Corne be lodg'd, & Trees blown downe,
2 2045 Though Castles topple on their Warders heads:
2 2046 Though Pallaces, and Pyramids do slope
2 2047 Their heads to their Foundations: Though the treasure
2 2048 Of Natures Germaine, tumble altogether,
2 2049 Euen till destruction sicken: Answer me
2 2050 To what I aske you
2 2051 
2 2052    1 Speake
2 2053 
2 2054    2 Demand
2 2055 
2 2056    3 Wee'l answer
2 2057 
2 2058    1 Say, if th'hadst rather heare it from our mouthes,
2 2059 Or from our Masters
2 2060 
2 2061    Macb. Call 'em: let me see 'em
2 2062 
2 2063    1 Powre in Sowes blood, that hath eaten
2 2064 Her nine Farrow: Greaze that's sweaten
2 2065 From the Murderers Gibbet, throw
2 2066 Into the Flame
2 2067 
2 2068    All. Come high or low:
2 2069 Thy Selfe and Office deaftly show.
2 2070 Thunder. 1. Apparation, an Armed Head.
2 2071 
2 2072   Macb. Tell me, thou vnknowne power
2 2073 
2 2074    1 He knowes thy thought:
2 2075 Heare his speech, but say thou nought
2 2076 
2 2077    1 Appar. Macbeth, Macbeth, Macbeth:
2 2078 Beware Macduffe,
2 2079 Beware the Thane of Fife: dismisse me. Enough.
2 2080 
2 2081 He Descends.
2 2082 
2 2083   Macb. What ere thou art, for thy good caution, thanks
2 2084 Thou hast harp'd my feare aright. But one word more
2 2085 
2 2086    1 He will not be commanded: heere's another
2 2087 More potent then the first.
2 2088 
2 2089 Thunder. 2 Apparition, a Bloody Childe.
2 2090 
2 2091   2 Appar. Macbeth, Macbeth, Macbeth
2 2092 
2 2093    Macb. Had I three eares, Il'd heare thee
2 2094 
2 2095    Appar. Be bloody, bold, & resolute:
2 2096 Laugh to scorne
2 2097 The powre of man: For none of woman borne
2 2098 Shall harme Macbeth.
2 2099 
2 2100 Descends.
2 2101 
2 2102   Mac. Then liue Macduffe: what need I feare of thee?
2 2103 But yet Ile make assurance: double sure,
2 2104 And take a Bond of Fate: thou shalt not liue,
2 2105 That I may tell pale-hearted Feare, it lies;
2 2106 And sleepe in spight of Thunder.
2 2107 
2 2108 Thunder 3 Apparation, a Childe Crowned, with a Tree in his hand.
2 2109 
2 2110 What is this, that rises like the issue of a King,
2 2111 And weares vpon his Baby-brow, the round
2 2112 And top of Soueraignty?
2 2113   All. Listen, but speake not too't
2 2114 
2 2115    3 Appar. Be Lyon metled, proud, and take no care:
2 2116 Who chafes, who frets, or where Conspirers are:
2 2117 Macbeth shall neuer vanquish'd be, vntill
2 2118 Great Byrnam Wood, to high Dunsmane Hill
2 2119 Shall come against him.
2 2120 
2 2121 Descend.
2 2122 
2 2123   Macb. That will neuer bee:
2 2124 Who can impresse the Forrest, bid the Tree
2 2125 Vnfixe his earth-bound Root? Sweet boadments, good:
2 2126 Rebellious dead, rise neuer till the Wood
2 2127 Of Byrnan rise, and our high plac'd Macbeth
2 2128 Shall liue the Lease of Nature, pay his breath
2 2129 To time, and mortall Custome. Yet my Hart
2 2130 Throbs to know one thing: Tell me, if your Art
2 2131 Can tell so much: Shall Banquo's issue euer
2 2132 Reigne in this Kingdome?
2 2133   All. Seeke to know no more
2 2134 
2 2135    Macb. I will be satisfied. Deny me this,
2 2136 And an eternall Curse fall on you: Let me know.
2 2137 Why sinkes that Caldron? & what noise is this?
2 2138 
2 2139 Hoboyes
2 2140 
2 2141   1 Shew
2 2142 
2 2143    2 Shew
2 2144 
2 2145    3 Shew
2 2146 
2 2147    All. Shew his Eyes, and greeue his Hart,
2 2148 Come like shadowes, so depart.
2 2149 
2 2150 A shew of eight Kings, and Banquo last, with a glasse in his hand.
2 2151 
2 2152   Macb. Thou art too like the Spirit of Banquo: Down:
2 2153 Thy Crowne do's seare mine Eye-bals. And thy haire
2 2154 Thou other Gold-bound-brow, is like the first:
2 2155 A third, is like the former. Filthy Hagges,
2 2156 Why do you shew me this? - A fourth? Start eyes!
2 2157 What will the Line stretch out to'th' cracke of Doome?
2 2158 Another yet? A seauenth? Ile see no more:
2 2159 And yet the eighth appeares, who beares a glasse,
2 2160 Which shewes me many more: and some I see,
2 2161 That two-fold Balles, and trebble Scepters carry.
2 2162 Horrible sight: Now I see 'tis true,
2 2163 For the Blood-bolter'd Banquo smiles vpon me,
2 2164 And points at them for his. What? is this so?
2 2165   1 I Sir, all this is so. But why
2 2166 Stands Macbeth thus amazedly?
2 2167 Come Sisters, cheere we vp his sprights,
2 2168 And shew the best of our delights.
2 2169 Ile Charme the Ayre to giue a sound,
2 2170 While you performe your Antique round:
2 2171 That this great King may kindly say,
2 2172 Our duties, did his welcome pay.
2 2173 
2 2174 Musicke. The Witches Dance, and vanish.
2 2175 
2 2176   Macb. Where are they? Gone?
2 2177 Let this pernitious houre,
2 2178 Stand aye accursed in the Kalender.
2 2179 Come in, without there.
2 2180 Enter Lenox.
2 2181 
2 2182   Lenox. What's your Graces will
2 2183 
2 2184    Macb. Saw you the Weyard Sisters?
2 2185   Lenox. No my Lord
2 2186 
2 2187    Macb. Came they not by you?
2 2188   Lenox. No indeed my Lord
2 2189 
2 2190    Macb. Infected be the Ayre whereon they ride,
2 2191 And damn'd all those that trust them. I did heare
2 2192 The gallopping of Horse. Who was't came by?
2 2193   Len. 'Tis two or three my Lord, that bring you word:
2 2194 Macduff is fled to England
2 2195 
2 2196    Macb. Fled to England?
2 2197   Len. I, my good Lord
2 2198 
2 2199    Macb. Time, thou anticipat'st my dread exploits:
2 2200 The flighty purpose neuer is o're-tooke
2 2201 Vnlesse the deed go with it. From this moment,
2 2202 The very firstlings of my heart shall be
2 2203 The firstlings of my hand. And euen now
2 2204 To Crown my thoughts with Acts: be it thoght & done:
2 2205 The Castle of Macduff, I will surprize.
2 2206 Seize vpon Fife; giue to th' edge o'th' Sword
2 2207 His Wife, his Babes, and all vnfortunate Soules
2 2208 That trace him in his Line. No boasting like a Foole,
2 2209 This deed Ile do, before this purpose coole,
2 2210 But no more sights. Where are these Gentlemen?
2 2211 Come bring me where they are.
2 2212 
2 2213 Exeunt.
2 2214 
2 2215 Scena Secunda.
2 2216 
2 2217 Enter Macduffes Wife, her Son, and Rosse.
2 2218 
2 2219   Wife. What had he done, to make him fly the Land?
2 2220   Rosse. You must haue patience Madam
2 2221 
2 2222    Wife. He had none:
2 2223 His flight was madnesse: when our Actions do not,
2 2224 Our feares do make vs Traitors
2 2225 
2 2226    Rosse. You know not
2 2227 Whether it was his wisedome, or his feare
2 2228 
2 2229    Wife. Wisedom? to leaue his wife, to leaue his Babes,
2 2230 His Mansion, and his Titles, in a place
2 2231 From whence himselfe do's flye? He loues vs not,
2 2232 He wants the naturall touch. For the poore Wren
2 2233 (The most diminitiue of Birds) will fight,
2 2234 Her yong ones in her Nest, against the Owle:
2 2235 All is the Feare, and nothing is the Loue;
2 2236 As little is the Wisedome, where the flight
2 2237 So runnes against all reason
2 2238 
2 2239    Rosse. My deerest Cooz,
2 2240 I pray you schoole your selfe. But for your Husband,
2 2241 He is Noble, Wise, Iudicious, and best knowes
2 2242 The fits o'th' Season. I dare not speake much further,
2 2243 But cruell are the times, when we are Traitors
2 2244 And do not know our selues: when we hold Rumor
2 2245 From what we feare, yet know not what we feare,
2 2246 But floate vpon a wilde and violent Sea
2 2247 Each way, and moue. I take my leaue of you:
2 2248 Shall not be long but Ile be heere againe:
2 2249 Things at the worst will cease, or else climbe vpward,
2 2250 To what they were before. My pretty Cosine,
2 2251 Blessing vpon you
2 2252 
2 2253    Wife. Father'd he is,
2 2254 And yet hee's Father-lesse
2 2255 
2 2256    Rosse. I am so much a Foole, should I stay longer
2 2257 It would be my disgrace, and your discomfort.
2 2258 I take my leaue at once.
2 2259 
2 2260 Exit Rosse.
2 2261 
2 2262   Wife. Sirra, your Fathers dead,
2 2263 And what will you do now? How will you liue?
2 2264   Son. As Birds do Mother
2 2265 
2 2266    Wife. What with Wormes, and Flyes?
2 2267   Son. With what I get I meane, and so do they
2 2268 
2 2269    Wife. Poore Bird,
2 2270 Thou'dst neuer Feare the Net, nor Lime,
2 2271 The Pitfall, nor the Gin
2 2272 
2 2273    Son. Why should I Mother?
2 2274 Poore Birds they are not set for:
2 2275 My Father is not dead for all your saying
2 2276 
2 2277    Wife. Yes, he is dead:
2 2278 How wilt thou do for a Father?
2 2279   Son. Nay how will you do for a Husband?
2 2280   Wife. Why I can buy me twenty at any Market
2 2281 
2 2282    Son. Then you'l by 'em to sell againe
2 2283 
2 2284    Wife. Thou speak'st withall thy wit,
2 2285 And yet I'faith with wit enough for thee
2 2286 
2 2287    Son. Was my Father a Traitor, Mother?
2 2288   Wife. I, that he was
2 2289 
2 2290    Son. What is a Traitor?
2 2291   Wife. Why one that sweares, and lyes
2 2292 
2 2293    Son. And be all Traitors, that do so
2 2294 
2 2295    Wife. Euery one that do's so, is a Traitor,
2 2296 And must be hang'd
2 2297 
2 2298    Son. And must they all be hang'd, that swear and lye?
2 2299   Wife. Euery one
2 2300 
2 2301    Son. Who must hang them?
2 2302   Wife. Why, the honest men
2 2303 
2 2304    Son. Then the Liars and Swearers are Fools: for there
2 2305 are Lyars and Swearers enow, to beate the honest men,
2 2306 and hang vp them
2 2307 
2 2308    Wife. Now God helpe thee, poore Monkie:
2 2309 But how wilt thou do for a Father?
2 2310   Son. If he were dead, youl'd weepe for him: if you
2 2311 would not, it were a good signe, that I should quickely
2 2312 haue a new Father
2 2313 
2 2314    Wife. Poore pratler, how thou talk'st?
2 2315 Enter a Messenger.
2 2316 
2 2317   Mes. Blesse you faire Dame: I am not to you known,
2 2318 Though in your state of Honor I am perfect;
2 2319 I doubt some danger do's approach you neerely.
2 2320 If you will take a homely mans aduice,
2 2321 Be not found heere: Hence with your little ones
2 2322 To fright you thus. Me thinkes I am too sauage:
2 2323 To do worse to you, were fell Cruelty,
2 2324 Which is too nie your person. Heauen preserue you,
2 2325 I dare abide no longer.
2 2326 
2 2327 Exit Messenger
2 2328 
2 2329   Wife. Whether should I flye?
2 2330 I haue done no harme. But I remember now
2 2331 I am in this earthly world: where to do harme
2 2332 Is often laudable, to do good sometime
2 2333 Accounted dangerous folly. Why then (alas)
2 2334 Do I put vp that womanly defence,
2 2335 To say I haue done no harme?
2 2336 What are these faces?
2 2337 Enter Murtherers.
2 2338 
2 2339   Mur. Where is your Husband?
2 2340   Wife. I hope in no place so vnsanctified,
2 2341 Where such as thou may'st finde him
2 2342 
2 2343    Mur. He's a Traitor
2 2344 
2 2345    Son. Thou ly'st thou shagge-ear'd Villaine
2 2346 
2 2347    Mur. What you Egge?
2 2348 Yong fry of Treachery?
2 2349   Son. He ha's kill'd me Mother,
2 2350 Run away I pray you.
2 2351 
2 2352 Exit crying Murther.
2 2353 
2 2354 
2 2355 Scaena Tertia.
2 2356 
2 2357 Enter Malcolme and Macduffe.
2 2358 
2 2359   Mal. Let vs seeke out some desolate shade, & there
2 2360 Weepe our sad bosomes empty
2 2361 
2 2362    Macd. Let vs rather
2 2363 Hold fast the mortall Sword: and like good men,
2 2364 Bestride our downfall Birthdome: each new Morne,
2 2365 New Widdowes howle, new Orphans cry, new sorowes
2 2366 Strike heauen on the face, that it resounds
2 2367 As if it felt with Scotland, and yell'd out
2 2368 Like Syllable of Dolour
2 2369 
2 2370    Mal. What I beleeue, Ile waile;
2 2371 What know, beleeue; and what I can redresse,
2 2372 As I shall finde the time to friend: I wil.
2 2373 What you haue spoke, it may be so perchance.
2 2374 This Tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,
2 2375 Was once thought honest: you haue lou'd him well,
2 2376 He hath not touch'd you yet. I am yong, but something
2 2377 You may discerne of him through me, and wisedome
2 2378 To offer vp a weake, poore innocent Lambe
2 2379 T' appease an angry God
2 2380 
2 2381    Macd. I am not treacherous
2 2382 
2 2383    Malc. But Macbeth is.
2 2384 A good and vertuous Nature may recoyle
2 2385 In an Imperiall charge. But I shall craue your pardon:
2 2386 That which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose;
2 2387 Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell.
2 2388 Though all things foule, would wear the brows of grace
2 2389 Yet Grace must still looke so
2 2390 
2 2391    Macd. I haue lost my Hopes
2 2392 
2 2393    Malc. Perchance euen there
2 2394 Where I did finde my doubts.
2 2395 Why in that rawnesse left you Wife, and Childe?
2 2396 Those precious Motiues, those strong knots of Loue,
2 2397 Without leaue-taking. I pray you,
2 2398 Let not my Iealousies, be your Dishonors,
2 2399 But mine owne Safeties: you may be rightly iust,
2 2400 What euer I shall thinke
2 2401 
2 2402    Macd. Bleed, bleed poore Country,
2 2403 Great Tyrrany, lay thou thy basis sure,
2 2404 For goodnesse dare not check thee: wear y thy wrongs,
2 2405 The Title, is affear'd. Far thee well Lord,
2 2406 I would not be the Villaine that thou think'st,
2 2407 For the whole Space that's in the Tyrants Graspe,
2 2408 And the rich East to boot
2 2409 
2 2410    Mal. Be not offended:
2 2411 I speake not as in absolute feare of you:
2 2412 I thinke our Country sinkes beneath the yoake,
2 2413 It weepes, it bleeds, and each new day a gash
2 2414 Is added to her wounds. I thinke withall,
2 2415 There would be hands vplifted in my right:
2 2416 And heere from gracious England haue I offer
2 2417 Of goodly thousands. But for all this,
2 2418 When I shall treade vpon the Tyrants head,
2 2419 Or weare it on my Sword; yet my poore Country
2 2420 Shall haue more vices then it had before,
2 2421 More suffer, and more sundry wayes then euer,
2 2422 By him that shall succeede
2 2423 
2 2424    Macd. What should he be?
2 2425   Mal. It is my selfe I meane: in whom I know
2 2426 All the particulars of Vice so grafted,
2 2427 That when they shall be open'd, blacke Macbeth
2 2428 Will seeme as pure as Snow, and the poore State
2 2429 Esteeme him as a Lambe, being compar'd
2 2430 With my confinelesse harmes
2 2431 
2 2432    Macd. Not in the Legions
2 2433 Of horrid Hell, can come a Diuell more damn'd
2 2434 In euils, to top Macbeth
2 2435 
2 2436    Mal. I grant him Bloody,
2 2437 Luxurious, Auaricious, False, Deceitfull,
2 2438 Sodaine, Malicious, smacking of euery sinne
2 2439 That ha's a name. But there's no bottome, none
2 2440 In my Voluptuousnesse: Your Wiues, your Daughters,
2 2441 Your Matrons, and your Maides, could not fill vp
2 2442 The Cesterne of my Lust, and my Desire
2 2443 All continent Impediments would ore-beare
2 2444 That did oppose my will. Better Macbeth,
2 2445 Then such an one to reigne
2 2446 
2 2447    Macd. Boundlesse intemperance
2 2448 In Nature is a Tyranny: It hath beene
2 2449 Th' vntimely emptying of the happy Throne,
2 2450 And fall of many Kings. But feare not yet
2 2451 To take vpon you what is yours: you may
2 2452 Conuey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,
2 2453 And yet seeme cold. The time you may so hoodwinke:
2 2454 We haue willing Dames enough: there cannot be
2 2455 That Vulture in you, to deuoure so many
2 2456 As will to Greatnesse dedicate themselues,
2 2457 Finding it so inclinde
2 2458 
2 2459    Mal. With this, there growes
2 2460 In my most ill-composd Affection, such
2 2461 A stanchlesse Auarice, that were I King,
2 2462 I should cut off the Nobles for their Lands,
2 2463 Desire his Iewels, and this others House,
2 2464 And my more-hauing, would be as a Sawce
2 2465 To make me hunger more, that I should forge
2 2466 Quarrels vniust against the Good and Loyall,
2 2467 Destroying them for wealth
2 2468 
2 2469    Macd. This Auarice
2 2470 stickes deeper: growes with more pernicious roote
2 2471 Then Summer-seeming Lust: and it hath bin
2 2472 The Sword of our slaine Kings: yet do not feare,
2 2473 Scotland hath Foysons, to fill vp your will
2 2474 Of your meere Owne. All these are portable,
2 2475 With other Graces weigh'd
2 2476 
2 2477    Mal. But I haue none. The King-becoming Graces,
2 2478 As Iustice, Verity, Temp'rance, Stablenesse,
2 2479 Bounty, Perseuerance, Mercy, Lowlinesse,
2 2480 Deuotion, Patience, Courage, Fortitude,
2 2481 I haue no rellish of them, but abound
2 2482 In the diuision of each seuerall Crime,
2 2483 Acting it many wayes. Nay, had I powre, I should
2 2484 Poure the sweet Milke of Concord, into Hell,
2 2485 Vprore the vniuersall peace, confound
2 2486 All vnity on earth
2 2487 
2 2488    Macd. O Scotland, Scotland
2 2489 
2 2490    Mal. If such a one be fit to gouerne, speake:
2 2491 I am as I haue spoken
2 2492 
2 2493    Mac. Fit to gouern? No not to liue. O Natio[n] miserable!
2 2494 With an vntitled Tyrant, bloody Sceptred,
2 2495 When shalt thou see thy wholsome dayes againe?
2 2496 Since that the truest Issue of thy Throne
2 2497 By his owne Interdiction stands accust,
2 2498 And do's blaspheme his breed? Thy Royall Father
2 2499 Was a most Sainted-King: the Queene that bore thee,
2 2500 Oftner vpon her knees, then on her feet,
2 2501 Dy'de euery day she liu'd. Fare thee well,
2 2502 These Euils thou repeat'st vpon thy selfe,
2 2503 Hath banish'd me from Scotland. O my Brest,
2 2504 Thy hope ends heere
2 2505 
2 2506    Mal. Macduff, this Noble passion
2 2507 Childe of integrity, hath from my soule
2 2508 Wip'd the blacke Scruples, reconcil'd my thoughts
2 2509 To thy good Truth, and Honor. Diuellish Macbeth,
2 2510 By many of these traines, hath sought to win me
2 2511 Into his power: and modest Wisedome pluckes me
2 2512 From ouer-credulous hast: but God aboue
2 2513 Deale betweene thee and me; For euen now
2 2514 I put my selfe to thy Direction, and
2 2515 Vnspeake mine owne detraction. Heere abiure
2 2516 The taints, and blames I laide vpon my selfe,
2 2517 For strangers to my Nature. I am yet
2 2518 Vnknowne to Woman, neuer was forsworne,
2 2519 Scarsely haue coueted what was mine owne.
2 2520 At no time broke my Faith, would not betray
2 2521 The Deuill to his Fellow, and delight
2 2522 No lesse in truth then life. My first false speaking
2 2523 Was this vpon my selfe. What I am truly
2 2524 Is thine, and my poore Countries to command:
2 2525 Whither indeed, before they heere approach
2 2526 Old Seyward with ten thousand warlike men
2 2527 Already at a point, was setting foorth:
2 2528 Now wee'l together, and the chance of goodnesse
2 2529 Be like our warranted Quarrell. Why are you silent?
2 2530   Macd. Such welcome, and vnwelcom things at once
2 2531 'Tis hard to reconcile.
2 2532 Enter a Doctor.
2 2533 
2 2534   Mal. Well, more anon. Comes the King forth
2 2535 I pray you?
2 2536   Doct. I Sir: there are a crew of wretched Soules
2 2537 That stay his Cure: their malady conuinces
2 2538 The great assay of Art. But at his touch,
2 2539 Such sanctity hath Heauen giuen his hand,
2 2540 They presently amend.
2 2541 Enter.
2 2542 
2 2543   Mal. I thanke you Doctor
2 2544 
2 2545    Macd. What's the Disease he meanes?
2 2546   Mal. Tis call'd the Euill.
2 2547 A most myraculous worke in this good King,
2 2548 Which often since my heere remaine in England,
2 2549 I haue seene him do: How he solicites heauen
2 2550 Himselfe best knowes: but strangely visited people
2 2551 All swolne and Vlcerous, pittifull to the eye,
2 2552 The meere dispaire of Surgery, he cures,
2 2553 Hanging a golden stampe about their neckes,
2 2554 Put on with holy Prayers, and 'tis spoken
2 2555 To the succeeding Royalty he leaues
2 2556 The healing Benediction. With this strange vertue,
2 2557 He hath a heauenly guift of Prophesie,
2 2558 And sundry Blessings hang about his Throne,
2 2559 That speake him full of Grace.
2 2560 Enter Rosse.
2 2561 
2 2562   Macd. See who comes heere
2 2563 
2 2564    Malc. My Countryman: but yet I know him not
2 2565 
2 2566    Macd. My euer gentle Cozen, welcome hither
2 2567 
2 2568    Malc. I know him now. Good God betimes remoue
2 2569 The meanes that makes vs Strangers
2 2570 
2 2571    Rosse. Sir, Amen
2 2572 
2 2573    Macd. Stands Scotland where it did?
2 2574   Rosse. Alas poore Countrey,
2 2575 Almost affraid to know it selfe. It cannot
2 2576 Be call'd our Mother, but our Graue; where nothing
2 2577 But who knowes nothing, is once seene to smile:
2 2578 Where sighes, and groanes, and shrieks that rent the ayre
2 2579 Are made, not mark'd: Where violent sorrow seemes
2 2580 A Moderne extasie: The Deadmans knell,
2 2581 Is there scarse ask'd for who, and good mens liues
2 2582 Expire before the Flowers in their Caps,
2 2583 Dying, or ere they sicken
2 2584 
2 2585    Macd. Oh Relation; too nice, and yet too true
2 2586 
2 2587    Malc. What's the newest griefe?
2 2588   Rosse. That of an houres age, doth hisse the speaker,
2 2589 Each minute teemes a new one
2 2590 
2 2591    Macd. How do's my Wife?
2 2592   Rosse. Why well
2 2593 
2 2594    Macd. And all my Children?
2 2595   Rosse. Well too
2 2596 
2 2597    Macd. The Tyrant ha's not batter'd at their peace?
2 2598   Rosse. No, they were wel at peace, when I did leaue 'em
2 2599   Macd. Be not a niggard of your speech: How gos't?
2 2600   Rosse. When I came hither to transport the Tydings
2 2601 Which I haue heauily borne, there ran a Rumour
2 2602 Of many worthy Fellowes, that were out,
2 2603 Which was to my beleefe witnest the rather,
2 2604 For that I saw the Tyrants Power a-foot.
2 2605 Now is the time of helpe: your eye in Scotland
2 2606 Would create Soldiours, make our women fight,
2 2607 To doffe their dire distresses
2 2608 
2 2609    Malc. Bee't their comfort
2 2610 We are comming thither: Gracious England hath
2 2611 Lent vs good Seyward, and ten thousand men,
2 2612 An older, and a better Souldier, none
2 2613 That Christendome giues out
2 2614 
2 2615    Rosse. Would I could answer
2 2616 This comfort with the like. But I haue words
2 2617 That would be howl'd out in the desert ayre,
2 2618 Where hearing should not latch them
2 2619 
2 2620    Macd. What concerne they,
2 2621 The generall cause, or is it a Fee-griefe
2 2622 Due to some single brest?
2 2623   Rosse. No minde that's honest
2 2624 But in it shares some woe, though the maine part
2 2625 Pertaines to you alone
2 2626 
2 2627    Macd. If it be mine
2 2628 Keepe it not from me, quickly let me haue it
2 2629 
2 2630    Rosse. Let not your eares dispise my tongue for euer,
2 2631 Which shall possesse them with the heauiest sound
2 2632 that euer yet they heard
2 2633 
2 2634    Macd. Humh: I guesse at it
2 2635 
2 2636    Rosse. Your Castle is surpriz'd: your Wife, and Babes
2 2637 Sauagely slaughter'd: To relate the manner
2 2638 Were on the Quarry of these murther'd Deere
2 2639 To adde the death of you
2 2640 
2 2641    Malc. Mercifull Heauen:
2 2642 What man, ne're pull your hat vpon your browes:
2 2643 Giue sorrow words; the griefe that do's not speake,
2 2644 Whispers the o're-fraught heart, and bids it breake
2 2645 
2 2646    Macd. My Children too?
2 2647   Ro. Wife, Children, Seruants, all that could be found
2 2648 
2 2649    Macd. And I must be from thence? My wife kil'd too?
2 2650   Rosse. I haue said
2 2651 
2 2652    Malc. Be comforted.
2 2653 Let's make vs Med'cines of our great Reuenge,
2 2654 To cure this deadly greefe
2 2655 
2 2656    Macd. He ha's no Children. All my pretty ones?
2 2657 Did you say All? Oh Hell-Kite! All?
2 2658 What, All my pretty Chickens, and their Damme
2 2659 At one fell swoope?
2 2660   Malc. Dispute it like a man
2 2661 
2 2662    Macd. I shall do so:
2 2663 But I must also feele it as a man;
2 2664 I cannot but remember such things were
2 2665 That were most precious to me: Did heauen looke on,
2 2666 And would not take their part? Sinfull Macduff,
2 2667 They were all strooke for thee: Naught that I am,
2 2668 Not for their owne demerits, but for mine
2 2669 Fell slaughter on their soules: Heauen rest them now
2 2670 
2 2671    Mal. Be this the Whetstone of your sword, let griefe
2 2672 Conuert to anger: blunt not the heart, enrage it
2 2673 
2 2674    Macd. O I could play the woman with mine eyes,
2 2675 And Braggart with my tongue. But gentle Heauens,
2 2676 Cut short all intermission: Front to Front,
2 2677 Bring thou this Fiend of Scotland, and my selfe
2 2678 Within my Swords length set him, if he scape
2 2679 Heauen forgiue him too
2 2680 
2 2681    Mal. This time goes manly:
2 2682 Come go we to the King, our Power is ready,
2 2683 Our lacke is nothing but our leaue. Macbeth
2 2684 Is ripe for shaking, and the Powres aboue
2 2685 Put on their Instruments: Receiue what cheere you may,
2 2686 The Night is long, that neuer findes the Day.
2 2687 
2 2688 Exeunt.
2 2689 
2 2690 Actus Quintus. Scena Prima.
2 2691 
2 2692 Enter a Doctor of Physicke, and a Wayting Gentlewoman.
2 2693 
2 2694   Doct. I haue too Nights watch'd with you, but can
2 2695 perceiue no truth in your report. When was it shee last
2 2696 walk'd?
2 2697   Gent. Since his Maiesty went into the Field, I haue
2 2698 seene her rise from her bed, throw her Night-Gown vppon
2 2699 her, vnlocke her Closset, take foorth paper, folde it,
2 2700 write vpon't, read it, afterwards Seale it, and againe returne
2 2701 to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleepe
2 2702 
2 2703    Doct. A great perturbation in Nature, to receyue at
2 2704 once the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of watching.
2 2705 In this slumbry agitation, besides her walking, and other
2 2706 actuall performances, what (at any time) haue you heard
2 2707 her say?
2 2708   Gent. That Sir, which I will not report after her
2 2709 
2 2710    Doct. You may to me, and 'tis most meet you should
2 2711 
2 2712    Gent. Neither to you, nor any one, hauing no witnesse
2 2713 to confirme my speech.
2 2714 Enter Lady, with a Taper.
2 2715 
2 2716 Lo you, heere she comes: This is her very guise, and vpon
2 2717 my life fast asleepe: obserue her, stand close
2 2718 
2 2719    Doct. How came she by that light?
2 2720   Gent. Why it stood by her: she ha's light by her continually,
2 2721 'tis her command
2 2722 
2 2723    Doct. You see her eyes are open
2 2724 
2 2725    Gent. I, but their sense are shut
2 2726 
2 2727    Doct. What is it she do's now?
2 2728 Looke how she rubbes her hands
2 2729 
2 2730    Gent. It is an accustom'd action with her, to seeme
2 2731 thus washing her hands: I haue knowne her continue in
2 2732 this a quarter of an houre
2 2733 
2 2734    Lad. Yet heere's a spot
2 2735 
2 2736    Doct. Heark, she speaks, I will set downe what comes
2 2737 from her, to satisfie my remembrance the more strongly
2 2738 
2 2739    La. Out damned spot: out I say. One: Two: Why
2 2740 then 'tis time to doo't: Hell is murky. Fye, my Lord, fie,
2 2741 a Souldier, and affear'd? what need we feare? who knowes
2 2742 it, when none can call our powre to accompt: yet who
2 2743 would haue thought the olde man to haue had so much
2 2744 blood in him
2 2745 
2 2746    Doct. Do you marke that?
2 2747   Lad. The Thane of Fife, had a wife: where is she now?
2 2748 What will these hands ne're be cleane? No more o'that
2 2749 my Lord, no more o'that: you marre all with this starting
2 2750 
2 2751    Doct. Go too, go too:
2 2752 You haue knowne what you should not
2 2753 
2 2754    Gent. She ha's spoke what shee should not, I am sure
2 2755 of that: Heauen knowes what she ha's knowne
2 2756 
2 2757    La. Heere's the smell of the blood still: all the perfumes
2 2758 of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand.
2 2759 Oh, oh, oh
2 2760 
2 2761    Doct. What a sigh is there? The hart is sorely charg'd
2 2762 
2 2763    Gent. I would not haue such a heart in my bosome,
2 2764 for the dignity of the whole body
2 2765 
2 2766    Doct. Well, well, well
2 2767 
2 2768    Gent. Pray God it be sir
2 2769 
2 2770    Doct. This disease is beyond my practise: yet I haue

2 2774    Lad. Wash your hands, put on your Night-Gowne,
2 2775 looke not so pale: I tell you yet againe Banquo's buried;
2 2776 he cannot come out on's graue
2 2777 
2 2778    Doct. Euen so?
2 2779   Lady. To bed, to bed: there's knocking at the gate:
2 2780 Come, come, come, come, giue me your hand: What's
2 2781 done, cannot be vndone. To bed, to bed, to bed.
2 2782 
2 2783 Exit Lady.
2 2784 
2 2785   Doct. Will she go now to bed?
2 2786   Gent. Directly
2 2787 
2 2788    Doct. Foule whisp'rings are abroad: vnnaturall deeds
2 2789 Do breed vnnaturall troubles: infected mindes
2 2790 To their deafe pillowes will discharge their Secrets:
2 2791 More needs she the Diuine, then the Physitian:
2 2792 God, God forgiue vs all. Looke after her,
2 2793 Remoue from her the meanes of all annoyance,
2 2794 And still keepe eyes vpon her: So goodnight,
2 2795 My minde she ha's mated, and amaz'd my sight.
2 2796 I thinke, but dare not speake

2 2811 Would to the bleeding, and the grim Alarme
2 2812 Excite the mortified man

2 2814    Ang. Neere Byrnan wood

2 2816 
2 2817    Cath. Who knowes if Donalbane be with his brother?
2 2818   Len. For certaine Sir, he is not: I haue a File
2 2819 Of all the Gentry; there is Seywards Sonne,
2 2820 And many vnruffe youths, that euen now
2 2821 Protest their first of Manhood
2 2822 
2 2823    Ment. What do's the Tyrant
2 2824 
2 2825    Cath. Great Dunsinane he strongly Fortifies:
2 2826 Some say hee's mad: Others, that lesser hate him,
2 2827 Do call it valiant Fury, but for certaine
2 2828 He cannot buckle his distemper'd cause
2 2829 Within the belt of Rule
2 2830 
2 2831    Ang. Now do's he feele
2 2832 His secret Murthers sticking on his hands,
2 2833 Now minutely Reuolts vpbraid his Faith-breach:
2 2834 Those he commands, moue onely in command,
2 2835 Nothing in loue: Now do's he feele his Title
2 2836 Hang loose about him, like a Giants Robe
2 2837 Vpon a dwarfish Theefe
2 2838 
2 2839    Ment. Who then shall blame
2 2840 His pester'd Senses to recoyle, and start,
2 2841 When all that is within him, do's condemne
2 2842 It selfe, for being there
2 2843 
2 2844    Cath. Well, march we on,
2 2845 To giue Obedience, where 'tis truly ow'd:
2 2846 Meet we the Med'cine of the sickly Weale,
2 2847 And with him poure we in our Countries purge,

2 2861   Macb. Bring me no more Reports, let them flye all:
2 2862 Till Byrnane wood remoue to Dunsinane,
2 2863 I cannot taint with Feare. What's the Boy Malcolme?
2 2864 Was he not borne of woman? The Spirits that know
2 2865 All mortall Consequences, haue pronounc'd me thus:
2 2866 Feare not Macbeth, no man that's borne of woman
2 2867 Shall ere haue power vpon thee. Then fly false Thanes,
2 2868 And mingle with the English Epicures,
2 2869 The minde I sway by, and the heart I beare,
2 2870 Shall neuer sagge with doubt, nor shake with feare.
2 2871 Enter Seruant.

2 2878    Macb. Geese Villaine?
2 2879   Ser. Souldiers Sir
2 2880 
2 2881    Macb. Go pricke thy face, and ouer-red thy feare
2 2882 Thou Lilly-liuer'd Boy. What Soldiers, Patch?
2 2883 Death of thy Soule, those Linnen cheekes of thine
2 2884 Are Counsailers to feare. What Soldiers Whay-face?
2 2885   Ser. The English Force, so please you
2 2886 
2 2887    Macb. Take thy face hence. Seyton, I am sick at hart,
2 2888 When I behold: Seyton, I say, this push
2 2889 Will cheere me euer, or dis-eate me now.
2 2890 I haue liu'd long enough: my way of life
2 2891 Is falne into the Seare, the yellow Leafe,
2 2892 And that which should accompany Old-Age,
2 2893 As Honor, Loue, Obedience, Troopes of Friends,
2 2894 I must not looke to haue: but in their steed,
2 2895 Curses, not lowd but deepe, Mouth-honor, breath
2 2896 Which the poore heart would faine deny, and dare not.
2 2897 Seyton?
2 2898 Enter Seyton.
2 2899 
2 2900   Sey. What's your gracious pleasure?
2 2901   Macb. What Newes more?
2 2902   Sey. All is confirm'd my Lord, which was reported
2 2903 
2 2904    Macb. Ile fight, till from my bones, my flesh be hackt.
2 2905 Giue me my Armor
2 2906 
2 2907    Seyt. 'Tis not needed yet
2 2908 
2 2909    Macb. Ile put it on:
2 2910 Send out moe Horses, skirre the Country round,
2 2911 Hang those that talke of Feare. Giue me mine Armor:
2 2912 How do's your Patient, Doctor?
2 2913   Doct. Not so sicke my Lord,
2 2914 As she is troubled with thicke-comming Fancies
2 2915 That keepe her from her rest
2 2916 
2 2917    Macb. Cure of that:
2 2918 Can'st thou not Minister to a minde diseas'd,
2 2919 Plucke from the Memory a rooted Sorrow,
2 2920 Raze out the written troubles of the Braine,
2 2921 And with some sweet Obliuious Antidote
2 2922 Cleanse the stufft bosome, of that perillous stuffe
2 2923 Which weighes vpon the heart?
2 2924   Doct. Therein the Patient
2 2925 Must minister to himselfe
2 2926 
2 2927    Macb. Throw Physicke to the Dogs, Ile none of it.
2 2928 Come, put mine Armour on: giue me my Staffe:
2 2929 Seyton, send out: Doctor, the Thanes flye from me:
2 2930 Come sir, dispatch. If thou could'st Doctor, cast
2 2931 The Water of my Land, finde her Disease,
2 2932 And purge it to a sound and pristine Health,
2 2933 I would applaud thee to the very Eccho,
2 2934 That should applaud againe. Pull't off I say,
2 2935 What Rubarb, Cyme, or what Purgatiue drugge
2 2936 Would scowre these English hence: hear'st y of them?
2 2937   Doct. I my good Lord: your Royall Preparation
2 2938 Makes vs heare something
2 2939 
2 2940    Macb. Bring it after me:
2 2941 I will not be affraid of Death and Bane,
2 2942 Till Birnane Forrest come to Dunsinane
2 2943 
2 2944    Doct. Were I from Dunsinane away, and cleere,

2 2965 The numbers of our Hoast, and make discouery
2 2966 Erre in report of vs

2 2971 Keepes still in Dunsinane, and will indure
2 2972 Our setting downe befor't

2 2974    Malc. 'Tis his maine hope:
2 2975 For where there is aduantage to be giuen,
2 2976 Both more and lesse haue giuen him the Reuolt,
2 2977 And none serue with him, but constrained things,
2 2978 Whose hearts are absent too
2 2979

2 2981 Attend the true euent, and put we on

2 2983 
2 2984    Sey. The time approaches,
2 2985 That will with due decision make vs know
2 2986 What we shall say we haue, and what we owe:

2 2997   Macb. Hang out our Banners on the outward walls,
2 2998 The Cry is still, they come: our Castles strength
2 2999 Will laugh a Siedge to scorne: Heere let them lye,
2 3000 Till Famine and the Ague eate them vp:
2 3001 Were they not forc'd with those that should be ours,
2 3002 We might haue met them darefull, beard to beard,
2 3003 And beate them backward home. What is that noyse?
2 3004 
2 3005 A Cry within of Women.
2 3006 
2 3007   Sey. It is the cry of women, my good Lord
2 3008 
2 3009    Macb. I haue almost forgot the taste of Feares:
2 3010 The time ha's beene, my sences would haue cool'd
2 3011 To heare a Night-shrieke, and my Fell of haire
2 3012 Would at a dismall Treatise rowze, and stirre
2 3013 As life were in't. I haue supt full with horrors,
2 3014 Direnesse familiar to my slaughterous thoughts
2 3015 Cannot once start me. Wherefore was that cry?
2 3016   Sey. The Queene (my Lord) is dead
2 3017 
2 3018    Macb. She should haue dy'de heereafter;
2 3019 There would haue beene a time for such a word:
2 3020 To morrow, and to morrow, and to morrow,
2 3021 Creepes in this petty pace from day to day,
2 3022 To the last Syllable of Recorded time:
2 3023 And all our yesterdayes, haue lighted Fooles
2 3024 The way to dusty death. Out, out, breefe Candle,
2 3025 Life's but a walking Shadow, a poore Player,
2 3026 That struts and frets his houre vpon the Stage,
2 3027 And then is heard no more. It is a Tale
2 3028 Told by an Ideot, full of sound and fury
2 3029 Signifying nothing.
2 3030 Enter a Messenger.
2 3031 
2 3032 Thou com'st to vse thy Tongue: thy Story quickly
2 3033 
2 3034    Mes. Gracious my Lord,
2 3035 I should report that which I say I saw,
2 3036 But know not how to doo't
2 3037 
2 3038    Macb. Well, say sir
2 3039 
2 3040    Mes. As I did stand my watch vpon the Hill
2 3041 I look'd toward Byrnane, and anon me thought
2 3042 The Wood began to moue
2 3043 
2 3044    Macb. Lyar, and Slaue
2 3045 
2 3046    Mes. Let me endure your wrath, if't be not so:
2 3047 Within this three Mile may you see it comming.
2 3048 I say, a mouing Groue
2 3049 
2 3050    Macb. If thou speak'st false,
2 3051 Vpon the next Tree shall thou hang aliue
2 3052 Till Famine cling thee: If thy speech be sooth,
2 3053 I care not if thou dost for me as much.
2 3054 I pull in Resolution, and begin
2 3055 To doubt th' Equiuocation of the Fiend,
2 3056 That lies like truth. Feare not, till Byrnane Wood
2 3057 Do come to Dunsinane, and now a Wood
2 3058 Comes toward Dunsinane. Arme, Arme, and out,
2 3059 If this which he auouches, do's appeare,
2 3060 There is nor flying hence, nor tarrying here.
2 3061 I 'ginne to be a-weary of the Sun,
2 3062 And wish th' estate o'th' world were now vndon.
2 3063 Ring the Alarum Bell, blow Winde, come wracke,
2 3064 At least wee'l dye with Harnesse on our backe.

2 3075 Your leauy Skreenes throw downe,
2 3076 And shew like those you are: You (worthy Vnkle)
2 3077 Shall with my Cosin your right Noble Sonne
2 3078 Leade our first Battell. Worthy Macduffe, and wee
2 3079 Shall take vpon's what else remaines to do,
2 3080 According to our order
2 3081 
2 3082    Sey. Fare you well:
2 3083 Do we but finde the Tyrants power to night,
2 3084 Let vs be beaten, if we cannot fight
2 3085 
2 3086    Macd. Make all our Trumpets speak, giue the[m] all breath

2 3100 That was not borne of Woman? Such a one
2 3101 Am I to feare, or none.
2 3102 Enter young Seyward.
2 3103

2 3105   Macb. Thou'lt be affraid to heare it
2 3106 
2 3107    Y.Sey. No: though thou call'st thy selfe a hoter name
2 3108 Then any is in hell
2 3109 
2 3110    Macb. My name's Macbeth
2 3111 
2 3112    Y.Sey. The diuell himselfe could not pronounce a Title
2 3113 More hatefull to mine eare
2 3114 
2 3115    Macb. No: nor more fearefull
2 3116 
2 3117    Y.Sey. Thou lyest abhorred Tyrant, with my Sword
2 3118 Ile proue the lye thou speak'st.
2 3119 
2 3120 Fight, and young Seyward slaine.
2 3121 
2 3122   Macb. Thou was't borne of woman;
2 3123 But Swords I smile at, Weapons laugh to scorne,
2 3124 Brandish'd by man that's of a Woman borne.
2 3125 Enter.

2 3130 If thou beest slaine, and with no stroake of mine,
2 3131 My Wife and Childrens Ghosts will haunt me still:
2 3132 I cannot strike at wretched Kernes, whose armes
2 3133 Are hyr'd to beare their Staues; either thou Macbeth,
2 3134 Or else my Sword with an vnbattered edge
2 3135 I sheath againe vndeeded. There thou should'st be,
2 3136 By this great clatter, one of greatest note
2 3137 Seemes bruited. Let me finde him Fortune,
2 3138 And more I begge not.

2 3143 
2 3144   Sey. This way my Lord, the Castles gently rendred:
2 3145 The Tyrants people, on both sides do fight,
2 3146 The Noble Thanes do brauely in the Warre,
2 3147 The day almost it selfe professes yours,
2 3148 And little is to do

2 3167 But get thee backe, my soule is too much charg'd
2 3168 With blood of thine already
2 3169 
2 3170    Macd. I haue no words,
2 3171 My voice is in my Sword, thou bloodier Villaine
2 3172 Then tearmes can giue thee out.
2 3173 
2 3174 Fight: Alarum
2 3175 
2 3176   Macb. Thou loosest labour
2 3177 As easie may'st thou the intrenchant Ayre
2 3178 With thy keene Sword impresse, as make me bleed:
2 3179 Let fall thy blade on vulnerable Crests,
2 3180 I beare a charmed Life, which must not yeeld
2 3181 To one of woman borne
2 3182 
2 3183    Macd. Dispaire thy Charme,
2 3184 And let the Angell whom thou still hast seru'd
2 3185 Tell thee, Macduffe was from his Mothers womb
2 3186 Vntimely ript
2 3187 
2 3188    Macb. Accursed be that tongue that tels mee so;
2 3189 For it hath Cow'd my better part of man:
2 3190 And be these Iugling Fiends no more beleeu'd,
2 3191 That palter with vs in a double sence,
2 3192 That keepe the word of promise to our eare,
2 3193 And breake it to our hope. Ile not fight with thee
2 3194

2 3197 Wee'l haue thee, as our rarer Monsters are
2 3198 Painted vpon a pole, and vnder-writ,
2 3199 Heere may you see the Tyrant
2 3200 
2 3201    Macb. I will not yeeld
2 3202 To kisse the ground before young Malcolmes feet,
2 3203 And to be baited with the Rabbles curse.
2 3204 Though Byrnane wood be come to Dunsinane,
2 3205 And thou oppos'd, being of no woman borne,
2 3206 Yet I will try the last. Before my body,

2 3221 So great a day as this is cheapely bought
2 3222 
2 3223    Mal. Macduffe is missing, and your Noble Sonne

2 3226 He onely liu'd but till he was a man,
2 3227 The which no sooner had his Prowesse confirm'd
2 3228 In the vnshrinking station where he fought,
2 3229 But like a man he dy'de
2 3230 
2 3231    Sey. Then he is dead?
2 3232   Rosse. I, and brought off the field: your cause of sorrow
2 3233 Must not be measur'd by his worth, for then
2 3234 It hath no end
2 3235 
2 3236    Sey. Had he his hurts before?
2 3237   Rosse. I, on the Front
2 3238 
2 3239    Sey. Why then, Gods Soldier be he:
2 3240 Had I as many Sonnes, as I haue haires,
2 3241 I would not wish them to a fairer death:
2 3242 And so his Knell is knoll'd
2 3243 
2 3244    Mal. Hee's worth more sorrow,
2 3245 and that Ile spend for him
2 3246 
2 3247    Sey. He's worth no more,
2 3248 They say he parted well, and paid his score,
2 3249 And so God be with him. Here comes newer comfort.
2 3250 Enter Macduffe, with Macbeths head.
2 3251 
2 3252   Macd. Haile King, for so thou art.
2 3253 Behold where stands
2 3254 Th' Vsurpers cursed head: the time is free:
2 3255 I see thee compast with thy Kingdomes Pearle,
2 3256 That speake my salutation in their minds:
2 3257 Whose voyces I desire alowd with mine.
2 3258 Haile King of Scotland
2 3259 
2 3260    All. Haile King of Scotland.
2 3261 
2 3262 Flourish.
2 3263 
2 3264   Mal. We shall not spend a large expence of time,
2 3265 Before we reckon with your seuerall loues,
2 3266 And make vs euen with you. My Thanes and Kinsmen
2 3267 Henceforth be Earles, the first that euer Scotland
2 3268 In such an Honor nam'd: What's more to do,
2 3269 Which would be planted newly with the time,
2 3270 As calling home our exil'd Friends abroad,
2 3271 That fled the Snares of watchfull Tyranny,
2 3272 Producing forth the cruell Ministers
2 3273 Of this dead Butcher, and his Fiend-like Queene;
2 3274 Who (as 'tis thought) by selfe and violent hands,
2 3275 Tooke off her life. This, and what need full else
2 3276 That call's vpon vs, by the Grace of Grace,
2 3277 We will performe in measure, time, and place:
2 3278 So thankes to all at once, and to each one,
2 3279 Whom we inuite, to see vs Crown'd at Scone.
2 3280 
2 3281 Flourish. Exeunt Omnes.
2 3282 
2 3283 
2 3284 FINIS. THE TRAGEDIE OF MACBETH.
