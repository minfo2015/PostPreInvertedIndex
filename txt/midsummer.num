11 0 ï»¿A Midsommer Nights Dreame
11 1 
11 2 Actus primus.
11 3 
11 4 Enter Theseus, Hippolita, with others.
11 5 
11 6   Theseus. Now faire Hippolita, our nuptiall houre
11 7 Drawes on apace: foure happy daies bring in
11 8 Another Moon: but oh, me thinkes, how slow
11 9 This old Moon wanes; She lingers my desires
11 10 Like to a Step-dame, or a Dowager,
11 11 Long withering out a yong mans reuennew
11 12 
11 13    Hip. Foure daies wil quickly steep the[m]selues in nights
11 14 Foure nights wil quickly dreame away the time:
11 15 And then the Moone, like to a siluer bow,
11 16 Now bent in heauen, shal behold the night
11 17 Of our solemnities
11 18 
11 19    The. Go Philostrate,
11 20 Stirre vp the Athenian youth to merriments,
11 21 Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth,
11 22 Turne melancholy forth to Funerals:
11 23 The pale companion is not for our pompe,
11 24 Hippolita, I woo'd thee with my sword,
11 25 And wonne thy loue, doing thee iniuries:
11 26 But I will wed thee in another key,
11 27 With pompe, with triumph, and with reuelling.
11 28 Enter Egeus and his daughter Hermia, Lysander, and Demetrius.
11 29 
11 30   Ege. Happy be Theseus, our renowned Duke
11 31 
11 32    The. Thanks good Egeus: what's the news with thee?
11 33   Ege. Full of vexation, come I, with complaint
11 34 Against my childe, my daughter Hermia.
11 35 
11 36 Stand forth Demetrius.
11 37 
11 38 My Noble Lord,
11 39 This man hath my consent to marrie her.
11 40 
11 41 Stand forth Lysander.
11 42 
11 43 And my gracious Duke,
11 44 This man hath bewitch'd the bosome of my childe:
11 45 Thou, thou Lysander, thou hast giuen her rimes,
11 46 And interchang'd loue-tokens with my childe:
11 47 Thou hast by Moone-light at her window sung,
11 48 With faining voice, verses of faining loue,
11 49 And stolne the impression of her fantasie,
11 50 With bracelets of thy haire, rings, gawdes, conceits,
11 51 Knackes, trifles, Nose-gaies, sweet meats (messengers
11 52 Of strong preuailment in vnhardned youth)
11 53 With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughters heart,
11 54 Turn'd her obedience (which is due to me)
11 55 To stubborne harshnesse. And my gracious Duke,
11 56 Be it so she will not heere before your Grace,
11 57 Consent to marrie with Demetrius,
11 58 I beg the ancient priuiledge of Athens;
11 59 As she is mine, I may dispose of her;
11 60 Which shall be either to this Gentleman,
11 61 Or to her death, according to our Law,
11 62 Immediately prouided in that case
11 63 
11 64    The. What say you Hermia? be aduis'd faire Maide,
11 65 To you your Father should be as a God;
11 66 One that compos'd your beauties; yea and one
11 67 To whom you are but as a forme in waxe
11 68 By him imprinted: and within his power,
11 69 To leaue the figure, or disfigure it:
11 70 Demetrius is a worthy Gentleman
11 71 
11 72    Her. So is Lysander
11 73 
11 74    The. In himselfe he is.
11 75 But in this kinde, wanting your fathers voyce,
11 76 The other must be held the worthier
11 77 
11 78    Her. I would my father look'd but with my eyes
11 79 
11 80    The. Rather your eies must with his iudgment looke
11 81 
11 82    Her. I do entreat your Grace to pardon me.
11 83 I know not by what power I am made bold,
11 84 Nor how it may concerne my modestie
11 85 In such a presence heere to pleade my thoughts:
11 86 But I beseech your Grace, that I may know
11 87 The worst that may befall me in this case,
11 88 If I refuse to wed Demetrius
11 89 
11 90    The. Either to dye the death, or to abiure
11 91 For euer the society of men.
11 92 Therefore faire Hermia question your desires,
11 93 Know of your youth, examine well your blood,
11 94 Whether (if you yeeld not to your fathers choice)
11 95 You can endure the liuerie of a Nunne,
11 96 For aye to be in shady Cloister mew'd,
11 97 To liue a barren sister all your life,
11 98 Chanting faint hymnes to the cold fruitlesse Moone,
11 99 Thrice blessed they that master so their blood,
11 100 To vndergo such maiden pilgrimage,
11 101 But earthlier happie is the Rose distil'd,
11 102 Then that which withering on the virgin thorne,
11 103 Growes, liues, and dies, in single blessednesse
11 104 
11 105    Her. So will I grow, so liue, so die my Lord,
11 106 Ere I will yeeld my virgin Patent vp
11 107 Vnto his Lordship, whose vnwished yoake,
11 108 My soule consents not to giue soueraignty
11 109 
11 110    The. Take time to pause, and by the next new Moon
11 111 The sealing day betwixt my loue and me,
11 112 For euerlasting bond of fellowship:
11 113 Vpon that day either prepare to dye,
11 114 For disobedience to your fathers will,
11 115 Or else to wed Demetrius as hee would,
11 116 Or on Dianaes Altar to protest
11 117 For aie, austerity, and single life
11 118 
11 119    Dem. Relent sweet Hermia, and Lysander, yeelde
11 120 Thy crazed title to my certaine right
11 121 
11 122    Lys. You haue her fathers loue, Demetrius:
11 123 Let me haue Hermiaes: do you marry him
11 124 
11 125    Egeus. Scornfull Lysander, true, he hath my Loue;
11 126 And what is mine, my loue shall render him.
11 127 And she is mine, and all my right of her,
11 128 I do estate vnto Demetrius
11 129 
11 130    Lys. I am my Lord, as well deriu'd as he,
11 131 As well possest: my loue is more then his:
11 132 My fortunes euery way as fairely ranck'd
11 133 (If not with vantage) as Demetrius:
11 134 And (which is more then all these boasts can be)
11 135 I am belou'd of beauteous Hermia.
11 136 Why should not I then prosecute my right?
11 137 Demetrius, Ile auouch it to his head,
11 138 Made loue to Nedars daughter, Helena,
11 139 And won her soule: and she (sweet Ladie) dotes,
11 140 Deuoutly dotes, dotes in Idolatry,
11 141 Vpon this spotted and inconstant man
11 142 
11 143    The. I must confesse, that I haue heard so much,
11 144 And with Demetrius thought to haue spoke thereof:
11 145 But being ouer-full of selfe-affaires,
11 146 My minde did lose it. But Demetrius come,
11 147 And come Egeus, you shall go with me,
11 148 I haue some priuate schooling for you both.
11 149 For you faire Hermia, looke you arme your selfe,
11 150 To fit your fancies to your Fathers will;
11 151 Or else the Law of Athens yeelds you vp
11 152 (Which by no meanes we may extenuate)
11 153 To death, or to a vow of single life.
11 154 Come my Hippolita, what cheare my loue?
11 155 Demetrius and Egeus go along:
11 156 I must imploy you in some businesse
11 157 Against our nuptiall, and conferre with you
11 158 Of something, neerely that concernes your selues
11 159 
11 160    Ege. With dutie and desire we follow you.
11 161 
11 162 Exeunt.
11 163 
11 164 Manet Lysander and Hermia.
11 165 
11 166   Lys. How now my loue? Why is your cheek so pale?
11 167 How chance the Roses there do fade so fast?
11 168   Her. Belike for want of raine, which I could well
11 169 Beteeme them, from the tempest of mine eyes
11 170 
11 171    Lys. For ought that euer I could reade,
11 172 Could euer heare by tale or historie,
11 173 The course of true loue neuer did run smooth,
11 174 But either it was different in blood
11 175 
11 176    Her. O crosse! too high to be enthral'd to loue
11 177 
11 178    Lys. Or else misgraffed, in respect of yeares
11 179 
11 180    Her. O spight! too old to be ingag'd to yong
11 181 
11 182    Lys. Or else it stood vpon the choise of merit
11 183 
11 184    Her. O hell! to choose loue by anothers eie
11 185 
11 186    Lys. Or if there were a simpathie in choise,
11 187 Warre, death, or sicknesse, did lay siege to it;
11 188 Making it momentarie, as a sound:
11 189 Swift as a shadow, short as any dreame,
11 190 Briefe as the lightning in the collied night,
11 191 That (in a spleene) vnfolds both heauen and earth;
11 192 And ere a man hath power to say, behold,
11 193 The iawes of darkness do deuoure it vp:
11 194 So quicke bright things come to confusion
11 195 
11 196    Her. If then true Louers haue beene euer crost,
11 197 It stands as an edict in destinie:
11 198 Then let vs teach our triall patience,
11 199 Because it is a customarie crosse,
11 200 As due to loue, as thoughts, and dreames, and sighes,
11 201 Wishes and teares; poore Fancies followers
11 202 
11 203    Lys. A good perswasion; therefore heare me Hermia,
11 204 I haue a Widdow Aunt, a dowager,
11 205 Of great reuennew, and she hath no childe,
11 206 From Athens is her house remou'd seuen leagues,
11 207 And she respects me, as her onely sonne:
11 208 There gentle Hermia, may I marrie thee,
11 209 And to that place, the sharpe Athenian Law
11 210 Cannot pursue vs. If thou lou'st me, then
11 211 Steale forth thy Fathers house to morrow night:
11 212 And in the wood, a league without the towne,
11 213 (Where I did meete thee once with Helena.
11 214 To do obseruance for a morne of May)
11 215 There will I stay for thee
11 216 
11 217    Her. My good Lysander,
11 218 I sweare to thee, by Cupids strongest bow,
11 219 By his best arrow with the golden head,
11 220 By the simplicitie of Venus Doues,
11 221 By that which knitteth soules, and prospers loue,
11 222 And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage Queene,
11 223 When the false Troyan vnder saile was seene,
11 224 By all the vowes that euer men haue broke,
11 225 (In number more then euer women spoke)
11 226 In that same place thou hast appointed me,
11 227 To morrow truly will I meete with thee
11 228 
11 229    Lys. Keepe promise loue: looke here comes Helena.
11 230 Enter Helena.
11 231 
11 232   Her. God speede faire Helena, whither away?
11 233   Hel. Cal you me faire? that faire againe vnsay,
11 234 Demetrius loues you faire: O happie faire!
11 235 Your eyes are loadstarres, and your tongues sweete ayre
11 236 More tuneable then Larke to shepheards eare,
11 237 When wheate is greene, when hauthorne buds appeare,
11 238 Sicknesse is catching: O were fauor so,
11 239 Your words I catch, faire Hermia ere I go,
11 240 My eare should catch your voice, my eye, your eye,
11 241 My tongue should catch your tongues sweete melodie,
11 242 Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,
11 243 The rest Ile giue to be to you translated.
11 244 O teach me how you looke, and with what art
11 245 You sway the motion of Demetrius hart
11 246 
11 247    Her. I frowne vpon him, yet he loues me still
11 248 
11 249    Hel. O that your frownes would teach my smiles
11 250 such skil
11 251 
11 252    Her. I giue him curses, yet he giues me loue
11 253 
11 254    Hel. O that my prayers could such affection mooue
11 255 
11 256    Her. The more I hate, the more he followes me
11 257 
11 258    Hel. The more I loue, the more he hateth me
11 259 
11 260    Her. His folly Helena is none of mine
11 261 
11 262    Hel. None but your beauty, wold that fault wer mine
11 263   Her. Take comfort: he no more shall see my face,
11 264 Lysander and my selfe will flie this place.
11 265 Before the time I did Lysander see,
11 266 Seem'd Athens like a Paradise to mee.
11 267 O then, what graces in my Loue do dwell,
11 268 That he hath turn'd a heauen into hell
11 269 
11 270    Lys. Helen, to you our mindes we will vnfold,
11 271 To morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold
11 272 Her siluer visage, in the watry glasse,
11 273 Decking with liquid pearle, the bladed grasse
11 274 (A time that Louers flights doth still conceale)
11 275 Through Athens gates, haue we deuis'd to steale
11 276 
11 277    Her. And in the wood, where often you and I,
11 278 Vpon faint Primrose beds, were wont to lye,
11 279 Emptying our bosomes, of their counsell sweld:
11 280 There my Lysander, and my selfe shall meete,
11 281 And thence from Athens turne away our eyes
11 282 To seeke new friends and strange companions,
11 283 Farwell sweet play-fellow, pray thou for vs,
11 284 And good lucke grant thee thy Demetrius.
11 285 Keepe word Lysander we must starue our sight,
11 286 From louers foode, till morrow deepe midnight.
11 287 
11 288 Exit Hermia.
11 289 
11 290   Lys. I will my Hermia. Helena adieu,
11 291 As you on him, Demetrius dotes on you.
11 292 
11 293 Exit Lysander.
11 294 
11 295   Hele. How happy some, ore othersome can be?
11 296 Through Athens I am thought as faire as she.
11 297 But what of that? Demetrius thinkes not so:
11 298 He will not know, what all, but he doth know,
11 299 And as hee erres, doting on Hermias eyes;
11 300 So I, admiring of his qualities:
11 301 Things base and vilde, holding no quantity,
11 302 Loue can transpose to forme and dignity,
11 303 Loue lookes not with the eyes, but with the minde,
11 304 And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blinde.
11 305 Nor hath loues minde of any iudgement taste:
11 306 Wings and no eyes, figure, vnheedy haste.
11 307 And therefore is Loue said to be a childe,
11 308 Because in choise he is often beguil'd,
11 309 As waggish boyes in game themselues forsweare;
11 310 So the boy Loue is periur'd euery where.
11 311 For ere Demetrius lookt on Hermias eyne,
11 312 He hail'd downe oathes that he was onely mine.
11 313 And when this Haile some heat from Hermia felt,
11 314 So he dissolu'd, and showres of oathes did melt,
11 315 I will goe tell him of faire Hermias flight:
11 316 Then to the wood will he, to morrow night
11 317 Pursue her; and for his intelligence,
11 318 If I haue thankes, it is a deere expence:
11 319 But heerein meane I to enrich my paine,
11 320 To haue his sight thither, and backe againe.
11 321 Enter.
11 322 
11 323 Enter Quince the Carpenter, Snug the Ioyner, Bottome the Weauer,
11 324 Flute
11 325 the bellowes-mender, Snout the Tinker, and Starueling the Taylor.
11 326 
11 327   Quin. Is all our company heere?
11 328   Bot. You were best to call them generally, man by
11 329 man according to the scrip
11 330 
11 331    Qui. Here is the scrowle of euery mans name, which
11 332 is thought fit through all Athens, to play in our Enterlude
11 333 before the Duke and the Dutches, on his wedding
11 334 day at night
11 335 
11 336    Bot. First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats
11 337 on: then read the names of the Actors: and so grow on
11 338 to a point
11 339 
11 340    Quin. Marry our play is the most lamentable comedy,
11 341 and most cruell death of Pyramus and Thisbie
11 342 
11 343    Bot. A very good peece of worke I assure you, and a
11 344 merry. Now good Peter Quince, call forth your Actors
11 345 by the scrowle. Masters spread your selues
11 346 
11 347    Quince. Answere as I call you. Nick Bottome the
11 348 Weauer
11 349 
11 350    Bottome. Ready; name what part I am for, and
11 351 proceed
11 352 
11 353    Quince. You Nicke Bottome are set downe for Pyramus
11 354 
11 355    Bot. What is Pyramus, a louer, or a tyrant?
11 356   Quin. A Louer that kills himselfe most gallantly for
11 357 loue
11 358 
11 359    Bot. That will aske some teares in the true performing
11 360 of it: if I do it, let the audience looke to their eies:
11 361 I will mooue stormes; I will condole in some measure.
11 362 To the rest yet, my chiefe humour is for a tyrant. I could
11 363 play Ercles rarely, or a part to teare a Cat in, to make all
11 364 split the raging Rocks; and shiuering shocks shall break
11 365 the locks of prison gates, and Phibbus carre shall shine
11 366 from farre, and make and marre the foolish Fates. This
11 367 was lofty. Now name the rest of the Players. This
11 368 is Ercles vaine, a tyrants vaine: a louer is more condoling
11 369 
11 370    Quin. Francis Flute the Bellowes-mender
11 371 
11 372    Flu. Heere Peter Quince
11 373 
11 374    Quin. You must take Thisbie on you
11 375 
11 376    Flut. What is Thisbie, a wandring Knight?
11 377   Quin. It is the Lady that Pyramus must loue
11 378 
11 379    Flut. Nay faith, let not mee play a woman, I haue a
11 380 beard comming
11 381 
11 382    Qui. That's all one, you shall play it in a Maske, and
11 383 you may speake as small as you will
11 384 
11 385    Bot. And I may hide my face, let me play Thisbie too:
11 386 Ile speake in a monstrous little voyce; Thisne, Thisne, ah
11 387 Pyramus my louer deare, thy Thisbie deare, and Lady
11 388 deare
11 389 
11 390    Quin. No no, you must play Pyramus, and Flute, you
11 391 Thisby
11 392 
11 393    Bot. Well, proceed
11 394 
11 395    Qu. Robin Starueling the Taylor
11 396 
11 397    Star. Heere Peter Quince
11 398 
11 399    Quince. Robin Starueling, you must play Thisbies
11 400 mother?
11 401 Tom Snowt, the Tinker
11 402 
11 403    Snowt. Heere Peter Quince
11 404 
11 405    Quin. you, Pyramus father; my self, Thisbies father;
11 406 Snugge the Ioyner, you the Lyons part: and I hope there
11 407 is a play fitted
11 408 
11 409    Snug. Haue you the Lions part written? pray you if
11 410 be, giue it me, for I am slow of studie
11 411 
11 412    Quin. You may doe it extemporie, for it is nothing
11 413 but roaring
11 414 
11 415    Bot. Let mee play the Lyon too, I will roare that I
11 416 will doe any mans heart good to heare me. I will roare,
11 417 that I will make the Duke say, Let him roare againe, let
11 418 him roare againe
11 419 
11 420    Quin. If you should do it too terribly, you would
11 421 fright the Dutchesse and the Ladies, that they would
11 422 shrike, and that were enough to hang us all
11 423 
11 424    All. That would hang vs euery mothers sonne
11 425 
11 426    Bottome. I graunt you friends, if that you should
11 427 fright the Ladies out of their Wittes, they would
11 428 haue no more discretion but to hang vs: but I will aggrauate
11 429 my voyce so, that I will roare you as gently as
11 430 any sucking Doue; I will roare and 'twere any Nightingale
11 431 
11 432    Quin. You can play no part but Piramus, for Piramus
11 433 is a sweet-fac'd man, a proper man as one shall see in
11 434 a summers day; a most louely Gentleman-like man, therfore
11 435 you must needs play Piramus
11 436 
11 437    Bot. Well, I will vndertake it. What beard were I
11 438 best to play it in?
11 439   Quin. Why, what you will
11 440 
11 441    Bot. I will discharge it, in either your straw-colour
11 442 beard, your orange tawnie beard, your purple in graine
11 443 beard, or your French-crowne colour'd beard, your perfect
11 444 yellow
11 445 
11 446    Quin. Some of your French Crownes haue no haire
11 447 at all, and then you will play bare-fac'd. But masters here
11 448 are your parts, and I am to intreat you, request you, and
11 449 desire you, to con them by too morrow night: and meet
11 450 me in the palace wood, a mile without the Towne, by
11 451 Moone-light, there we will rehearse: for if we meete in
11 452 the Citie, we shalbe dog'd with company, and our deuises
11 453 knowne. In the meane time, I wil draw a bil of properties,
11 454 such as our play wants. I pray you faile me not
11 455 
11 456    Bottom. We will meete, and there we may rehearse
11 457 more obscenely and couragiously. Take paines, be perfect,
11 458 adieu
11 459 
11 460    Quin. At the Dukes oake we meete
11 461 
11 462    Bot. Enough, hold or cut bow-strings.
11 463 
11 464 Exeunt.
11 465 
11 466 Actus Secundus.
11 467 
11 468 Enter a Fairie at one dore, and Robin goodfellow at another.
11 469 
11 470   Rob. How now spirit, whether wander you?
11 471   Fai. Ouer hil, ouer dale, through bush, through briar,
11 472 Ouer parke, ouer pale, through flood, through fire,
11 473 I do wander euerie where, swifter then y Moons sphere;
11 474 And I serue the Fairy Queene, to dew her orbs vpon the green.
11 475 The Cowslips tall, her pensioners bee,
11 476 In their gold coats, spots you see,
11 477 Those be Rubies, Fairie fauors,
11 478 In those freckles, liue their sauors,
11 479 I must go seeke some dew drops heere,
11 480 And hang a pearle in euery cowslips eare.
11 481 Farewell thou Lob of spirits, Ile be gon,
11 482 Our Queene and all her Elues come heere anon
11 483 
11 484    Rob. The King doth keepe his Reuels here to night,
11 485 Take heed the Queene come not within his sight,
11 486 For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,
11 487 Because that she, as her attendant, hath
11 488 A louely boy stolne from an Indian King,
11 489 She neuer had so sweet a changeling,
11 490 And iealous Oberon would haue the childe
11 491 Knight of his traine, to trace the Forrests wilde.
11 492 But she (perforce) with-holds the loued boy,
11 493 Crownes him with flowers, and makes him all her ioy.
11 494 And now they neuer meete in groue, or greene,
11 495 By fountaine cleere, or spangled star-light sheene,
11 496 But they do square, that all their Elues for feare
11 497 Creepe into Acorne cups and hide them there
11 498 
11 499    Fai. Either I mistake your shape and making quite,
11 500 Or else you are that shrew'd and knauish spirit
11 501 Cal'd Robin Good-fellow. Are you not hee,
11 502 That frights the maidens of the Villagree,
11 503 Skim milke, and sometimes labour in the querne,
11 504 And bootlesse make the breathlesse huswife cherne,
11 505 And sometime make the drinke to beare no barme,
11 506 Misleade night-wanderers, laughing at their harme,
11 507 Those that Hobgoblin call you, and sweet Pucke,
11 508 You do their worke, and they shall haue good lucke.
11 509 Are not you he?
11 510   Rob. Thou speak'st aright;
11 511 I am that merrie wanderer of the night:
11 512 I iest to Oberon, and make him smile,
11 513 When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,
11 514 Neighing in likenesse of a silly foale,
11 515 And sometime lurke I in a Gossips bole,
11 516 In very likenesse of a roasted crab:
11 517 And when she drinkes, against her lips I bob,
11 518 And on her withered dewlop poure the Ale.
11 519 The wisest Aunt telling the saddest tale,
11 520 Sometime for three-foot stoole, mistaketh me,
11 521 Then slip I from her bum, downe topples she,
11 522 And tailour cries, and fals into a coffe.
11 523 And then the whole quire hold their hips, and loffe,
11 524 And waxen in their mirth, and neeze, and sweare,
11 525 A merrier houre was neuer wasted there.
11 526 But roome Fairy, heere comes Oberon
11 527 
11 528    Fair. And heere my Mistris:
11 529 Would that he were gone.
11 530 Enter the King of Fairies at one doore with his traine, and the
11 531 Queene at
11 532 another with hers.
11 533 
11 534   Ob. Ill met by Moone-light.
11 535 Proud Tytania
11 536 
11 537    Qu. What, iealous Oberon? Fairy skip hence.
11 538 I haue forsworne his bed and companie
11 539 
11 540    Ob. Tarrie rash Wanton; am not I thy Lord?
11 541   Qu. Then I must be thy Lady: but I know
11 542 When thou wast stolne away from Fairy Land,
11 543 And in the shape of Corin, sate all day,
11 544 Playing on pipes of Corne, and versing loue
11 545 To amorous Phillida. Why art thou heere
11 546 Come from the farthest steepe of India?
11 547 But that forsooth the bouncing Amazon
11 548 Your buskin'd Mistresse, and your Warrior loue,
11 549 To Theseus must be Wedded; and you come,
11 550 To giue their bed ioy and prosperitie
11 551 
11 552    Ob. How canst thou thus for shame Tytania.
11 553 Glance at my credite, with Hippolita?
11 554 Knowing I know thy loue to Theseus?
11 555 Didst thou not leade him through the glimmering night
11 556 From Peregenia, whom he rauished?
11 557 And make him with faire Eagles breake his faith
11 558 With Ariadne, and Antiopa?
11 559   Que. These are the forgeries of iealousie,
11 560 And neuer since the middle Summers spring
11 561 Met we on hil, in dale, forrest, or mead,
11 562 By paued fountaine, or by rushie brooke,
11 563 Or in the beached margent of the sea,
11 564 To dance our ringlets to the whistling Winde,
11 565 But with thy braules thou hast disturb'd our sport.
11 566 Therefore the Windes, piping to vs in vaine,
11 567 As in reuenge, haue suck'd vp from the sea
11 568 Contagious fogges: Which falling in the Land,
11 569 Hath euerie petty Riuer made so proud,
11 570 That they haue ouer-borne their Continents.
11 571 The Oxe hath therefore stretch'd his yoake in vaine,
11 572 The Ploughman lost his sweat, and the greene Corne
11 573 Hath rotted, ere his youth attain'd a beard:
11 574 The fold stands empty in the drowned field,
11 575 And Crowes are fatted with the murrion flocke,
11 576 The nine mens Morris is fild vp with mud,
11 577 And the queint Mazes in the wanton greene,
11 578 For lacke of tread are vndistinguishable.
11 579 The humane mortals want their winter heere,
11 580 No night is now with hymne or caroll blest;
11 581 Therefore the Moone (the gouernesse of floods)
11 582 Pale in her anger, washes all the aire;
11 583 That Rheumaticke diseases doe abound.
11 584 And through this distemperature, we see
11 585 The seasons alter; hoared headed Frosts
11 586 Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson Rose,
11 587 And on old Hyems chinne and Icie crowne,
11 588 An odorous Chaplet of sweet Sommer buds
11 589 Is as in mockry set. The Spring, the Sommer,
11 590 The childing Autumne, angry Winter change
11 591 Their wonted Liueries, and the mazed world,
11 592 By their increase, now knowes not which is which;
11 593 And this same progeny of euills,
11 594 Comes from our debate, from our dissention,
11 595 We are their parents and originall
11 596 
11 597    Ober. Do you amend it then, it lies in you,
11 598 Why should Titania crosse her Oberon?
11 599 I do but beg a little changeling boy,
11 600 To be my Henchman
11 601 
11 602    Qu. Set your heart at rest,
11 603 The Fairy land buyes not the childe of me,
11 604 His mother was a Votresse of my Order,
11 605 And in the spiced Indian aire, by night
11 606 Full often hath she gossipt by my side,
11 607 And sat with me on Neptunes yellow sands,
11 608 Marking th' embarked traders on the flood,
11 609 When we haue laught to see the sailes conceiue,
11 610 And grow big bellied with the wanton winde:
11 611 Which she with pretty and with swimming gate,
11 612 Following (her wombe then rich with my yong squire)
11 613 Would imitate, and saile vpon the Land,
11 614 To fetch me trifles, and returne againe,
11 615 As from a voyage, rich with merchandize.
11 616 But she being mortall, of that boy did die,
11 617 And for her sake I doe reare vp her boy,
11 618 And for her sake I will not part with him
11 619 
11 620    Ob. How long within this wood intend you stay?
11 621   Qu. Perchance till after Theseus wedding day.
11 622 If you will patiently dance in our Round,
11 623 And see our Moone-light reuels, goe with vs;
11 624 If not, shun me and I will spare your haunts
11 625 
11 626    Ob. Giue me that boy, and I will goe with thee
11 627 
11 628    Qu. Not for thy Fairy Kingdome. Fairies away:
11 629 We shall chide downe right, if I longer stay.
11 630 
11 631 Exeunt
11 632 
11 633    Ob. Wel, go thy way: thou shalt not from this groue,
11 634 Till I torment thee for this iniury.
11 635 My gentle Pucke come hither; thou remembrest
11 636 Since once I sat vpon a promontory,
11 637 And heard a Meare-maide on a Dolphins backe,
11 638 Vttering such dulcet and harmonious breath,
11 639 That the rude sea grew ciuill at her song,
11 640 And certaine starres shot madly from their Spheares,
11 641 To heare the Sea-maids musicke
11 642 
11 643    Puc. I remember
11 644 
11 645    Ob. That very time I say (but thou couldst not)
11 646 Flying betweene the cold Moone and the earth,
11 647 Cupid all arm'd; a certaine aime he tooke
11 648 At a faire Vestall, throned by the West,
11 649 And loos'd his loue-shaft smartly from his bow,
11 650 As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts,
11 651 But I might see young Cupids fiery shaft
11 652 Quencht in the chaste beames of the watry Moone;
11 653 And the imperiall Votresse passed on,
11 654 In maiden meditation, fancy free.
11 655 Yet markt I where the bolt of Cupid fell.
11 656 It fell vpon a little westerne flower;
11 657 Before, milke-white: now purple with loues wound,
11 658 And maidens call it, Loue in idlenesse.
11 659 Fetch me that flower; the hearb I shew'd thee once,
11 660 The iuyce of it, on sleeping eye-lids laid,
11 661 Will make or man or woman madly dote
11 662 Vpon the next liue creature that it sees.
11 663 Fetch me this hearbe, and be thou heere againe,
11 664 Ere the Leuiathan can swim a league
11 665 
11 666    Pucke. Ile put a girdle about the earth, in forty minutes
11 667 
11 668    Ober. Hauing once this iuyce,
11 669 Ile watch Titania, when she is asleepe,
11 670 And drop the liquor of it in her eyes:
11 671 The next thing when she waking lookes vpon,
11 672 (Be it on Lyon, Beare, or Wolfe, or Bull,
11 673 On medling Monkey, or on busie Ape)
11 674 Shee shall pursue it, with the soule of loue.
11 675 And ere I take this charme off from her sight,
11 676 (As I can take it with another hearbe)
11 677 Ile make her render vp her Page to me.
11 678 But who comes heere? I am inuisible,
11 679 And I will ouer-heare their conference.
11 680 Enter Demetrius, Helena following him.
11 681 
11 682   Deme. I loue thee not, therefore pursue me not,
11 683 Where is Lysander, and faire Hermia?
11 684 The one Ile stay, the other stayeth me.
11 685 Thou toldst me they were stolne into this wood;
11 686 And heere am I, and wood within this wood,
11 687 Because I cannot meet my Hermia.
11 688 Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more
11 689 
11 690    Hel. You draw me, you hard-hearted Adamant,
11 691 But yet you draw not Iron, for my heart
11 692 Is true as steele. Leaue you your power to draw,
11 693 And I shall haue no power to follow you
11 694 
11 695    Deme. Do I entice you? do I speake you faire?
11 696 Or rather doe I not in plainest truth,
11 697 Tell you I doe not, nor I cannot loue you?
11 698   Hel. And euen for that doe I loue thee the more;
11 699 I am your spaniell, and Demetrius,
11 700 The more you beat me, I will fawne on you.
11 701 Vse me but as your spaniell; spurne me, strike me,
11 702 Neglect me, lose me; onely giue me leaue
11 703 (Vnworthy as I am) to follow you.
11 704 What worser place can I beg in your loue,
11 705 (And yet a place of high respect with me)
11 706 Then to be vsed as you doe your dogge
11 707 
11 708    Dem. Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit,
11 709 For I am sicke when I do looke on thee
11 710 
11 711    Hel. And I am sicke when I looke not on you
11 712 
11 713    Dem. You doe impeach your modesty too much,
11 714 To leaue the Citty, and commit your selfe
11 715 Into the hands of one that loues you not,
11 716 To trust the opportunity of night.
11 717 And the ill counsell of a desert place,
11 718 With the rich worth of your virginity
11 719 
11 720    Hel. Your vertue is my priuiledge: for that
11 721 It is not night when I doe see your face.
11 722 Therefore I thinke I am not in the night,
11 723 Nor doth this wood lacke worlds of company,
11 724 For you in my respect are all the world.
11 725 Then how can it be said I am alone,
11 726 When all the world is heere to looke on me?
11 727   Dem. Ile run from thee, and hide me in the brakes,
11 728 And leaue thee to the mercy of wilde beasts
11 729 
11 730    Hel. The wildest hath not such a heart as you;
11 731 Runne when you will, the story shall be chang'd:
11 732 Apollo flies and Daphne holds the chase;
11 733 The Doue pursues the Griffin, the milde Hinde
11 734 Makes speed to catch the Tyger. Bootlesse speede,
11 735 When cowardise pursues, and valour flies
11 736 
11 737    Demet. I will not stay thy questions, let me go;
11 738 Or if thou follow me, doe not beleeue,
11 739 But I shall doe thee mischiefe in the wood
11 740 
11 741    Hel. I, in the Temple, in the Towne, and Field
11 742 You doe me mischiefe. Fye Demetrius,
11 743 Your wrongs doe set a scandall on my sexe:
11 744 We cannot fight for loue, as men may doe;
11 745 We should be woo'd, and were not made to wooe.
11 746 I follow thee, and make a heauen of hell,
11 747 To die vpon the hand I loue so well.
11 748 Enter.
11 749 
11 750   Ob. Fare thee well Nymph, ere he do leaue this groue,
11 751 Thou shalt flie him, and he shall seeke thy loue.
11 752 Hast thou the flower there? Welcome wanderer.
11 753 Enter Pucke.
11 754 
11 755   Puck. I there it is
11 756 
11 757    Ob. I pray thee giue it me.
11 758 I know a banke where the wilde time blowes,
11 759 Where Oxslips and the nodding Violet growes,
11 760 Quite ouer-cannoped with luscious woodbine,
11 761 With sweet muske roses, and with Eglantine;
11 762 There sleepes Tytania, sometime of the night,
11 763 Lul'd in these flowers, with dances and delight:
11 764 And there the snake throwes her enammel'd skinne,
11 765 Weed wide enough to rap a Fairy in.
11 766 And with the iuyce of this Ile streake her eyes,
11 767 And make her full of hatefull fantasies.
11 768 Take thou some of it, and seek through this groue;
11 769 A sweet Athenian Lady is in loue
11 770 With a disdainefull youth: annoint his eyes,
11 771 But doe it when the next thing he espies,
11 772 May be the Lady. Thou shalt know the man,
11 773 By the Athenian garments he hath on.
11 774 Effect it with some care, that he may proue
11 775 More fond on her, then she vpon her loue;
11 776 And looke thou meet me ere the first Cocke crow
11 777 
11 778    Pu. Feare not my Lord, your seruant shall do so.
11 779 Enter.
11 780 
11 781 Enter Queene of Fairies, with her traine.
11 782 
11 783   Queen. Come, now a Roundell, and a Fairy song;
11 784 Then for the third part of a minute hence,
11 785 Some to kill Cankers in the muske rose buds,
11 786 Some warre with Reremise, for their leathern wings.
11 787 To make my small Elues coates, and some keepe backe
11 788 The clamorous Owle that nightly hoots and wonders
11 789 At our queint spirits: Sing me now asleepe,
11 790 Then to your offices, and let me rest
11 791 
11 792    Fairies Sing. You spotted Snakes with double tongue,
11 793 Thorny Hedgehogges be not seene,
11 794 Newts and blinde wormes do no wrong,
11 795 Come not neere our Fairy Queene.
11 796 Philomele with melodie,
11 797 Sing in your sweet Lullaby.
11 798 Lulla, lulla, lullaby, lulla, lulla, lullaby,
11 799 Neuer harme, nor spell, nor charme,
11 800 Come our louely Lady nye,
11 801 So good night with Lullaby
11 802 
11 803    2.Fairy. Weauing Spiders come not heere,
11 804 Hence you long leg'd Spinners, hence:
11 805 Beetles blacke approach not neere;
11 806 Worme nor Snayle doe no offence.
11 807 Philomele with melody, &c
11 808 
11 809    1.Fairy. Hence away, now all is well;
11 810 One aloofe, stand Centinell.
11 811 
11 812 Shee sleepes.
11 813 
11 814 Enter Oberon.
11 815 
11 816   Ober. What thou seest when thou dost wake,
11 817 Do it for thy true Loue take:
11 818 Loue and languish for his sake.
11 819 Be it Ounce, or Catte, or Beare,
11 820 Pard, or Boare with bristled haire,
11 821 In thy eye that shall appeare,
11 822 When thou wak'st, it is thy deare,
11 823 Wake when some vile thing is neere.
11 824 Enter Lisander and Hermia.
11 825 
11 826   Lis. Faire loue, you faint with wandring in y woods,
11 827 And to speake troth I haue forgot our way:
11 828 Wee'll rest vs Hermia, If you thinke it good,
11 829 And tarry for the comfort of the day
11 830 
11 831    Her. Be it so Lysander; finde you out a bed,
11 832 For I vpon this banke will rest my head
11 833 
11 834    Lys. One turfe shall serue as pillow for vs both,
11 835 One heart, one bed, two bosomes, and one troth
11 836 
11 837    Her. Nay good Lysander, for my sake my deere
11 838 Lie further off yet, doe not lie so neere
11 839 
11 840    Lys. O take the sence sweet, of my innocence,
11 841 Loue takes the meaning, in loues conference,
11 842 I meane that my heart vnto yours is knit,
11 843 So that but one heart can you make of it.
11 844 Two bosomes interchanged with an oath,
11 845 So then two bosomes, and a single troth.
11 846 Then by your side, no bed-roome me deny,
11 847 For lying so, Hermia, I doe not lye
11 848 
11 849    Her. Lysander riddles very prettily;
11 850 Now much beshrew my manners and my pride,
11 851 If Hermia meant to say, Lysander lied.
11 852 But gentle friend, for loue and courtesie
11 853 Lie further off, in humane modesty,
11 854 Such separation, as may well be said,
11 855 Becomes a vertuous batchelour, and a maide,
11 856 So farre be distant, and good night sweet friend;
11 857 Thy loue nere alter, till thy sweet life end
11 858 
11 859    Lys. Amen, amen, to that faire prayer, say I,
11 860 And then end life, when I end loyalty:
11 861 Heere is my bed, sleepe giue thee all his rest
11 862 
11 863    Her. With halfe that wish, the wishers eyes be prest.
11 864 Enter Pucke. They sleepe.
11 865 
11 866   Puck. Through the Forest haue I gone,
11 867 But Athenian finde I none,
11 868 One whose eyes I might approue
11 869 This flowers force in stirring loue.
11 870 Nigh and silence: who is heere?
11 871 Weedes of Athens he doth weare:
11 872 This is he (my master said)
11 873 Despised the Athenian maide:
11 874 And heere the maiden sleeping sound,
11 875 On the danke and durty ground.
11 876 Pretty soule, she durst not lye
11 877 Neere this lacke-loue, this kill-curtesie.
11 878 Churle, vpon thy eyes I throw
11 879 All the power this charme doth owe:
11 880 When thou wak'st, let loue forbid
11 881 Sleepe his seate on thy eye-lid.
11 882 So awake when I am gone:
11 883 For I must now to Oberon.
11 884 Enter.
11 885 
11 886 Enter Demetrius and Helena running.
11 887 
11 888   Hel. Stay, though thou kill me, sweete Demetrius
11 889 
11 890    De. I charge thee hence, and do not haunt me thus
11 891 
11 892    Hel. O wilt thou darkling leaue me? do not so
11 893 
11 894    De. Stay on thy perill, I alone will goe.
11 895 
11 896 Exit Demetrius.
11 897 
11 898   Hel. O I am out of breath, in this fond chace,
11 899 The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace,
11 900 Happy is Hermia, wheresoere she lies;
11 901 For she hath blessed and attractiue eyes.
11 902 How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt teares.
11 903 If so, my eyes are oftner washt then hers.
11 904 No, no, I am as vgly as a Beare;
11 905 For beasts that meete me, runne away for feare,
11 906 Therefore no maruaile, though Demetrius
11 907 Doe as a monster, flie my presence thus.
11 908 What wicked and dissembling glasse of mine,
11 909 Made me compare with Hermias sphery eyne?
11 910 But who is here? Lysander on the ground;
11 911 Deade or asleepe? I see no bloud, no wound,
11 912 Lysander, if you liue, good sir awake
11 913 
11 914    Lys. And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake.
11 915 Transparent Helena, nature her shewes art,
11 916 That through thy bosome makes me see thy heart.
11 917 Where is Demetrius? oh how fit a word
11 918 Is that vile name, to perish on my sword!
11 919   Hel. Do not say so Lysander, say not so:
11 920 What though he loue your Hermia? Lord, what though?
11 921 Yet Hermia still loues you; then be content
11 922 
11 923    Lys. Content with Hermia? no, I do repent
11 924 The tedious minutes I with her haue spent.
11 925 Not Hermia, but Helena now I loue;
11 926 Who will not change a Rauen for a Doue?
11 927 The will of man is by his reason sway'd:
11 928 And reason saies you are the worthier Maide.
11 929 Things growing are not ripe vntill their season;
11 930 So I being yong, till now ripe not to reason,
11 931 And touching now the point of humane skill,
11 932 Reason becomes the Marshall to my will.
11 933 And leades me to your eyes, where I orelooke
11 934 Loues stories, written in Loues richest booke
11 935 
11 936    Hel. Wherefore was I to this keene mockery borne?
11 937 When at your hands did I deserue this scorne?
11 938 Ist not enough, ist not enough, yong man,
11 939 That I did neuer, no nor neuer can,
11 940 Deserue a sweete looke from Demetrius eye,
11 941 But you must flout my insufficiency?
11 942 Good troth you do me wrong (good-sooth you do)
11 943 In such disdainfull manner, me to wooe.
11 944 But fare you well; perforce I must confesse,
11 945 I thought you Lord of more true gentlenesse.
11 946 Oh, that a Lady of one man refus'd,
11 947 Should of another therefore be abus'd.
11 948 Enter
11 949 
11 950    Lys. She sees not Hermia: Hermia sleepe thou there,
11 951 And neuer maist thou come Lysander neere;
11 952 For as a surfeit of the sweetest things
11 953 The deepest loathing to the stomacke brings:
11 954 Or as the heresies that men do leaue,
11 955 Are hated most of those that did deceiue:
11 956 So thou, my surfeit, and my heresie,
11 957 Of all be hated; but the most of me;
11 958 And all my powers addresse your loue and might,
11 959 To honour Helen, and to be her Knight.
11 960 Enter.
11 961 
11 962   Her. Helpe me Lysander, helpe me; do thy best
11 963 To plucke this crawling serpent from my brest.
11 964 Aye me, for pitty; what a dreame was here?
11 965 Lysander looke, how I do quake with feare:
11 966 Me-thought a serpent eate my heart away,
11 967 And yet sat smiling at his cruell prey.
11 968 Lysander, What remoou'd? Lysander, Lord,
11 969 What, out of hearing, gone? No sound, no word?
11 970 Alacke where are you? speake and if you heare:
11 971 Speake of all loues; I sound almost with feare.
11 972 No, then I well perceiue you are not nye,
11 973 Either death or you Ile finde immediately.
11 974 Enter.
11 975 
11 976 
11 977 Actus Tertius.
11 978 
11 979 Enter the Clownes.
11 980 
11 981   Bot. Are we all met?
11 982   Quin. Pat, pat, and here's a maruailous conuenient
11 983 place for our rehearsall. This greene plot shall be our
11 984 stage, this hauthorne brake our tyring house, and we will
11 985 do it in action, as we will do it before the Duke
11 986 
11 987    Bot. Peter Quince?
11 988   Peter. What saist thou, bully Bottome?
11 989   Bot. There are things in this Comedy of Piramus and
11 990 Thisby, that will neuer please. First, Piramus must draw a
11 991 sword to kill himselfe; which the Ladies cannot abide.
11 992 How answere you that?
11 993   Snout. Berlaken, a parlous feare
11 994 
11 995    Star. I beleeue we must leaue the killing out, when
11 996 all is done
11 997 
11 998    Bot. Not a whit, I haue a deuice to make all well.
11 999 Write me a Prologue, and let the Prologue seeme to say,
11 1000 we will do no harme with our swords, and that Pyramus
11 1001 is not kill'd indeede: and for the more better assurance,
11 1002 tell them, that I Piramus am not Piramus, but Bottome the
11 1003 Weauer; this will put them out of feare
11 1004 
11 1005    Quin. Well, we will haue such a Prologue, and it shall
11 1006 be written in eight and sixe
11 1007 
11 1008    Bot. No, make it two more, let it be written in eight
11 1009 and eight
11 1010 
11 1011    Snout. Will not the Ladies be afear'd of the Lyon?
11 1012   Star. I feare it, I promise you
11 1013 
11 1014    Bot. Masters, you ought to consider with your selues, to
11 1015 bring in (God shield vs) a Lyon among Ladies, is a most
11 1016 dreadfull thing. For there is not a more fearefull wilde
11 1017 foule then your Lyon liuing: and wee ought to looke
11 1018 to it
11 1019 
11 1020    Snout. Therefore another Prologue must tell he is not
11 1021 a Lyon
11 1022 
11 1023    Bot. Nay, you must name his name, and halfe his face
11 1024 must be seene through the Lyons necke, and he himselfe
11 1025 must speake through, saying thus, or to the same defect;
11 1026 Ladies, or faire Ladies, I would wish you, or I would
11 1027 request you, or I would entreat you, not to feare, not to
11 1028 tremble: my life for yours. If you thinke I come hither
11 1029 as a Lyon, it were pitty of my life. No, I am no such
11 1030 thing, I am a man as other men are; and there indeed let
11 1031 him name his name, and tell him plainly hee is Snug the
11 1032 ioyner
11 1033 
11 1034    Quin. Well, it shall be so; but there is two hard
11 1035 things, that is, to bring the Moone-light into a chamber:
11 1036 for you know Piramus and Thisby meete by Moonelight
11 1037 
11 1038    Sn. Doth the Moone shine that night wee play our
11 1039 play?
11 1040   Bot. A Calender, a Calender, looke in the Almanack,
11 1041 finde out Moone-shine, finde out Moone-shine.
11 1042 Enter Pucke.
11 1043 
11 1044   Quin. Yes, it doth shine that night
11 1045 
11 1046    Bot. Why then may you leaue a casement of the great
11 1047 chamber window (where we play) open, and the Moone
11 1048 may shine in at the casement
11 1049 
11 1050    Quin. I, or else one must come in with a bush of thorns
11 1051 and a lanthorne, and say he comes to disfigure, or to present
11 1052 the person of Moone-shine. Then there is another
11 1053 thing, we must haue a wall in the great Chamber; for Piramus
11 1054 and Thisby (saies the story) did talke through the
11 1055 chinke of a wall
11 1056 
11 1057    Sn. You can neuer bring in a wall. What say you
11 1058 Bottome?
11 1059   Bot. Some man or other must present wall, and let
11 1060 him haue some Plaster, or some Lome, or some rough
11 1061 cast about him, to signifie wall; or let him hold his fingers
11 1062 thus; and through that cranny shall Piramus and
11 1063 Thisby whisper
11 1064 
11 1065    Quin. If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit
11 1066 downe euery mothers sonne, and rehearse your parts.
11 1067 Piramus, you begin; when you haue spoken your speech,
11 1068 enter into that Brake, and so euery one according to his
11 1069 cue.
11 1070 Enter Robin.
11 1071 
11 1072   Rob. What hempen home-spuns haue we swaggering
11 1073 here,
11 1074 So neere the Cradle of the Faierie Queene?
11 1075 What, a Play toward? Ile be an auditor,
11 1076 An Actor too perhaps, if I see cause
11 1077 
11 1078    Quin. Speake Piramus: Thisby stand forth
11 1079 
11 1080    Pir. Thisby, the flowers of odious sauors sweete
11 1081 
11 1082    Quin. Odours, odours
11 1083 
11 1084    Pir. Odours sauors sweete,
11 1085 So hath thy breath, my dearest Thisby deare.
11 1086 But harke, a voyce: stay thou but here a while,
11 1087 And by and by I will to thee appeare.
11 1088 
11 1089 Exit. Pir.
11 1090 
11 1091   Puck. A stranger Piramus, then ere plaid here
11 1092 
11 1093    This. Must I speake now?
11 1094   Pet. I marry must you. For you must vnderstand he
11 1095 goes but to see a noyse that he heard, and is to come againe
11 1096 
11 1097    Thys. Most radiant Piramus, most Lilly white of hue,
11 1098 Of colour like the red rose on triumphant bryer,
11 1099 Most brisky Iuuenall, and eke most louely Iew,
11 1100 As true as truest horse, that yet would neuer tyre,
11 1101 Ile meete thee Piramus, at Ninnies toombe
11 1102 
11 1103    Pet. Ninus toombe man: why, you must not speake
11 1104 that yet; that you answere to Piramus: you speake all
11 1105 your part at once, cues and all. Piramus enter, your cue is
11 1106 past; it is neuer tyre
11 1107 
11 1108    Thys. O, as true as truest horse, that yet would neuer
11 1109 tyre:
11 1110   Pir. If I were faire, Thisby I were onely thine
11 1111 
11 1112    Pet. O monstrous. O strange. We are hanted; pray
11 1113 masters, flye masters, helpe.
11 1114 
11 1115 The Clownes all Exit.
11 1116 
11 1117   Puk. Ile follow you, Ile leade you about a Round,
11 1118 Through bogge, through bush, through brake, through bryer,
11 1119 Sometime a horse Ile be, sometime a hound:
11 1120 A hogge, a headlesse beare, sometime a fire,
11 1121 And neigh, and barke, and grunt, and rore, and burne,
11 1122 Like horse, hound, hog, beare, fire, at euery turne.
11 1123 Enter.
11 1124 
11 1125 Enter Piramus with the Asse head.
11 1126 
11 1127   Bot. Why do they run away? This is a knauery of
11 1128 them to make me afeard.
11 1129 Enter Snowt
11 1130 
11 1131    Sn. O Bottom, thou art chang'd; What doe I see on
11 1132 thee?
11 1133   Bot. What do you see? You see an Asse-head of your
11 1134 owne, do you?
11 1135 Enter Peter Quince.
11 1136 
11 1137   Pet. Blesse thee Bottome, blesse thee; thou art translated.
11 1138 Enter.
11 1139 
11 1140   Bot. I see their knauery; this is to make an asse of me,
11 1141 to fright me if they could; but I will not stirre from
11 1142 this place, do what they can. I will walke vp and downe
11 1143 here, and I will sing that they shall heare I am not afraid.
11 1144 The Woosell cocke, so blacke of hew,
11 1145 With Orenge-tawny bill.
11 1146 The Throstle, with his note so true,
11 1147 The Wren and little quill
11 1148 
11 1149    Tyta. What Angell wakes me from my flowry bed?
11 1150   Bot. The Finch, the Sparrow, and the Larke,
11 1151 The plainsong Cuckow gray;
11 1152 Whose note full many a man doth marke,
11 1153 And dares not answere, nay.
11 1154 For indeede, who would set his wit to so foolish a bird?
11 1155 Who would giue a bird the lye, though he cry Cuckow,
11 1156 neuer so?
11 1157   Tyta. I pray thee gentle mortall, sing againe,
11 1158 Mine eare is much enamored of thy note;
11 1159 On the first view to say, to sweare I loue thee.
11 1160 So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape.
11 1161 And thy faire vertues force (perforce) doth moue me
11 1162 
11 1163    Bot. Me-thinkes mistresse, you should haue little
11 1164 reason for that: and yet to say the truth, reason and
11 1165 loue keepe little company together, nowadayes.
11 1166 The more the pittie, that some honest neighbours will
11 1167 not make them friends. Nay, I can gleeke vpon occasion
11 1168 
11 1169    Tyta. Thou art as wise, as thou art beautifull
11 1170 
11 1171    Bot. Not so neither: but if I had wit enough to get
11 1172 out of this wood, I haue enough to serue mine owne
11 1173 turne
11 1174 
11 1175    Tyta. Out of this wood, do not desire to goe,
11 1176 Thou shalt remaine here, whether thou wilt or no.
11 1177 I am a spirit of no common rate:
11 1178 The Summer still doth tend vpon my state,
11 1179 And I doe loue thee; therefore goe with me,
11 1180 Ile giue thee Fairies to attend on thee;
11 1181 And they shall fetch thee Iewels from the deepe,
11 1182 And sing, while thou on pressed flowers dost sleepe:
11 1183 And I will purge thy mortall grossenesse so,
11 1184 That thou shalt like an airie spirit go.
11 1185 Enter Pease-blossome, Cobweb, Moth, Mustardseede, and foure
11 1186 Fairies.
11 1187 
11 1188   Fai. Ready; and I, and I, and I, Where shall we go?
11 1189   Tita. Be kinde and curteous to this Gentleman,
11 1190 Hop in his walkes, and gambole in his eies,
11 1191 Feede him with Apricocks, and Dewberries,
11 1192 With purple Grapes, greene Figs, and Mulberries,
11 1193 The honie-bags steale from the humble Bees,
11 1194 And for night-tapers crop their waxen thighes,
11 1195 And light them at the fierie-Glow-wormes eyes,
11 1196 To haue my loue to bed, and to arise:
11 1197 And plucke the wings from painted Butterflies,
11 1198 To fan the Moone-beames from his sleeping eies.
11 1199 Nod to him Elues, and doe him curtesies
11 1200 
11 1201    1.Fai. Haile mortall, haile
11 1202 
11 1203    2.Fai. Haile
11 1204 
11 1205    3.Fai. Haile
11 1206 
11 1207    Bot. I cry your worships mercy hartily; I beseech
11 1208 your worships name
11 1209 
11 1210    Cob. Cobweb
11 1211 
11 1212    Bot. I shall desire you of more acquaintance, good
11 1213 Master Cobweb: if I cut my finger, I shall make bold
11 1214 with you.
11 1215 Your name honest Gentleman?
11 1216   Pease. Pease Blossome
11 1217 
11 1218    Bot. I pray you commend me to mistresse Squash,
11 1219 your mother, and to master Peascod your father. Good
11 1220 master Pease-blossome, I shal desire of you more acquaintance
11 1221 to. Your name I beseech you sir?
11 1222   Mus. Mustard-seede
11 1223 
11 1224    Peas. Pease-blossome
11 1225 
11 1226    Bot. Good master Mustard seede, I know your patience
11 1227 well: that same cowardly gyant-like Oxe beefe
11 1228 hath deuoured many a gentleman of your house. I promise
11 1229 you, your kindred hath made my eyes water ere
11 1230 now. I desire you more acquaintance, good Master
11 1231 Mustard-seede
11 1232 
11 1233    Tita. Come waite vpon him, lead him to my bower.
11 1234 The Moone me-thinks, lookes with a watrie eie,
11 1235 And when she weepes, weepe euerie little flower,
11 1236 Lamenting some enforced chastitie.
11 1237 Tye vp my louers tongue, bring him silently.
11 1238 Enter.
11 1239 
11 1240 Enter King of Pharies, solus.
11 1241 
11 1242   Ob. I wonder if Titania be awak't;
11 1243 Then what it was that next came in her eye,
11 1244 Which she must dote on, in extremitie.
11 1245 Enter Pucke.
11 1246 
11 1247 Here comes my messenger: how now mad spirit,
11 1248 What night-rule now about this haunted groue?
11 1249   Puck. My Mistris with a monster is in loue,
11 1250 Neere to her close and consecrated bower,
11 1251 While she was in her dull and sleeping hower,
11 1252 A crew of patches, rude Mechanicals,
11 1253 That worke for bread vpon Athenian stals,
11 1254 Were met together to rehearse a Play,
11 1255 Intended for great Theseus nuptiall day:
11 1256 The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort,
11 1257 Who Piramus presented, in their sport,
11 1258 Forsooke his Scene, and entred in a brake,
11 1259 When I did him at this aduantage take,
11 1260 An Asses nole I fixed on his head.
11 1261 Anon his Thisbie must be answered,
11 1262 And forth my Mimmick comes: when they him spie,
11 1263 As Wilde-geese, that the creeping Fowler eye,
11 1264 Or russed-pated choughes, many in sort
11 1265 (Rising and cawing at the guns report)
11 1266 Seuer themselues, and madly sweepe the skye:
11 1267 So at his sight, away his fellowes flye,
11 1268 And at our stampe, here ore and ore one fals;
11 1269 He murther cries, and helpe from Athens cals.
11 1270 Their sense thus weake, lost with their feares thus strong,
11 1271 Made senslesse things begin to do them wrong.
11 1272 For briars and thornes at their apparell snatch,
11 1273 Some sleeues, some hats, from yeelders all things catch,
11 1274 I led them on in this distracted feare,
11 1275 And left sweete Piramus translated there:
11 1276 When in that moment (so it came to passe)
11 1277 Tytania waked, and straightway lou'd an Asse
11 1278 
11 1279    Ob. This fals out better then I could deuise:
11 1280 But hast thou yet lacht the Athenians eyes,
11 1281 With the loue iuyce, as I bid thee doe?
11 1282   Rob. I tooke him sleeping (that is finisht to)
11 1283 And the Athenian woman by his side,
11 1284 That when he wak't, of force she must be eyde.
11 1285 Enter Demetrius and Hermia.
11 1286 
11 1287   Ob. Stand close, this is the same Athenian
11 1288 
11 1289    Rob. This is the woman, but not this the man
11 1290 
11 1291    Dem. O why rebuke you him that loues you so?
11 1292 Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe
11 1293 
11 1294    Her. Now I but chide, but I should vse thee worse.
11 1295 For thou (I feare) hast giuen me cause to curse,
11 1296 If thou hast slaine Lysander in his sleepe,
11 1297 Being oreshooes in bloud, plunge in the deepe, and kill
11 1298 me too:
11 1299 The Sunne was not so true vnto the day,
11 1300 As he to me. Would he haue stollen away,
11 1301 From sleeping Hermia? Ile beleeue as soone
11 1302 This whole earth may be bord, and that the Moone
11 1303 May through the Center creepe, and so displease
11 1304 Her brothers noonetide, with th'Antipodes.
11 1305 It cannot be but thou hast murdred him,
11 1306 So should a murtherer looke, so dead, so grim
11 1307 
11 1308    Dem. So should the murderer looke, and so should I,
11 1309 Pierst through the heart with your stearne cruelty:
11 1310 Yet you the murderer lookes as bright as cleare,
11 1311 As yonder Venus in her glimmering spheare
11 1312 
11 1313    Her. What's this to my Lysander? where is he?
11 1314 Ah good Demetrius, wilt thou giue him me?
11 1315   Dem. I'de rather giue his carkasse to my hounds
11 1316 
11 1317    Her. Out dog, out cur, thou driu'st me past the bounds
11 1318 Of maidens patience. Hast thou slaine him then?
11 1319 Henceforth be neuer numbred among men.
11 1320 Oh, once tell true, euen for my sake,
11 1321 Durst thou a lookt vpon him, being awake?
11 1322 And hast thou kill'd him sleeping? O braue tutch:
11 1323 Could not a worme, an Adder do so much?
11 1324 An Adder did it: for with doubler tongue
11 1325 Then thine (thou serpent) neuer Adder stung
11 1326 
11 1327    Dem. You spend your passion on a mispris'd mood,
11 1328 I am not guiltie of Lysanders blood:
11 1329 Nor is he dead for ought that I can tell
11 1330 
11 1331    Her. I pray thee tell me then that he is well
11 1332 
11 1333    Dem. And if I could, what should I get therefore?
11 1334   Her. A priuiledge, neuer to see me more;
11 1335 And from thy hated presence part I: see me no more
11 1336 Whether he be dead or no.
11 1337 Enter.
11 1338 
11 1339   Dem. There is no following her in this fierce vaine,
11 1340 Here therefore for a while I will remaine.
11 1341 So sorrowes heauinesse doth heauier grow:
11 1342 For debt that bankrout slip doth sorrow owe,
11 1343 Which now in some slight measure it will pay,
11 1344 If for his tender here I make some stay.
11 1345 
11 1346 Lie downe.
11 1347 
11 1348   Ob. What hast thou done? Thou hast mistaken quite
11 1349 And laid the loue iuyce on some true loues sight:
11 1350 Of thy misprision, must perforce ensue
11 1351 Some true loue turn'd, and not a false turn'd true
11 1352 
11 1353    Rob. Then fate ore-rules, that one man holding troth,
11 1354 A million faile, confounding oath on oath
11 1355 
11 1356    Ob. About the wood, goe swifter then the winde,
11 1357 And Helena of Athens looke thou finde.
11 1358 All fancy sicke she is, and pale of cheere,
11 1359 With sighes of loue, that costs the fresh bloud deare.
11 1360 By some illusion see thou bring her heere,
11 1361 Ile charme his eyes against she doth appeare
11 1362 
11 1363    Robin. I go, I go, looke how I goe,
11 1364 Swifter then arrow from the Tartars bowe.
11 1365 Enter.
11 1366 
11 1367   Ob. Flower of this purple die,
11 1368 Hit with Cupids archery,
11 1369 Sinke in apple of his eye,
11 1370 When his loue he doth espie,
11 1371 Let her shine as gloriously
11 1372 As the Venus of the sky.
11 1373 When thou wak'st if she be by,
11 1374 Beg of her for remedy.
11 1375 Enter Pucke.
11 1376 
11 1377   Puck. Captaine of our Fairy band,
11 1378 Helena is heere at hand,
11 1379 And the youth, mistooke by me,
11 1380 Pleading for a Louers fee.
11 1381 Shall we their fond Pageant see?
11 1382 Lord, what fooles these mortals be!
11 1383   Ob. Stand aside: the noyse they make,
11 1384 Will cause Demetrius to awake
11 1385 
11 1386    Puck. Then will two at once wooe one,
11 1387 That must needs be sport alone:
11 1388 And those things doe best please me,
11 1389 That befall preposterously.
11 1390 Enter Lysander and Helena.
11 1391 
11 1392   Lys. Why should you think y I should wooe in scorn?
11 1393 Scorne and derision neuer comes in teares:
11 1394 Looke when I vow I weepe; and vowes so borne,
11 1395 In their natiuity all truth appeares.
11 1396 How can these things in me, seeme scorne to you?
11 1397 Bearing the badge of faith to proue them true
11 1398 
11 1399    Hel. You doe aduance your cunning more & more,
11 1400 When truth kils truth, O diuelish holy fray!
11 1401 These vowes are Hermias. Will you giue her ore?
11 1402 Weigh oath with oath, and you will nothing weigh.
11 1403 Your vowes to her, and me, (put in two scales)
11 1404 Will euen weigh, and both as light as tales
11 1405 
11 1406    Lys. I had no iudgement, when to her I swore
11 1407 
11 1408    Hel. Nor none in my minde, now you giue her ore
11 1409 
11 1410    Lys. Demetrius loues her, and he loues not you.
11 1411 
11 1412 Awa.
11 1413 
11 1414   Dem. O Helen, goddesse, nimph, perfect, diuine,
11 1415 To what, my loue, shall I compare thine eyne!
11 1416 Christall is muddy, O how ripe in show,
11 1417 Thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow!
11 1418 That pure congealed white, high Taurus snow,
11 1419 Fan'd with the Easterne winde, turnes to a crow,
11 1420 When thou holdst vp thy hand. O let me kisse
11 1421 This Princesse of pure white, this seale of blisse
11 1422 
11 1423    Hell. O spight! O hell! I see you are all bent
11 1424 To set against me, for your merriment:
11 1425 If you were ciuill, and knew curtesie,
11 1426 You would not doe me thus much iniury.
11 1427 Can you not hate me, as I know you doe,
11 1428 But you must ioyne in soules to mocke me to?
11 1429 If you are men, as men you are in show,
11 1430 You would not vse a gentle Lady so;
11 1431 To vow, and sweare, and superpraise my parts,
11 1432 When I am sure you hate me with your hearts.
11 1433 You both are Riuals, and loue Hermia;
11 1434 And now both Riuals to mocke Helena.
11 1435 A trim exploit, a manly enterprize,
11 1436 To coniure teares vp in a poore maids eyes,
11 1437 With your derision; none of noble sort,
11 1438 Would so offend a Virgin, and extort
11 1439 A poore soules patience, all to make you sport,
11 1440   Lysa. You are vnkind Demetrius; be not so,
11 1441 For you loue Hermia; this you know I know;
11 1442 And here with all good will, with all my heart,
11 1443 In Hermias loue I yeeld you vp my part;
11 1444 And yours of Helena, To me bequeath,
11 1445 Whom I do loue, and will do to my death
11 1446 
11 1447    Hel. Neuer did mockers wast more idle breth
11 1448 
11 1449    Dem. Lysander, keep thy Hermia, I will none:
11 1450 If ere I lou'd her, all that loue is gone.
11 1451 My heart to her, but as guest-wise soiourn'd,
11 1452 And now to Helen it is home return'd,
11 1453 There to remaine
11 1454 
11 1455    Lys. It is not so
11 1456 
11 1457    De. Disparage not the faith thou dost not know,
11 1458 Lest to thy perill thou abide it deare.
11 1459 Looke where thy Loue comes, yonder is thy deare.
11 1460 Enter Hermia.
11 1461 
11 1462   Her. Dark night, that from the eye his function takes,
11 1463 The eare more quicke of apprehension makes,
11 1464 Wherein it doth impaire the seeing sense,
11 1465 It paies the hearing double recompence.
11 1466 Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander found,
11 1467 Mine eare (I thanke it) brought me to that sound.
11 1468 But why vnkindly didst thou leaue me so?
11 1469   Lysan. Why should hee stay whom Loue doth presse to go?
11 1470   Her. What loue could presse Lysander from my side?
11 1471   Lys. Lysanders loue (that would not let him bide)
11 1472 Faire Helena; who more engilds the night,
11 1473 Then all yon fierie oes, and eies of light.
11 1474 Why seek'st thou me? Could not this make thee know,
11 1475 The hate I bare thee, made me leaue thee so?
11 1476   Her. You speake not as you thinke; it cannot be
11 1477 
11 1478    Hel. Loe, she is one of this confederacy,
11 1479 Now I perceiue they haue conioyn'd all three,
11 1480 To fashion this false sport in spight of me.
11 1481 Iniurous Hermia, most vngratefull maid,
11 1482 Haue you conspir'd, haue you with these contriu'd
11 1483 To baite me, with this foule derision?
11 1484 Is all the counsell that we two haue shar'd,
11 1485 The sisters vowes, the houres that we haue spent,
11 1486 When wee haue chid the hasty footed time,
11 1487 For parting vs; O, is all forgot?
11 1488 All schooledaies friendship, child-hood innocence?
11 1489 We Hermia, like two Artificiall gods,
11 1490 Haue with our needles, created both one flower,
11 1491 Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,
11 1492 Both warbling of one song, both in one key:
11 1493 As if our hands, our sides, voices, and mindes
11 1494 Had beene incorporate. So we grew together,
11 1495 Like to a double cherry, seeming parted,
11 1496 But yet a vnion in partition,
11 1497 Two louely berries molded on one stem,
11 1498 So with two seeming bodies, but one heart,
11 1499 Two of the first life coats in Heraldry,
11 1500 Due but to one and crowned with one crest.
11 1501 And will you rent our ancient loue asunder,
11 1502 To ioyne with men in scorning your poore friend?
11 1503 It is not friendly, 'tis not maidenly.
11 1504 Our sexe as well as I, may chide you for it,
11 1505 Though I alone doe feele the iniurie
11 1506 
11 1507    Her. I am amazed at your passionate words,
11 1508 I scorne you not; It seemes that you scorne me
11 1509 
11 1510    Hel. Haue you not set Lysander, as in scorne
11 1511 To follow me, and praise my eies and face?
11 1512 And made your other loue, Demetrius
11 1513 (Who euen but now did spurne me with his foote)
11 1514 To call me goddesse, nimph, diuine, and rare,
11 1515 Precious, celestiall? Wherefore speakes he this
11 1516 To her he hates? and wherefore doth Lysander
11 1517 Denie your loue (so rich within his soule)
11 1518 And tender me (forsooth) affection,
11 1519 But by your setting on, by your consent?
11 1520 What though I be not so in grace as you,
11 1521 So hung vpon with loue, so fortunate?
11 1522 (But miserable most, to loue vnlou'd)
11 1523 This you should pittie, rather then despise
11 1524 
11 1525    Her. I vnderstand not what you meane by this
11 1526 
11 1527    Hel. I, doe, perseuer, counterfeit sad lookes,
11 1528 Make mouthes vpon me when I turne my backe,
11 1529 Winke each at other, hold the sweete iest vp:
11 1530 This sport well carried, shall be chronicled.
11 1531 If you haue any pittie, grace, or manners,
11 1532 You would not make me such an argument:
11 1533 But fare ye well, 'tis partly mine owne fault,
11 1534 Which death or absence soone shall remedie
11 1535 
11 1536    Lys. Stay gentle Helena, heare my excuse,
11 1537 My loue, my life, my soule, faire Helena
11 1538 
11 1539    Hel. O excellent!
11 1540   Her. Sweete, do not scorne her so
11 1541 
11 1542    Dem. If she cannot entreate, I can compell
11 1543 
11 1544    Lys. Thou canst compell, no more then she entreate.
11 1545 Thy threats haue no more strength then her weak praise.
11 1546 Helen, I loue thee, by my life I doe;
11 1547 I sweare by that which I will lose for thee,
11 1548 To proue him false, that saies I loue thee not
11 1549 
11 1550    Dem. I say, I loue thee more then he can do
11 1551 
11 1552    Lys. If thou say so, withdraw and proue it too
11 1553 
11 1554    Dem. Quick, come
11 1555 
11 1556    Her. Lysander, whereto tends all this?
11 1557   Lys. Away, you Ethiope
11 1558 
11 1559    Dem. No, no, Sir, seeme to breake loose;
11 1560 Take on as you would follow,
11 1561 But yet come not: you are a tame man, go
11 1562 
11 1563    Lys. Hang off thou cat, thou bur; vile thing let loose,
11 1564 Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent
11 1565 
11 1566    Her. Why are you growne so rude?
11 1567 What change is this sweete Loue?
11 1568   Lys. Thy loue? out tawny Tartar, out;
11 1569 Out loathed medicine; O hated poison hence
11 1570 
11 1571    Her. Do you not iest?
11 1572   Hel. Yes sooth, and so do you
11 1573 
11 1574    Lys. Demetrius: I will keepe my word with thee
11 1575 
11 1576    Dem. I would I had your bond: for I perceiue
11 1577 A weake bond holds you; Ile not trust your word
11 1578 
11 1579    Lys. What, should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead?
11 1580 Although I hate her, Ile not harme her so
11 1581 
11 1582    Her. What, can you do me greater harme then hate?
11 1583 Hate me, wherefore? O me, what newes my Loue?
11 1584 Am not I Hermia? Are not you Lysander?
11 1585 I am as faire now, as I was ere while.
11 1586 Since night you lou'd me: yet since night you left me.
11 1587 Why then you left me (O the gods forbid)
11 1588 In earnest, shall I say?
11 1589   Lys. I, by my life;
11 1590 And neuer did desire to see thee more.
11 1591 Therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt;
11 1592 Be certaine, nothing truer: 'tis no iest,
11 1593 That I do hate thee, and loue Helena
11 1594 
11 1595    Her. O me, you iugler, you canker blossome,
11 1596 You theefe of loue; What, haue you come by night,
11 1597 And stolne my loues heart from him?
11 1598   Hel. Fine yfaith:
11 1599 Haue you no modesty, no maiden shame,
11 1600 No touch of bashfulnesse? What, will you teare
11 1601 Impatient answers from my gentle tongue?
11 1602 Fie, fie, you counterfeit, you puppet, you
11 1603 
11 1604    Her. Puppet? why so? I, that way goes the game.
11 1605 Now I perceiue that she hath made compare
11 1606 Betweene our statures, she hath vrg'd her height,
11 1607 And with her personage, her tall personage,
11 1608 Her height (forsooth) she hath preuail'd with him.
11 1609 And are you growne so high in his esteeme,
11 1610 Because I am so dwarfish, and so low?
11 1611 How low am I, thou painted May-pole? Speake,
11 1612 How low am I? I am not yet so low,
11 1613 But that my nailes can reach vnto thine eyes
11 1614 
11 1615    Hel. I pray you though you mocke me, gentlemen,
11 1616 Let her not hurt me; I was neuer curst:
11 1617 I haue no gift at all in shrewishnesse;
11 1618 I am a right maide for my cowardize;
11 1619 Let her not strike me: you perhaps may thinke,
11 1620 Because she is something lower then my selfe,
11 1621 That I can match her
11 1622 
11 1623    Her. Lower? harke againe
11 1624 
11 1625    Hel. Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me,
11 1626 I euermore did loue you Hermia,
11 1627 Did euer keepe your counsels, neuer wronged you,
11 1628 Saue that in loue vnto Demetrius,
11 1629 I told him of your stealth vnto this wood.
11 1630 He followed you, for loue I followed him,
11 1631 But he hath chid me hence, and threatned me
11 1632 To strike me, spurne me, nay to kill me too;
11 1633 And now, so you will let me quiet go,
11 1634 To Athens will I beare my folly backe,
11 1635 And follow you no further. Let me go.
11 1636 You see how simple, and how fond I am
11 1637 
11 1638    Her. Why get you gone: who ist that hinders you?
11 1639   Hel. A foolish heart, that I leaue here behinde
11 1640 
11 1641    Her. What, with Lysander?
11 1642   Her. With Demetrius
11 1643 
11 1644    Lys. Be not afraid, she shall not harme thee Helena
11 1645 
11 1646    Dem. No sir, she shall not, though you take her part
11 1647 
11 1648    Hel. O when she's angry, she is keene and shrewd,
11 1649 She was a vixen when she went to schoole,
11 1650 And though she be but little, she is fierce
11 1651 
11 1652    Her. Little againe? Nothing but low and little?
11 1653 Why will you suffer her to flout me thus?
11 1654 Let me come to her
11 1655 
11 1656    Lys. Get you gone you dwarfe,
11 1657 You minimus, of hindring knot-grasse made,
11 1658 You bead, you acorne
11 1659 
11 1660    Dem. You are too officious,
11 1661 In her behalfe that scornes your seruices.
11 1662 Let her alone, speake not of Helena,
11 1663 Take not her part. For if thou dost intend
11 1664 Neuer so little shew of loue to her,
11 1665 Thou shalt abide it
11 1666 
11 1667    Lys. Now she holds me not,
11 1668 Now follow if thou dar'st, to try whose right,
11 1669 Of thine or mine is most in Helena
11 1670 
11 1671    Dem. Follow? Nay, Ile goe with thee cheeke by
11 1672 iowle.
11 1673 
11 1674 Exit Lysander and Demetrius.
11 1675 
11 1676   Her. You Mistris, all this coyle is long of you.
11 1677 Nay, goe not backe
11 1678 
11 1679    Hel. I will not trust you I,
11 1680 Nor longer stay in your curst companie.
11 1681 Your hands then mine, are quicker for a fray,
11 1682 My legs are longer though to runne away.
11 1683 Enter Oberon and Pucke.
11 1684 
11 1685   Ob. This is thy negligence, still thou mistak'st,
11 1686 Or else committ'st thy knaueries willingly
11 1687 
11 1688    Puck. Beleeue me, King of shadowes, I mistooke,
11 1689 Did not you tell me, I should know the man,
11 1690 By the Athenian garments he hath on?
11 1691 And so farre blamelesse proues my enterprize,
11 1692 That I haue nointed an Athenians eies,
11 1693 And so farre am I glad, it so did sort,
11 1694 As this their iangling I esteeme a sport
11 1695 
11 1696    Ob. Thou seest these Louers seeke a place to fight,
11 1697 Hie therefore Robin, ouercast the night,
11 1698 The starrie Welkin couer thou anon,
11 1699 With drooping fogge as blacke as Acheron,
11 1700 And lead these testie Riuals so astray,
11 1701 As one come not within anothers way.
11 1702 Like to Lysander, sometime frame thy tongue,
11 1703 Then stirre Demetrius vp with bitter wrong;
11 1704 And sometime raile thou like Demetrius;
11 1705 And from each other looke thou leade them thus,
11 1706 Till ore their browes, death-counterfeiting, sleepe
11 1707 With leaden legs, and Battie-wings doth creepe:
11 1708 Then crush this hearbe into Lysanders eie,
11 1709 Whose liquor hath this vertuous propertie,
11 1710 To take from thence all error, with his might,
11 1711 and make his eie-bals role with wonted sight.
11 1712 When they next wake, all this derision
11 1713 Shall seeme a dreame, and fruitless vision,
11 1714 And backe to Athens shall the Louers wend
11 1715 With league, whose date till death shall neuer end.
11 1716 Whiles I in this affaire do thee imploy,
11 1717 Ile to my Queene, and beg her Indian Boy;
11 1718 And then I will her charmed eie release
11 1719 From monsters view, and all things shall be peace
11 1720 
11 1721    Puck. My Fairie Lord, this must be done with haste,
11 1722 For night-swift Dragons cut the Clouds full fast,
11 1723 And yonder shines Auroras harbinger;
11 1724 At whose approach Ghosts wandring here and there,
11 1725 Troope home to Church-yards; damned spirits all,
11 1726 That in crosse-waies and flouds haue buriall,
11 1727 Alreadie to their wormie beds are gone;
11 1728 For feare least day should looke their shames vpon,
11 1729 They wilfully themselues exile from light,
11 1730 And must for aye consort with blacke browd night
11 1731 
11 1732    Ob. But we are spirits of another sort:
11 1733 I, with the mornings loue haue oft made sport,
11 1734 And like a Forrester, the groues may tread,
11 1735 Euen till the Easterne gate all fierie red,
11 1736 Opening on Neptune, With faire blessed beames,
11 1737 Turnes into yellow gold, his salt greene streames.
11 1738 But not withstanding haste, make no delay:
11 1739 We may effect this businesse, yet ere day
11 1740 
11 1741    Puck. Vp and downe, vp and downe, I will leade
11 1742 them vp and downe: I am fear'd in field and towne.
11 1743 Goblin, lead them vp and downe: here comes one.
11 1744 Enter Lysander.
11 1745 
11 1746   Lys. Where art thou, proud Demetrius?
11 1747 Speake thou now
11 1748 
11 1749    Rob. Here villaine, drawne & readie. Where art thou?
11 1750   Lys. I will be with thee straight
11 1751 
11 1752    Rob. Follow me then to plainer ground.
11 1753 Enter Demetrius.
11 1754 
11 1755   Dem. Lysander, speake againe;
11 1756 Thou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled?
11 1757 Speake in some bush: Where dost thou hide thy head?
11 1758   Rob. Thou coward, art thou bragging to the stars,
11 1759 Telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars,
11 1760 And wilt not come? Come recreant, come thou childe,
11 1761 Ile whip thee with a rod. He is defil'd
11 1762 That drawes a sword on thee
11 1763 
11 1764    Dem. Yea, art thou there?
11 1765   Ro. Follow my voice, we'l try no manhood here.
11 1766 Enter.
11 1767 
11 1768   Lys. He goes before me, and still dares me on,
11 1769 When I come where he cals, then he's gone.
11 1770 The Villaine is much lighter heel'd then I:
11 1771 I followed fast, but faster he did flye;
11 1772 
11 1773 shifting places.
11 1774 
11 1775 That fallen am I in darke vneuen way,
11 1776 And here wil rest me. Come thou gentle day:
11 1777 
11 1778 lye down.
11 1779 
11 1780 For if but once thou shew me thy gray light,
11 1781 Ile finde Demetrius, and reuenge this spight.
11 1782 Enter Robin and Demetrius.
11 1783 
11 1784   Rob. Ho, ho, ho; coward, why com'st thou not?
11 1785   Dem. Abide me, if thou dar'st. For well I wot,
11 1786 Thou runst before me, shifting euery place,
11 1787 And dar'st not stand, nor looke me in the face.
11 1788 Where art thou?
11 1789   Rob. Come hither, I am here
11 1790 
11 1791    Dem. Nay then thou mock'st me; thou shalt buy this
11 1792 deere,
11 1793 If euer I thy face by day-light see.
11 1794 Now goe thy way: faintnesse constraineth me,
11 1795 To measure out my length on this cold bed,
11 1796 By daies approach looke to be visited.
11 1797 Enter Helena.
11 1798 
11 1799   Hel. O weary night, O long and tedious night,
11 1800 Abate thy houres, shine comforts from the East,
11 1801 That I may backe to Athens by day-light,
11 1802 From these that my poore companie detest;
11 1803 And sleepe that sometime shuts vp sorrowes eie,
11 1804 Steale me a while from mine owne companie.
11 1805 
11 1806 Sleepe.
11 1807 
11 1808   Rob. Yet but three? Come one more,
11 1809 Two of both kindes makes vp foure.
11 1810 Here she comes, curst and sad,
11 1811 Cupid is a knauish lad,
11 1812 Enter Hermia.
11 1813 
11 1814 Thus to make poore females mad
11 1815 
11 1816    Her. Neuer so wearie, neuer so in woe,
11 1817 Bedabbled with the dew, and torne with briars,
11 1818 I can no further crawle, no further goe;
11 1819 My legs can keepe no pace with my desires.
11 1820 Here will I rest me till the breake of day,
11 1821 Heauens shield Lysander, if they meane a fray
11 1822 
11 1823    Rob. On the ground sleepe sound,
11 1824 Ile apply your eie gentle louer, remedy.
11 1825 When thou wak'st, thou tak'st
11 1826 True delight in the sight of thy former Ladies eye,
11 1827 And the Country Prouerb knowne,
11 1828 That euery man should take his owne,
11 1829 In your waking shall be showne.
11 1830 Iacke shall haue Iill, nought shall goe ill.
11 1831 The man shall haue his Mare againe, and all shall bee
11 1832 well.
11 1833 
11 1834 They sleepe all the Act.
11 1835 
11 1836 
11 1837 Actus Quartus.
11 1838 
11 1839 Enter Queene of Fairies, and Clowne, and Fairies, and the King
11 1840 behinde
11 1841 them.
11 1842 
11 1843   Tita. Come, sit thee downe vpon this flowry bed,
11 1844 While I thy amiable cheekes doe coy,
11 1845 And sticke muske roses in thy sleeke smoothe head,
11 1846 And kisse thy faire large eares, my gentle ioy
11 1847 
11 1848    Clow. Where's Peaseblossome?
11 1849   Peas. Ready
11 1850 
11 1851    Clow. Scratch my head, Pease-blossome. Wher's Mounsieuer
11 1852 Cobweb

11 1856    Clowne. Mounsieur Cobweb, good Mounsier get your
11 1857 weapons in your hand, & kill me a red hipt humble-Bee,
11 1858 on the top of a thistle; and good Mounsieur bring mee

11 1860 action, Mounsieur; and good mounsieur haue a care the

11 1867 Pray you leaue your courtesie good Mounsieur
11 1868 
11 1869    Mus. What's your will?
11 1870   Clo. Nothing good Mounsieur, but to help Caualery
11 1871 Cobweb to scratch. I must to the Barbers Mounsieur, for
11 1872 me-thinkes I am maruellous hairy about the face. And I
11 1873 am such a tender asse, if my haire do but tickle me, I must
11 1874 scratch
11 1875 
11 1876    Tita. What, wilt thou heare some musicke, my sweet
11 1877 loue
11 1878 
11 1879    Clow. I haue a reasonable good eare in musicke. Let
11 1880 vs haue the tongs and the bones.
11 1881 
11 1882 Musicke Tongs, Rurall Musicke.
11 1883 
11 1884   Tita. Or say sweete Loue, what thou desirest to eat
11 1885 
11 1886    Clowne. Truly a pecke of Prouender; I could munch
11 1887 your good dry Oates. Me-thinkes I haue a great desire
11 1888 to a bottle of hay: good hay, sweete hay hath no fellow
11 1889 
11 1890    Tita. I haue a venturous Fairy,
11 1891 That shall seeke the Squirrels hoard,
11 1892 And fetch thee new Nuts
11 1893 
11 1894    Clown. I had rather haue a handfull or two of dried
11 1895 pease. But I pray you let none of your people stirre me, I
11 1896 haue an exposition of sleepe come vpon me
11 1897 
11 1898    Tyta. Sleepe thou, and I will winde thee in my arms,
11 1899 Fairies be gone, and be alwaies away.
11 1900 So doth the woodbine, the sweet Honisuckle,
11 1901 Gently entwist; the female Iuy so
11 1902 Enrings the barky fingers of the Elme.
11 1903 O how I loue thee! how I dote on thee!
11 1904 Enter Robin goodfellow and Oberon.
11 1905 
11 1906   Ob. Welcome good Robin:
11 1907 Seest thou this sweet sight?
11 1908 Her dotage now I doe begin to pitty.
11 1909 For meeting her of late behinde the wood,
11 1910 Seeking sweet sauours for this hatefull foole,
11 1911 I did vpbraid her, and fall out with her.
11 1912 For she his hairy temples then had rounded,
11 1913 With coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers.
11 1914 And that same dew which somtime on the buds,
11 1915 Was wont to swell like round and orient pearles;
11 1916 Stood now within the pretty flouriets eyes,
11 1917 Like teares that did their owne disgrace bewaile.
11 1918 When I had at my pleasure taunted her,
11 1919 And she in milde termes beg'd my patience,
11 1920 I then did aske of her, her changeling childe,
11 1921 Which straight she gaue me, and her fairy sent
11 1922 To beare him to my Bower in Fairy Land.
11 1923 And now I haue the Boy, I will vndoe
11 1924 This hatefull imperfection of her eyes.
11 1925 And gentle Pucke, take this transformed scalpe,
11 1926 From off the head of this Athenian swaine;
11 1927 That he awaking when the other doe,
11 1928 May all to Athens backe againe repaire,
11 1929 And thinke no more of this nights accidents,
11 1930 But as the fierce vexation of dreame.
11 1931 But first I will release the Fairy Queene.
11 1932 Be thou as thou wast wont to be;
11 1933 See as thou wast wont to see.
11 1934 Dians bud, or Cupids flower,
11 1935 Hath such force and blessed power.
11 1936 Now my Titania wake you my sweet Queene
11 1937 
11 1938    Tita. My Oberon, what visions haue I seene!
11 1939 Me-thought I was enamoured of an asse
11 1940 
11 1941    Ob. There lies your loue
11 1942 
11 1943    Tita. How came these things to passe?
11 1944 Oh, how mine eyes doth loath this visage now!
11 1945   Ob. Silence a while. Robin take off his head:
11 1946 Titania, musick call, and strike more dead
11 1947 Then common sleepe; of all these, fine the sense
11 1948 
11 1949    Tita. Musicke, ho musicke, such as charmeth sleepe.
11 1950 
11 1951 Musick still.
11 1952 
11 1953   Rob. When thou wak'st, with thine owne fooles eies
11 1954 peepe
11 1955 
11 1956    Ob. Sound musick; come my Queen, take hands with me
11 1957 And rocke the ground whereon these sleepers be.
11 1958 Now thou and I new in amity,
11 1959 And will to morrow midnight, solemnly
11 1960 Dance in Duke Theseus house triumphantly,
11 1961 And blesse it to all faire posterity.
11 1962 There shall the paires of faithfull Louers be
11 1963 Wedded, with Theseus, all in iollity
11 1964 
11 1965    Rob. Faire King attend, and marke,
11 1966 I doe heare the morning Larke,
11 1967   Ob. Then my Queene in silence sad,
11 1968 Trip we after the nights shade;
11 1969 We the Globe can compasse soone,
11 1970 Swifter then the wandering Moone
11 1971 
11 1972    Tita. Come my Lord, and in our flight,
11 1973 Tell me how it came this night,
11 1974 That I sleeping heere was found,
11 1975 
11 1976 Sleepers Lye still.
11 1977 
11 1978 With these mortals on the ground.
11 1979 
11 1980 Exeunt.
11 1981 
11 1982 Winde Hornes.
11 1983 
11 1984 Enter Theseus, Egeus, Hippolita and all his traine.
11 1985 
11 1986   Thes. Goe one of you, finde out the Forrester,
11 1987 For now our obseruation is perform'd;
11 1988 And since we haue the vaward of the day,
11 1989 My Loue shall heare the musicke of my hounds.
11 1990 Vncouple in the Westerne valley, let them goe;
11 1991 Dispatch I say, and finde the Forrester.
11 1992 We will faire Queene, vp to the Mountains top,
11 1993 And marke the musicall confusion
11 1994 Of hounds and eccho in coniunction
11 1995 
11 1996    Hip. I was with Hercules and Cadmus once.
11 1997 When in a wood of Creete they bayed the Beare
11 1998 With hounds of Sparta; neuer did I heare
11 1999 Such gallant chiding. For besides the groues,
11 2000 The skies, the fountaines, euery region neere,
11 2001 Seeme all one mutuall cry. I neuer heard
11 2002 So musicall a discord, such sweet thunder
11 2003 
11 2004    Thes. My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kinde,
11 2005 So flew'd, so sanded, and their heads are hung
11 2006 With eares that sweepe away the morning dew,
11 2007 Crooke kneed, and dew-lapt, like Thessalian Buls,
11 2008 Slow in pursuit, but match'd in mouth like bels,
11 2009 Each vnder each. A cry more tuneable
11 2010 Was neuer hallowed to, nor cheer'd with horne,
11 2011 In Creete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly;
11 2012 Iudge when you heare. But soft, what nimphs are these?
11 2013   Egeus. My Lord, this is my daughter heere asleepe,
11 2014 And this Lysander, this Demetrius is,
11 2015 This Helena, olde Nedars Helena,
11 2016 I wonder of this being heere together
11 2017 
11 2018    The. No doubt they rose vp early, to obserue
11 2019 The right of May; and hearing our intent,
11 2020 Came heere in grace of our solemnity.
11 2021 But speake Egeus, is not this the day
11 2022 That Hermia should giue answer of her choice?
11 2023   Egeus. It is, my Lord
11 2024 
11 2025    Thes. Goe bid the hunts-men wake them with their
11 2026 hornes.
11 2027 
11 2028 Hornes and they wake.
11 2029 
11 2030 Shout within, they all start vp.
11 2031 
11 2032   Thes. Good morrow friends: Saint Valentine is past,
11 2033 Begin these wood birds but to couple now?
11 2034   Lys. Pardon my Lord
11 2035 
11 2036    Thes. I pray you all stand vp.
11 2037 I know you two are Riuall enemies.
11 2038 How comes this gentle concord in the world,
11 2039 That hatred is so farre from iealousie,
11 2040 To sleepe by hate, and feare no enmity
11 2041 
11 2042    Lys. My Lord, I shall reply amazedly,
11 2043 Halfe sleepe, halfe waking. but as yet, I sweare,
11 2044 I cannot truly say how I came heere.
11 2045 But as I thinke (for truly would I speake)
11 2046 And now I doe bethinke me, so it is;
11 2047 I came with Hermia hither. Our intent
11 2048 Was to be gone from Athens, where we might be
11 2049 Without the perill of the Athenian Law
11 2050 
11 2051    Ege. Enough, enough, my Lord: you haue enough;
11 2052 I beg the Law, the Law, vpon his head:
11 2053 They would have stolne away, they would Demetrius,
11 2054 Thereby to haue defeated you and me:
11 2055 You of your wife, and me of my consent;
11 2056 Of my consent, that she should be your wife
11 2057 
11 2058    Dem. My Lord, faire Helen told me of their stealth,
11 2059 Of this their purpose hither, to this wood,
11 2060 And I in furie hither followed them;
11 2061 Faire Helena, in fancy followed me.
11 2062 But my good Lord, I wot not by what not by what power,
11 2063 (But by some power it is) my loue
11 2064 To Hermia (melted as the snow)
11 2065 Seems to me now as the remembrance of an idle gaude,
11 2066 Which in my childehood I did doat vpon:
11 2067 And all the faith, the vertue of my heart,
11 2068 The obiect and the pleasure of mine eye,
11 2069 Is onely Helena. To her, my Lord,
11 2070 Was I betroth'd, ere I see Hermia,
11 2071 But like a sickenesse did I loath this food,
11 2072 But as in health, come to my naturall taste,
11 2073 Now doe I wish it, loue it, long for it,
11 2074 And will for euermore be true to it
11 2075 
11 2076    Thes. Faire Louers, you are fortunately met;
11 2077 Of this discourse we shall heare more anon.
11 2078 Egeus, I will ouer-beare your will;
11 2079 For in the Temple, by and by with vs,
11 2080 These couples shall eternally be knit.
11 2081 And for the morning now is something worne,
11 2082 Our purpos'd hunting shall be set aside.
11 2083 Away, with vs to Athens; three and three,
11 2084 Wee'll hold a feast in great solemnitie.
11 2085 Come Hippolita.
11 2086 
11 2087 Exit Duke and Lords.
11 2088 
11 2089   Dem. These things seeme small & vndistinguishable,
11 2090 Like farre off mountaines turned into Clouds
11 2091 
11 2092    Her. Me-thinks I see these things with parted eye,
11 2093 When euery thing seemes double
11 2094 
11 2095    Hel. So me-thinkes:
11 2096 And I haue found Demetrius, like a iewell,
11 2097 Mine owne, and not mine owne
11 2098 
11 2099    Dem. It seemes to mee,
11 2100 That yet we sleepe, we dreame. Do not you thinke,
11 2101 The Duke was heere, and bid vs follow him?
11 2102   Her. Yea, and my Father
11 2103 
11 2104    Hel. And Hippolita
11 2105 
11 2106    Lys. And he bid vs follow to the Temple
11 2107 
11 2108    Dem. Why then we are awake; lets follow him, and
11 2109 by the way let vs recount our dreames.
11 2110 
11 2111 Bottome wakes.
11 2112 
11 2113 Exit Louers.
11 2114 
11 2115   Clo. When my cue comes, call me, and I will answer.
11 2116 My next is, most faire Piramus. Hey ho. Peter Quince?
11 2117 Flute the bellowes-mender? Snout the tinker? Starueling?
11 2118 Gods my life! Stolne hence, and left me asleepe: I
11 2119 haue had a most rare vision. I had a dreame, past the wit
11 2120 of man, to say, what dreame it was. Man is but an Asse,
11 2121 if he goe about to expound this dreame. Me-thought I
11 2122 was, there is no man can tell what. Me-thought I was,
11 2123 and me-thought I had. But man is but a patch'd foole,
11 2124 if he will offer to say, what me-thought I had. The eye of
11 2125 man hath not heard, the eare of man hath not seen, mans
11 2126 hand is not able to taste, his tongue to conceiue, nor his
11 2127 heart to report, what my dreame was. I will get Peter
11 2128 Quince to write a ballet of this dreame, it shall be called
11 2129 Bottomes Dreame, because it hath no bottome; and I will
11 2130 sing it in the latter end of a play, before the Duke. Peraduenture,
11 2131 to make it the more gracious, I shall sing it
11 2132 at her death.
11 2133 Enter.
11 2134 
11 2135 Enter Quince, Flute, Thisbie, Snout, and Starueling.
11 2136 
11 2137   Quin. Haue you sent to Bottomes house? Is he come
11 2138 home yet?
11 2139   Staru. He cannot be heard of. Out of doubt hee is
11 2140 transported
11 2141 
11 2142    This. If he come not, then the play is mar'd. It goes
11 2143 not forward, doth it?
11 2144   Quin. It is not possible: you haue not a man in all
11 2145 Athens, able to discharge Piramus but he
11 2146 
11 2147    This. No, hee hath simply the best wit of any handycraft
11 2148 man in Athens
11 2149 
11 2150    Quin. Yea, and the best person too, and hee is a very
11 2151 Paramour, for a sweet voyce
11 2152 
11 2153    This. You must say, Paragon. A Paramour is (God
11 2154 blesse vs) a thing of nought.
11 2155 Enter Snug the Ioyner.
11 2156 
11 2157   Snug. Masters, the Duke is comming from the Temple,
11 2158 and there is two or three Lords & Ladies more married.
11 2159 If our sport had gone forward, we had all bin made
11 2160 men
11 2161 
11 2162    This. O sweet bully Bottome: thus hath he lost sixepence
11 2163 a day, during his life; he could not haue scaped sixpence
11 2164 a day. And the Duke had not giuen him sixpence
11 2165 a day for playing Piramus, Ile be hang'd. He would haue
11 2166 deserued it. Sixpence a day in Piramus, or nothing.
11 2167 Enter Bottome.
11 2168 
11 2169   Bot. Where are these Lads? Where are these hearts?
11 2170   Quin. Bottome, o most couragious day! O most happie
11 2171 houre!
11 2172   Bot. Masters, I am to discourse wonders; but ask me
11 2173 not what. For if I tell you, I am no true Athenian. I
11 2174 will tell you euery thing as it fell out
11 2175 
11 2176    Qu. Let vs heare, sweet Bottome
11 2177 
11 2178    Bot. Not a word of me: all that I will tell you, is, that
11 2179 the Duke hath dined. Get your apparell together, good
11 2180 strings to your beards, new ribbands to your pumps,
11 2181 meete presently at the Palace, euery man looke ore his
11 2182 part: for the short and the long is, our play is preferred:
11 2183 In any case let Thisby haue cleane linnen: and let not him
11 2184 that playes the Lion, paire his nailes, for they shall hang
11 2185 out for the Lions clawes. And most deare Actors, eate
11 2186 no Onions, nor Garlicke; for wee are to vtter sweete
11 2187 breath, and I doe not doubt but to heare them say, it is a
11 2188 sweet Comedy. No more words: away, go away.
11 2189 
11 2190 Exeunt.
11 2191 
11 2192 
11 2193 Actus Quintus.
11 2194 
11 2195 Enter Theseus, Hippolita, Egeus and his Lords.
11 2196 
11 2197   Hip. 'Tis strange my Theseus, y these louers speake of
11 2198 
11 2199    The. More strange then true. I neuer may beleeue
11 2200 These anticke fables, nor these Fairy toyes,
11 2201 Louers and mad men haue such seething braines,
11 2202 Such shaping phantasies, that apprehend more
11 2203 Then coole reason euer comprehends.
11 2204 The Lunaticke, the Louer, and the Poet,
11 2205 Are of imagination all compact.
11 2206 One sees more diuels then vaste hell can hold;
11 2207 That is the mad man. The Louer, all as franticke,
11 2208 Sees Helens beauty in a brow of Egipt.
11 2209 The Poets eye in a fine frenzy rolling, doth glance
11 2210 From heauen to earth, from earth to heauen.
11 2211 And as imagination bodies forth the forms of things
11 2212 Vnknowne; the Poets pen turnes them to shapes,
11 2213 And giues to aire nothing, a locall habitation,
11 2214 And a name. Such tricks hath strong imagination,
11 2215 That if it would but apprehend some ioy,
11 2216 It comprehends some bringer of that ioy.
11 2217 Or in the night, imagining some feare,
11 2218 Howe easie is a bush suppos'd a Beare?
11 2219   Hip. But all the storie of the night told ouer,
11 2220 And all their minds transfigur'd so together,
11 2221 More witnesseth than fancies images,
11 2222 And growes to something of great constancie;
11 2223 But howsoeuer, strange, and admirable.
11 2224 Enter louers, Lysander, Demetrius, Hermia, and Helena.
11 2225 
11 2226   The. Heere come the louers, full of ioy and mirth:
11 2227 Ioy, gentle friends, ioy and fresh dayes
11 2228 Of loue accompany your hearts
11 2229 
11 2230    Lys. More then to vs, waite in your royall walkes,
11 2231 your boord, your bed
11 2232 
11 2233    The. Come now, what maskes, what dances shall
11 2234 we haue,
11 2235 To weare away this long age of three houres,
11 2236 Between our after supper, and bed-time?
11 2237 Where is our vsuall manager of mirth?
11 2238 What Reuels are in hand? Is there no play,
11 2239 To ease the anguish of a torturing houre?
11 2240 Call Egeus
11 2241 
11 2242    Ege. Heere mighty Theseus
11 2243 
11 2244    The. Say, what abridgement haue you for this euening?
11 2245 What maske? What musicke? How shall we beguile
11 2246 The lazie time, if not with some delight?
11 2247   Ege. There is a breefe how many sports are rife:
11 2248 Make choise of which your Highnesse will see first
11 2249 
11 2250    Lis. The battell with the Centaurs to be sung
11 2251 By an Athenian Eunuch, to the Harpe
11 2252 
11 2253    The. Wee'l none of that. That haue I told my Loue
11 2254 In glory of my kinsman Hercules
11 2255 
11 2256    Lis. The riot of the tipsie Bachanals,
11 2257 Tearing the Thracian singer, in their rage?
11 2258   The. That is an old deuice, and it was plaid
11 2259 When I from Thebes came last a Conqueror
11 2260 
11 2261    Lis. The thrice three Muses, mourning for the death
11 2262 of learning, late deceast in beggerie
11 2263 
11 2264    The. That is some Satire keene and criticall,
11 2265 Not sorting with a nuptiall ceremonie
11 2266 
11 2267    Lis. A tedious breefe Scene of yong Piramus,
11 2268 And his loue Thisby; very tragicall mirth
11 2269 
11 2270    The. Merry and tragicall? Tedious, and briefe? That
11 2271 is, hot ice, and wondrous strange snow. How shall wee
11 2272 finde the concord of this discord?
11 2273   Ege. A play there is, my Lord, some ten words long,
11 2274 Which is as breefe, as I haue knowne a play;
11 2275 But by ten words, my Lord, it is too long;
11 2276 Which makes it tedious. For in all the play,
11 2277 There is not one word apt, one Player fitted.
11 2278 And tragicall my noble Lord it is: for Piramus
11 2279 Therein doth kill himselfe. Which when I saw
11 2280 Rehearst, I must confesse, made mine eyes water:
11 2281 But more merrie teares, the passion of loud laughter
11 2282 Neuer shed
11 2283 
11 2284    Thes. What are they that do play it?
11 2285   Ege. Hard handed men, that worke in Athens heere,
11 2286 Which neuer labour'd in their mindes till now;
11 2287 And now haue toyled their vnbreathed memories
11 2288 With this same play, against your nuptiall
11 2289 
11 2290    The. And we will heare it
11 2291 
11 2292    Hip. No my noble Lord, it is not for you. I haue heard
11 2293 It ouer, and it is nothing, nothing in the world;
11 2294 Vnless you can finde sport in their intents,
11 2295 Extreamely stretched, and cond with cruell paine,
11 2296 To doe you seruice
11 2297 
11 2298    Thes. I will heare that play. For neuer any thing
11 2299 Can be amisse, when simplenesse and duty tender it.
11 2300 Goe bring them in, and take your places, Ladies
11 2301 
11 2302    Hip. I loue not to see wretchednesse orecharged;
11 2303 And duty in his seruice perishing
11 2304 
11 2305    Thes. Why gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing
11 2306 
11 2307    Hip. He saies, they can doe nothing in this kinde
11 2308 
11 2309    Thes. The kinder we, to giue them thanks for nothing
11 2310 Our sport shall be, to take what they mistake;
11 2311 And what poore duty cannot doe, noble respect
11 2312 Takes it in might, not merit.
11 2313 Where I haue come, great Clearkes haue purposed
11 2314 To greete me with premeditated welcomes;
11 2315 Where I haue seene them shiuer and looke pale,
11 2316 Make periods in the midst of sentences,
11 2317 Throttle their practiz'd accent in their feares,
11 2318 And in conclusion, dumbly haue broke off,
11 2319 Not paying me a welcome. Trust me sweete,
11 2320 Out of this silence yet, I pickt a welcome:
11 2321 And in the modesty of fearefull duty,
11 2322 I read as much, as from the ratling tongue
11 2323 Of saucy and audacious eloquence.
11 2324 Loue therefore, and tongue-tide simplicity,
11 2325 In least, speake most, to my capacity
11 2326 
11 2327    Egeus. So please your Grace, the Prologue is addrest
11 2328 
11 2329    Duke. Let him approach.
11 2330 
11 2331 Flor. Trum.
11 2332 
11 2333 Enter the Prologue. Quince.
11 2334 
11 2335   Pro. If we offend, it is with our good will.
11 2336 That you should thinke, we come not to offend,
11 2337 But with good will. To shew our simple skill,
11 2338 That is the true beginning of our end.
11 2339 Consider then, we come but in despight.
11 2340 We do not come, as minding to content you,
11 2341 Our true intent is. All for your delight,
11 2342 We are not heere. That you should here repent you,
11 2343 The Actors are at hand; and by their show,
11 2344 You shall know all, that you are like to know
11 2345 
11 2346    Thes. This fellow doth not stand vpon points
11 2347 
11 2348    Lys. He hath rid his Prologue, like a rough Colt: he
11 2349 knowes not the stop. A good morall my lord. it is not
11 2350 enough to speake, but to speake true
11 2351 
11 2352    Hip. Indeed hee hath plaid on his Prologue, like a
11 2353 childe on a Recorder, a sound, but not in gouernment
11 2354 
11 2355    Thes. His speech was like a tangled chaine: nothing
11 2356 impaired, but all disordered. Who is next?
11 2357 
11 2358 Tawyer with a Trumpet before them.
11 2359 
11 2360 Enter Pyramus and Thisby, Wall, Moone-shine, and Lyon.
11 2361 
11 2362   Prol. Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show,
11 2363 But wonder on, till truth make all things plaine.
11 2364 This man is Piramus, if you would know;
11 2365 This beauteous Lady, Thisby is certaine.
11 2366 This man, with lyme and rough-cast, doth present
11 2367 Wall, that vile wall, which did these louers sunder:
11 2368 And through walls chink (poor soules) they are content
11 2369 To whisper. At the which, let no man wonder.
11 2370 This man, with Lanthorne, dog, and bush of thorne,
11 2371 Presenteth moone-shine. For if you will know,
11 2372 By moone-shine did these Louers thinke no scorne
11 2373 To meet at Ninus toombe, there, there to wooe:
11 2374 This grizly beast (which Lyon hight by name)
11 2375 The trusty Thisby, comming first by night,
11 2376 Did scarre away, or rather did affright:
11 2377 And as she fled, her mantle she did fall;
11 2378 Which Lyon vile with bloody mouth did staine.
11 2379 Anon comes Piramus, sweet youth and tall,
11 2380 And findes his Thisbies Mantle slaine;
11 2381 Whereat, with blade, with bloody blamefull blade,
11 2382 He brauely broacht his boiling bloudy breast,
11 2383 And Thisby, tarrying in Mulberry shade,
11 2384 His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,
11 2385 Let Lyon, Moone-shine, Wall, and Louers twaine,
11 2386 At large discourse, while here they doe remaine.
11 2387 
11 2388 Exit all but Wall.
11 2389 
11 2390   Thes. I wonder if the Lion be to speake
11 2391 
11 2392    Deme. No wonder, my Lord: one Lion may, when
11 2393 many Asses doe.
11 2394 
11 2395 Exit Lyon, Thisbie, and Mooneshine.
11 2396 
11 2397   Wall. In this same Interlude, it doth befall,
11 2398 That I, one Snowt (by name) present a wall:
11 2399 And such a wall, as I would haue you thinke,
11 2400 That had in it a crannied hole or chinke:
11 2401 Through which the Louers, Piramus and Thisbie
11 2402 Did whisper often, very secretly.
11 2403 This loame, this rough-cast, and this stone doth shew,
11 2404 That I am that same Wall; the truth is so.
11 2405 And this the cranny is, right and sinister,
11 2406 Through which the fearfull Louers are to whisper
11 2407 
11 2408    Thes. Would you desire Lime and Haire to speake
11 2409 better?
11 2410   Deme. It is the wittiest partition, that euer I heard
11 2411 discourse, my Lord
11 2412 
11 2413    Thes. Pyramus drawes neere the Wall, silence.
11 2414 Enter Pyramus.
11 2415 
11 2416   Pir. O grim lookt night, o night with hue so blacke,
11 2417 O night, which euer art, when day is not:
11 2418 O night, o night, alacke, alacke, alacke,
11 2419 I feare my Thisbies promise is forgot.
11 2420 And thou o wall, thou sweet and louely wall,
11 2421 That stands between her fathers ground and mine,
11 2422 Thou wall, o Wall, o sweet and louely wall,
11 2423 Shew me thy chinke, to blinke through with mine eine.
11 2424 Thankes courteous wall. Ioue shield thee well for this.
11 2425 But what see I? No Thisbie doe I see.
11 2426 O wicked wall, through whom I see no blisse,
11 2427 Curst be thy stones for thus deceiuing mee
11 2428 
11 2429    Thes. The wall me-thinkes being sensible, should
11 2430 curse againe
11 2431 
11 2432    Pir. No in truth sir, he should not. Deceiuing me,
11 2433 Is Thisbies cue; she is to enter, and I am to spy
11 2434 Her through the wall. You shall see it will fall.
11 2435 Enter Thisbie.
11 2436 
11 2437 Pat as I told you; yonder she comes
11 2438 
11 2439    This. O wall, full often hast thou heard my mones,
11 2440 For parting my faire Piramus, and me
11 2441 My cherry lips haue often kist thy stones;
11 2442 Thy stones with Lime and Haire knit vp in thee
11 2443 
11 2444    Pyra. I see a voyce; now will I to the chinke,
11 2445 To spy and I can heare my Thisbies face. Thisbie?
11 2446   This. My Loue thou art, my Loue I thinke
11 2447 
11 2448    Pir. Thinke what thou wilt, I am thy Louers grace,
11 2449 And like Limander am I trusty still
11 2450 
11 2451    This. And like Helen till the Fates me kill
11 2452 
11 2453    Pir. Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true
11 2454 
11 2455    This. As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you
11 2456 
11 2457    Pir. O kisse me through the hole of this vile wall
11 2458 
11 2459    This. I kisse the wals hole, not your lips at all
11 2460 
11 2461    Pir. Wilt thou at Ninnies tombe meete me straight
11 2462 way?
11 2463   This. Tide life, tide death, I come without delay
11 2464 
11 2465    Wall. Thus haue I Wall, my part discharged so;
11 2466 And being done, thus Wall away doth go.
11 2467 
11 2468 Exit Clow.
11 2469 
11 2470   Du. Now is the morall downe between the two
11 2471 Neighbours
11 2472 
11 2473    Dem. No remedie my Lord, when Wals are so wilfull,
11 2474 to heare without warning
11 2475 
11 2476    Dut. This is the silliest stuffe that ere I heard
11 2477 
11 2478    Du. The best in this kind are but shadowes, and the
11 2479 worst are no worse, if imagination amend them
11 2480 
11 2481    Dut. It must be your imagination then, & not theirs
11 2482 
11 2483    Duk. If wee imagine no worse of them then they of
11 2484 themselues, they may passe for excellent men. Here com
11 2485 two noble beasts, in a man and a Lion.
11 2486 Enter Lyon and Moone-shine
11 2487 
11 2488    Lyon. You Ladies, you (whose gentle harts do feare
11 2489 The smallest monstrous mouse that creepes on floore)
11 2490 May now perchance, both quake and tremble heere,
11 2491 When Lion rough in wildest rage doth roare.
11 2492 Then know that I, one Snug the Ioyner am
11 2493 A Lion fell, nor else no Lions dam:
11 2494 For if I should as Lion come in strife
11 2495 Into this place, 'twere pittie of my life
11 2496 
11 2497    Du. A verie gentle beast, and of good conscience
11 2498 
11 2499    Dem. The verie best at a beast, my Lord, y ere I saw
11 2500 
11 2501    Lis. This Lion is a verie Fox for his valor
11 2502 
11 2503    Du. True, and a Goose for his discretion
11 2504 
11 2505    Dem. Not so my Lord: for his valor cannot carrie
11 2506 his discretion, and the fox carries the Goose
11 2507 
11 2508    Du. His discretion I am sure cannot carrie his valor:
11 2509 for the Goose carries not the Fox. It is well; leaue it to
11 2510 his discretion, and let vs hearken to the Moone
11 2511 
11 2512    Moone. This Lanthorne doth the horned Moone present
11 2513 
11 2514    De. He should haue worne the hornes on his head
11 2515 
11 2516    Du. Hee is no crescent, and his hornes are inuisible,
11 2517 within the circumference
11 2518 
11 2519    Moon. This lanthorne doth the horned Moone present:
11 2520 My selfe, the man i'th Moone doth seeme to be
11 2521 
11 2522    Du. This is the greatest error of all the rest; the man
11 2523 Should be put into the Lanthorne. How is it els the man
11 2524 i'th Moone?
11 2525   Dem. He dares not come there for the candle.
11 2526 For you see, it is already in snuffe
11 2527 
11 2528    Dut. I am wearie of this Moone; would he would
11 2529 change
11 2530 
11 2531    Du. It appeares by his smal light of discretion, that
11 2532 he is in the wane: but yet in courtesie, in all reason, we
11 2533 must stay the time
11 2534 
11 2535    Lys. Proceed Moone
11 2536 
11 2537    Moon. All that I haue to say, is to tell you, that the
11 2538 Lanthorne is the Moone; I, the man in the Moone; this
11 2539 thorne bush; my thorne bush; and this dog, my dog
11 2540 
11 2541    Dem. Why all these should be in the Lanthorne: for
11 2542 they are in the Moone. But silence, heere comes Thisby.
11 2543 Enter Thisby.
11 2544 
11 2545   This. This is old Ninnies tombe: where is my loue?
11 2546   Lyon. Oh.
11 2547 
11 2548 The Lion roares, Thisby runs off.
11 2549 
11 2550   Dem. Well roar'd Lion
11 2551 
11 2552    Du. Well run Thisby
11 2553 
11 2554    Dut. Well shone Moone.
11 2555 Truly the Moone shines with a good grace
11 2556 
11 2557    Du. Wel mouz'd Lion
11 2558 
11 2559    Dem. And then came Piramus
11 2560 
11 2561    Lys. And so the Lion vanisht.
11 2562 Enter Piramus.
11 2563 
11 2564   Pyr. Sweet Moone, I thank thee for thy sunny beames,
11 2565 I thanke thee Moone, for shining now so bright:
11 2566 For by thy gracious, golden, glittering beames,
11 2567 I trust to taste of truest Thisbies sight.
11 2568 But stay: O spight! but marke, poore Knight,
11 2569 What dreadful dole is heere?
11 2570 Eyes do you see! How can it be!
11 2571 O dainty Ducke: O Deere!
11 2572 Thy mantle good; what staind with blood!
11 2573 Approch you furies fell:
11 2574 O Fates! come, come: Cut thred and thrum,
11 2575 Quaile, crush, conclude, and quell
11 2576 
11 2577    Du. This passion, and the death of a deare friend,
11 2578 Would go neere to make a man looke sad
11 2579 
11 2580    Dut. Beshrew my heart, but I pittie the man
11 2581 
11 2582    Pir. O wherefore Nature, did'st thou Lions frame?
11 2583 Since lion vilde hath heere deflour'd my deere:
11 2584 Which is: no, no, which was the fairest Dame
11 2585 That liu'd, that lou'd, that like'd, that look'd with cheere.
11 2586 Come teares, confound: Out sword, and wound
11 2587 The pap of Piramus:
11 2588 I, that left pap, where heart doth hop;
11 2589 Thus dye I, thus, thus, thus.
11 2590 Now am I dead, now am I fled, my soule is in the sky,
11 2591 Tongue lose thy light, Moone take thy flight,
11 2592 Now dye, dye, dye, dye, dye
11 2593 
11 2594    Dem. No Die, but an ace for him; for he is but one
11 2595 
11 2596    Lis. Lesse then an ace man. For he is dead, he is nothing
11 2597 
11 2598    Du. With the helpe of a Surgeon, he might yet recouer,
11 2599 and proue an Asse
11 2600 
11 2601    Dut. How chance Moone-shine is gone before?
11 2602 Thisby comes backe, and findes her Louer.
11 2603 Enter Thisby.
11 2604 
11 2605   Duke. She wil finde him by starre-light.
11 2606 Heere she comes, and her passion ends the play
11 2607 
11 2608    Dut. Me thinkes shee should not vse a long one for
11 2609 such a Piramus: I hope she will be breefe
11 2610 
11 2611    Dem. A Moth wil turne the ballance, which Piramus
11 2612 which Thisby is the better
11 2613 
11 2614    Lys. She hath spyed him already, with those sweete eyes
11 2615 
11 2616    Dem. And thus she meanes, videlicit
11 2617 
11 2618    This. Asleepe my Loue? What, dead my Doue?
11 2619 O Piramus arise:
11 2620 Speake, speake. Quite dumbe? Dead, dead? A tombe
11 2621 Must couer thy sweet eyes.
11 2622 These Lilly Lips, this cherry nose,
11 2623 These yellow Cowslip cheekes
11 2624 Are gone, are gone: Louers make mone:
11 2625 His eyes were greene as Leekes.
11 2626 O Sisters three, come, come to mee,
11 2627 With hands as pale as Milke,
11 2628 Lay them in gore, since you haue shore
11 2629 with sheeres, his thred of silke.
11 2630 Tongue not a word: Come trusty sword:
11 2631 Come blade, my brest imbrue:
11 2632 And farwell friends, thus Thisbie ends;
11 2633 Adieu, adieu, adieu
11 2634 
11 2635    Duk. Moone-shine & Lion are left to burie the dead
11 2636 
11 2637    Deme. I, and Wall too
11 2638 
11 2639    Bot. No, I assure you, the wall is downe, that parted
11 2640 their Fathers. Will it please you to see the Epilogue, or
11 2641 to heare a Bergomask dance, betweene two of our company?
11 2642   Duk. No Epilogue, I pray you; for your play needs
11 2643 no excuse. Neuer excuse; for when the plaiers are all
11 2644 dead, there need none to be blamed. Marry, if hee that
11 2645 writ it had plaid Piramus, and hung himselfe in Thisbies
11 2646 garter, it would haue beene a fine Tragedy: and so it is
11 2647 truely, and very notably discharg'd. but come, your
11 2648 Burgomaske; let your Epilogue alone.
11 2649 The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelue.
11 2650 Louers to bed, 'tis almost Fairy time.
11 2651 I feare we shall out-sleepe the comming morne,
11 2652 As much as we this night haue ouer-watcht.
11 2653 This palpable grosse play hath well beguil'd
11 2654 The heauy gate of night. Sweet friends to bed.
11 2655 A fortnight hold we this solemnity.
11 2656 In nightly Reuels; and new iollitie.
11 2657 
11 2658 Exeunt.
11 2659 
11 2660 Enter Pucke.
11 2661 
11 2662   Puck. Now the hungry Lyons rores,
11 2663 And the Wolfe beholds the Moone:
11 2664 Whilest the heauy ploughman snores,
11 2665 All with weary taske fore-done.
11 2666 Now the wasted brands doe glow,
11 2667 Whil'st the scritch-owle, scritching loud,
11 2668 Puts the wretch that lies in woe,
11 2669 In remembrance of a shrowd.
11 2670 Now it is the time of night,
11 2671 That the graues, all gaping wide,
11 2672 Euery one lets forth his spright,
11 2673 In the Church-way paths to glide,
11 2674 And we Fairies, that do runne,
11 2675 By the triple Hecates teame,
11 2676 From the presence of the Sunne,
11 2677 Following darkenesse like a dreame,
11 2678 Now are frollicke; not a Mouse
11 2679 Shall disturbe this hallowed house.
11 2680 I am sent with broome before,
11 2681 To sweep the dust behinde the doore.
11 2682 Enter King and Queene of Fairies, with their traine.
11 2683 
11 2684   Ob. Through the house giue glimmering light,
11 2685 By the dead and drowsie fier,
11 2686 Euerie Elfe and Fairie spright,
11 2687 Hop as light as bird from brier,
11 2688 And this Ditty after me, sing and dance it trippinglie,
11 2689   Tita. First rehearse this song by roate,
11 2690 To each word a warbling note.
11 2691 Hand in hand, with Fairie grace,
11 2692 Will we sing and blesse this place.
11 2693 
11 2694 The Song.
11 2695 
11 2696 Now vntill the breake of day,
11 2697 Through this house each Fairy stray.
11 2698 To the best Bride-bed will we,
11 2699 Which by vs shall blessed be:
11 2700 And the issue there create,
11 2701 Euer shall be fortunate:
11 2702 So shall all the couples three,
11 2703 Euer true in louing be:
11 2704 And the blots of Natures hand,
11 2705 Shall not in their issue stand.
11 2706 Neuer mole, harelip, nor scarre,
11 2707 nor mark prodigious, such as are
11 2708 Despised in Natiuitie,
11 2709 Shall vpon their children be.
11 2710 With this field dew consecrate,
11 2711 Euery Fairy take his gate,
11 2712 And each seuerall chamber blesse,
11 2713 Through this Pallace with sweet peace,
11 2714 Euer shall in safety rest.
11 2715 And the owner of it blest.
11 2716 Trip away, make no stay;
11 2717 Meet me all by breake of day
11 2718 
11 2719    Robin. If we shadowes haue offended,
11 2720 Thinke but this (and all is mended)
11 2721 That you haue but slumbred heere,
11 2722 While these Visions did appeare.
11 2723 And this weake and idle theame,
11 2724 No more yeelding but a dreame,
11 2725 Gentles, doe not reprehend.
11 2726 If you pardon, we will mend.
11 2727 And as I am an honest Pucke,
11 2728 If we haue vnearned lucke,
11 2729 Now to scape the Serpents tongue,
11 2730 We will make amends ere long:
11 2731 Else the Pucke a lyar call.
11 2732 So good night vnto you all.
11 2733 Giue me your hands, if we be friends,
11 2734 And Robin shall restore amends.
11 2735 
11 2736 FINIS. A MIDSOMMER Nights Dreame.
