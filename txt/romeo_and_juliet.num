15 70 
15 71                         Enter Chorus.
15 72 
15 73 
15 74   Chor. Two households, both alike in dignity,
15 75     In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
15 76     From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
15 77     Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
15 78     From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
15 79     A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
15 80     Whose misadventur'd piteous overthrows
15 81     Doth with their death bury their parents' strife.
15 82     The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
15 83     And the continuance of their parents' rage,
15 84     Which, but their children's end, naught could remove,
15 85     Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
15 86     The which if you with patient ears attend,
15 87     What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
15 88                                                          [Exit.]

15 92 
15 93 ACT I. Scene I.
15 94 Verona. A public place.
15 95 
15 96 Enter Sampson and Gregory (with swords and bucklers) of the house
15 97 of Capulet.
15 98 
15 99 
15 100   Samp. Gregory, on my word, we'll not carry coals.
15 101 
15 102   Greg. No, for then we should be colliers.
15 103 
15 104   Samp. I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
15 105 
15 106   Greg. Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of collar.
15 107 
15 108   Samp. I strike quickly, being moved.
15 109 
15 110   Greg. But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
15 111 
15 112   Samp. A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
15 113 
15 114   Greg. To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand.
15 115     Therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.
15 116 
15 117   Samp. A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take
15 118     the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
15 119 
15 120   Greg. That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the
15 121     wall.
15 122 
15 123   Samp. 'Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
15 124     are ever thrust to the wall. Therefore I will push Montague's men
15 125     from the wall and thrust his maids to the wall.
15 126 
15 127   Greg. The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
15 128 
15 129   Samp. 'Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant. When I have
15 130     fought with the men, I will be cruel with the maids- I will cut off
15 131     their heads.
15 132 
15 133   Greg. The heads of the maids?
15 134 
15 135   Samp. Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.
15 136     Take it in what sense thou wilt.
15 137 
15 138   Greg. They must take it in sense that feel it.
15 139 
15 140   Samp. Me they shall feel while I am able to stand; and 'tis known I
15 141     am a pretty piece of flesh.
15 142 
15 143   Greg. 'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst
15 144     been poor-John. Draw thy tool! Here comes two of the house of
15 145     Montagues.
15 146 
15 147            Enter two other Servingmen [Abram and Balthasar].
15 148 
15 149 
15 150   Samp. My naked weapon is out. Quarrel! I will back thee.
15 151 
15 152   Greg. How? turn thy back and run?
15 153 
15 154   Samp. Fear me not.
15 155 
15 156   Greg. No, marry. I fear thee!
15 157 
15 158   Samp. Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
15 159 
15 160   Greg. I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.
15 161 
15 162   Samp. Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which is
15 163     disgrace to them, if they bear it.
15 164 
15 165   Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
15 166 
15 167   Samp. I do bite my thumb, sir.
15 168 
15 169   Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
15 170 
15 171   Samp. [aside to Gregory] Is the law of our side if I say ay?
15 172 
15 173   Greg. [aside to Sampson] No.
15 174 
15 175   Samp. No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my
15 176     thumb, sir.
15 177 
15 178   Greg. Do you quarrel, sir?
15 179 
15 180   Abr. Quarrel, sir? No, sir.
15 181 
15 182   Samp. But if you do, sir, am for you. I serve as good a man as
15 183     you.
15 184 
15 185   Abr. No better.
15 186 
15 187   Samp. Well, sir.
15 188 
15 189                         Enter Benvolio.
15 190 
15 191 
15 192   Greg. [aside to Sampson] Say 'better.' Here comes one of my
15 193     master's kinsmen.
15 194 
15 195   Samp. Yes, better, sir.
15 196 
15 197   Abr. You lie.
15 198 
15 199   Samp. Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
15 200                                                      They fight.
15 201 
15 202   Ben. Part, fools! [Beats down their swords.]
15 203     Put up your swords. You know not what you do.
15 204 
15 205                           Enter Tybalt.
15 206 
15 207 
15 208   Tyb. What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
15 209     Turn thee Benvolio! look upon thy death.
15 210 
15 211   Ben. I do but keep the peace. Put up thy sword,
15 212     Or manage it to part these men with me.
15 213 
15 214   Tyb. What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word
15 215     As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.
15 216     Have at thee, coward!                            They fight.
15 217 
15 218      Enter an officer, and three or four Citizens with clubs or
15 219                           partisans.
15 220 
15 221 
15 222   Officer. Clubs, bills, and partisans! Strike! beat them down!
15 223 
15 224   Citizens. Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!
15 225 
15 226            Enter Old Capulet in his gown, and his Wife.
15 227 
15 228 
15 229   Cap. What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!
15 230 
15 231   Wife. A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?
15 232 
15 233   Cap. My sword, I say! Old Montague is come
15 234     And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
15 235 
15 236                  Enter Old Montague and his Wife.
15 237 
15 238 
15 239   Mon. Thou villain Capulet!- Hold me not, let me go.
15 240 
15 241   M. Wife. Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.
15 242 
15 243                 Enter Prince Escalus, with his Train.
15 244 
15 245 
15 246   Prince. Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
15 247     Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel-
15 248     Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
15 249     That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
15 250     With purple fountains issuing from your veins!
15 251     On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
15 252     Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground
15 253     And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
15 254     Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word
15 255     By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
15 256     Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets
15 257     And made Verona's ancient citizens
15 258     Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments
15 259     To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
15 260     Cank'red with peace, to part your cank'red hate.
15 261     If ever you disturb our streets again,
15 262     Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
15 263     For this time all the rest depart away.
15 264     You, Capulet, shall go along with me;
15 265     And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
15 266     To know our farther pleasure in this case,
15 267     To old Freetown, our common judgment place.
15 268     Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
15 269               Exeunt [all but Montague, his Wife, and Benvolio].
15 270 
15 271   Mon. Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
15 272     Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
15 273 
15 274   Ben. Here were the servants of your adversary
15 275     And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.
15 276     I drew to part them. In the instant came
15 277     The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar'd;
15 278     Which, as he breath'd defiance to my ears,
15 279     He swung about his head and cut the winds,
15 280     Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss'd him in scorn.
15 281     While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
15 282     Came more and more, and fought on part and part,
15 283     Till the Prince came, who parted either part.
15 284 
15 285   M. Wife. O, where is Romeo? Saw you him to-day?
15 286     Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
15 287 
15 288   Ben. Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
15 289     Peer'd forth the golden window of the East,
15 290     A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
15 291     Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
15 292     That westward rooteth from the city's side,
15 293     So early walking did I see your son.
15 294     Towards him I made; but he was ware of me
15 295     And stole into the covert of the wood.
15 296     I- measuring his affections by my own,
15 297     Which then most sought where most might not be found,
15 298     Being one too many by my weary self-
15 299     Pursu'd my humour, not Pursuing his,
15 300     And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
15 301 
15 302   Mon. Many a morning hath he there been seen,
15 303     With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew,
15 304     Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
15 305     But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
15 306     Should in the furthest East bean to draw
15 307     The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
15 308     Away from light steals home my heavy son
15 309     And private in his chamber pens himself,
15 310     Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight
15 311     And makes himself an artificial night.
15 312     Black and portentous must this humour prove
15 313     Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
15 314 
15 315   Ben. My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
15 316 
15 317   Mon. I neither know it nor can learn of him
15 318 
15 319   Ben. Have you importun'd him by any means?
15 320 
15 321   Mon. Both by myself and many other friend;
15 322     But he, his own affections' counsellor,
15 323     Is to himself- I will not say how true-
15 324     But to himself so secret and so close,
15 325     So far from sounding and discovery,
15 326     As is the bud bit with an envious worm
15 327     Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air
15 328     Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
15 329     Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,
15 330     We would as willingly give cure as know.
15 331 
15 332                        Enter Romeo.
15 333 
15 334 
15 335   Ben. See, where he comes. So please you step aside,
15 336     I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
15 337 
15 338   Mon. I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
15 339     To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away,
15 340                                      Exeunt [Montague and Wife].
15 341 
15 342   Ben. Good morrow, cousin.
15 343 
15 344   Rom. Is the day so young?
15 345 
15 346   Ben. But new struck nine.
15 347 
15 348   Rom. Ay me! sad hours seem long.
15 349     Was that my father that went hence so fast?
15 350 
15 351   Ben. It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
15 352 
15 353   Rom. Not having that which having makes them short.
15 354 
15 355   Ben. In love?
15 356 
15 357   Rom. Out-
15 358 
15 359   Ben. Of love?
15 360 
15 361   Rom. Out of her favour where I am in love.
15 362 
15 363   Ben. Alas that love, so gentle in his view,
15 364     Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
15 365 
15 366   Rom. Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,
15 367     Should without eyes see pathways to his will!
15 368     Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
15 369     Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
15 370     Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
15 371     Why then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
15 372     O anything, of nothing first create!
15 373     O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
15 374     Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
15 375     Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!
15 376     Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is
15 377     This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
15 378     Dost thou not laugh?
15 379 
15 380   Ben. No, coz, I rather weep.
15 381 
15 382   Rom. Good heart, at what?
15 383 
15 384   Ben. At thy good heart's oppression.
15 385 
15 386   Rom. Why, such is love's transgression.
15 387     Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
15 388     Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
15 389     With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown
15 390     Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
15 391     Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs;
15 392     Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
15 393     Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears.
15 394     What is it else? A madness most discreet,
15 395     A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.
15 396     Farewell, my coz.
15 397 
15 398   Ben. Soft! I will go along.
15 399     An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
15 400 
15 401   Rom. Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here:
15 402     This is not Romeo, he's some other where.
15 403 
15 404   Ben. Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?
15 405 
15 406   Rom. What, shall I groan and tell thee?
15 407 
15 408   Ben. Groan? Why, no;
15 409     But sadly tell me who.
15 410 
15 411   Rom. Bid a sick man in sadness make his will.
15 412     Ah, word ill urg'd to one that is so ill!
15 413     In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
15 414 
15 415   Ben. I aim'd so near when I suppos'd you lov'd.
15 416 
15 417   Rom. A right good markman! And she's fair I love.
15 418 
15 419   Ben. A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
15 420 
15 421   Rom. Well, in that hit you miss. She'll not be hit
15 422     With Cupid's arrow. She hath Dian's wit,
15 423     And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
15 424     From Love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
15 425     She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
15 426     Nor bide th' encounter of assailing eyes,
15 427     Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.
15 428     O, she's rich in beauty; only poor
15 429     That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.
15 430 
15 431   Ben. Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
15 432 
15 433   Rom. She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;
15 434     For beauty, starv'd with her severity,
15 435     Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
15 436     She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
15 437     To merit bliss by making me despair.
15 438     She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
15 439     Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
15 440 
15 441   Ben. Be rul'd by me: forget to think of her.
15 442 
15 443   Rom. O, teach me how I should forget to think!
15 444 
15 445   Ben. By giving liberty unto thine eyes.
15 446     Examine other beauties.
15 447 
15 448   Rom. 'Tis the way
15 449     To call hers (exquisite) in question more.
15 450     These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows,
15 451     Being black puts us in mind they hide the fair.
15 452     He that is strucken blind cannot forget
15 453     The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.
15 454     Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
15 455     What doth her beauty serve but as a note
15 456     Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
15 457     Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget.
15 458 
15 459   Ben. I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.      Exeunt.
15 460 
15 461

15 464 Scene II.
15 465 A Street.
15 466 
15 467 Enter Capulet, County Paris, and [Servant] -the Clown.
15 468 
15 469 
15 470   Cap. But Montague is bound as well as I,
15 471     In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
15 472     For men so old as we to keep the peace.
15 473 
15 474   Par. Of honourable reckoning are you both,
15 475     And pity 'tis you liv'd at odds so long.
15 476     But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
15 477 
15 478   Cap. But saying o'er what I have said before:
15 479     My child is yet a stranger in the world,
15 480     She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;
15 481     Let two more summers wither in their pride
15 482     Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
15 483 
15 484   Par. Younger than she are happy mothers made.
15 485 
15 486   Cap. And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
15 487     The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she;
15 488     She is the hopeful lady of my earth.
15 489     But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart;
15 490     My will to her consent is but a part.
15 491     An she agree, within her scope of choice
15 492     Lies my consent and fair according voice.
15 493     This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
15 494     Whereto I have invited many a guest,
15 495     Such as I love; and you among the store,
15 496     One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
15 497     At my poor house look to behold this night
15 498     Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light.
15 499     Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
15 500     When well apparell'd April on the heel
15 501     Of limping Winter treads, even such delight
15 502     Among fresh female buds shall you this night
15 503     Inherit at my house. Hear all, all see,
15 504     And like her most whose merit most shall be;
15 505     Which, on more view of many, mine, being one,
15 506     May stand in number, though in reck'ning none.
15 507     Come, go with me. [To Servant, giving him a paper] Go,
15 508     sirrah, trudge about
15 509     Through fair Verona; find those persons out
15 510     Whose names are written there, and to them say,
15 511     My house and welcome on their pleasure stay-
15 512                                      Exeunt [Capulet and Paris].
15 513 
15 514   Serv. Find them out whose names are written here? It is written
15 515     that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor
15 516     with his last, the fisher with his pencil and the painter
15 517     with his nets; but I am sent to find those persons whose names are
15 518     here writ, and can never find what names the writing person
15 519     hath here writ. I must to the learned. In good time!
15 520 
15 521                    Enter Benvolio and Romeo.
15 522 
15 523 
15 524   Ben. Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning;
15 525     One pain is lessoned by another's anguish;
15 526     Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
15 527     One desperate grief cures with another's languish.
15 528     Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
15 529     And the rank poison of the old will die.
15 530 
15 531   Rom. Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.
15 532 
15 533   Ben. For what, I pray thee?
15 534 
15 535   Rom. For your broken shin.
15 536 
15 537   Ben. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
15 538 
15 539   Rom. Not mad, but bound more than a madman is;
15 540     Shut up in Prison, kept without my food,
15 541     Whipp'd and tormented and- God-den, good fellow.
15 542 
15 543   Serv. God gi' go-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
15 544 
15 545   Rom. Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
15 546 
15 547   Serv. Perhaps you have learned it without book. But I pray, can
15 548     you read anything you see?
15 549 
15 550   Rom. Ay, If I know the letters and the language.
15 551 
15 552   Serv. Ye say honestly. Rest you merry!
15 553 
15 554   Rom. Stay, fellow; I can read.                       He reads.
15 555 
15 556       'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
15 557       County Anselmo and his beauteous sisters;
15 558       The lady widow of Vitruvio;
15 559       Signior Placentio and His lovely nieces;
15 560       Mercutio and his brother Valentine;
15 561       Mine uncle Capulet, his wife, and daughters;
15 562       My fair niece Rosaline and Livia;
15 563       Signior Valentio and His cousin Tybalt;
15 564       Lucio and the lively Helena.'
15 565 
15 566     [Gives back the paper.] A fair assembly. Whither should they
15 567     come?
15 568 
15 569   Serv. Up.
15 570 
15 571   Rom. Whither?
15 572 
15 573   Serv. To supper, to our house.
15 574 
15 575   Rom. Whose house?
15 576 
15 577   Serv. My master's.
15 578 
15 579   Rom. Indeed I should have ask'd you that before.
15 580 
15 581   Serv. Now I'll tell you without asking. My master is the great
15 582     rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray
15 583     come and crush a cup of wine. Rest you merry!               Exit.
15 584 
15 585   Ben. At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
15 586     Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov'st;
15 587     With all the admired beauties of Verona.
15 588     Go thither, and with unattainted eye
15 589     Compare her face with some that I shall show,
15 590     And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
15 591 
15 592   Rom. When the devout religion of mine eye
15 593     Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
15 594     And these, who, often drown'd, could never die,
15 595     Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
15 596     One fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun
15 597     Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.
15 598 
15 599   Ben. Tut! you saw her fair, none else being by,
15 600     Herself pois'd with herself in either eye;
15 601     But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
15 602     Your lady's love against some other maid
15 603     That I will show you shining at this feast,
15 604     And she shall scant show well that now seems best.
15 605 
15 606   Rom. I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
15 607     But to rejoice in splendour of my own.              [Exeunt.]
15 608 
15 609

15 611 
15 612 Scene III.
15 613 Capulet's house.
15 614 
15 615 Enter Capulet's Wife, and Nurse.
15 616 
15 617 
15 618   Wife. Nurse, where's my daughter? Call her forth to me.
15 619 
15 620   Nurse. Now, by my maidenhead at twelve year old,
15 621     I bade her come. What, lamb! what ladybird!
15 622     God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!
15 623 
15 624                          Enter Juliet.
15 625 
15 626 
15 627   Jul. How now? Who calls?
15 628 
15 629   Nurse. Your mother.
15 630 
15 631   Jul. Madam, I am here.
15 632     What is your will?
15 633 
15 634   Wife. This is the matter- Nurse, give leave awhile,
15 635     We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again;
15 636     I have rememb'red me, thou's hear our counsel.
15 637     Thou knowest my daughter's of a pretty age.
15 638 
15 639   Nurse. Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
15 640 
15 641   Wife. She's not fourteen.
15 642 
15 643   Nurse. I'll lay fourteen of my teeth-
15 644     And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four-
15 645     She is not fourteen. How long is it now
15 646     To Lammastide?
15 647 
15 648   Wife. A fortnight and odd days.
15 649 
15 650   Nurse. Even or odd, of all days in the year,
15 651     Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.
15 652     Susan and she (God rest all Christian souls!)
15 653     Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God;
15 654     She was too good for me. But, as I said,
15 655     On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;
15 656     That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
15 657     'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
15 658     And she was wean'd (I never shall forget it),
15 659     Of all the days of the year, upon that day;
15 660     For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
15 661     Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall.
15 662     My lord and you were then at Mantua.
15 663     Nay, I do bear a brain. But, as I said,
15 664     When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
15 665     Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
15 666     To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
15 667     Shake, quoth the dovehouse! 'Twas no need, I trow,
15 668     To bid me trudge.
15 669     And since that time it is eleven years,
15 670     For then she could stand high-lone; nay, by th' rood,
15 671     She could have run and waddled all about;
15 672     For even the day before, she broke her brow;
15 673     And then my husband (God be with his soul!
15 674     'A was a merry man) took up the child.
15 675     'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
15 676     Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
15 677     Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidam,
15 678     The pretty wretch left crying, and said 'Ay.'
15 679     To see now how a jest shall come about!
15 680     I warrant, an I should live a thousand yeas,
15 681     I never should forget it. 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he,
15 682     And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said 'Ay.'
15 683 
15 684   Wife. Enough of this. I pray thee hold thy peace.
15 685 
15 686   Nurse. Yes, madam. Yet I cannot choose but laugh
15 687     To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
15 688     And yet, I warrant, it bad upon it brow
15 689     A bump as big as a young cock'rel's stone;
15 690     A perilous knock; and it cried bitterly.
15 691     'Yea,' quoth my husband, 'fall'st upon thy face?
15 692     Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
15 693     Wilt thou not, Jule?' It stinted, and said 'Ay.'
15 694 
15 695   Jul. And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.
15 696 
15 697   Nurse. Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
15 698     Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nurs'd.
15 699     An I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.
15 700 
15 701   Wife. Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
15 702     I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
15 703     How stands your disposition to be married?
15 704 
15 705   Jul. It is an honour that I dream not of.
15 706 
15 707   Nurse. An honour? Were not I thine only nurse,
15 708     I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.
15 709 
15 710   Wife. Well, think of marriage now. Younger than you,
15 711     Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
15 712     Are made already mothers. By my count,
15 713     I was your mother much upon these years
15 714     That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
15 715     The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
15 716 
15 717   Nurse. A man, young lady! lady, such a man
15 718     As all the world- why he's a man of wax.
15 719 
15 720   Wife. Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
15 721 
15 722   Nurse. Nay, he's a flower, in faith- a very flower.
15 723 
15 724   Wife. What say you? Can you love the gentleman?
15 725     This night you shall behold him at our feast.
15 726     Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
15 727     And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
15 728     Examine every married lineament,
15 729     And see how one another lends content;
15 730     And what obscur'd in this fair volume lies
15 731     Find written in the margent of his eyes,
15 732     This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
15 733     To beautify him only lacks a cover.
15 734     The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
15 735     For fair without the fair within to hide.
15 736     That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
15 737     That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
15 738     So shall you share all that he doth possess,
15 739     By having him making yourself no less.
15 740 
15 741   Nurse. No less? Nay, bigger! Women grow by men
15 742 
15 743   Wife. Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
15 744 
15 745   Jul. I'll look to like, if looking liking move;
15 746     But no more deep will I endart mine eye
15 747     Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
15 748 
15 749                         Enter Servingman.
15 750 
15 751 
15 752   Serv. Madam, the guests are come, supper serv'd up, you call'd,
15 753     my young lady ask'd for, the nurse curs'd in the pantry, and
15 754     everything in extremity. I must hence to wait. I beseech you
15 755     follow straight.
15 756 
15 757   Wife. We follow thee.                       Exit [Servingman].
15 758     Juliet, the County stays.
15 759 
15 760   Nurse. Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
15 761                                                          Exeunt.

15 764 
15 765 
15 766 Scene IV.
15 767 A street.
15 768 
15 769 Enter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six other Maskers;
15 770 Torchbearers.
15 771 
15 772 
15 773   Rom. What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
15 774     Or shall we on without apology?
15 775 
15 776   Ben. The date is out of such prolixity.
15 777     We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
15 778     Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
15 779     Scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper;
15 780     Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
15 781     After the prompter, for our entrance;
15 782     But, let them measure us by what they will,
15 783     We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.
15 784 
15 785   Rom. Give me a torch. I am not for this ambling.
15 786     Being but heavy, I will bear the light.
15 787 
15 788   Mer. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
15 789 
15 790   Rom. Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes
15 791     With nimble soles; I have a soul of lead
15 792     So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
15 793 
15 794   Mer. You are a lover. Borrow Cupid's wings
15 795     And soar with them above a common bound.
15 796 
15 797   Rom. I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
15 798     To soar with his light feathers; and so bound
15 799     I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.
15 800     Under love's heavy burthen do I sink.
15 801 
15 802   Mer. And, to sink in it, should you burthen love-
15 803     Too great oppression for a tender thing.
15 804 
15 805   Rom. Is love a tender thing? It is too rough,
15 806     Too rude, too boist'rous, and it pricks like thorn.
15 807 
15 808   Mer. If love be rough with you, be rough with love.
15 809     Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
15 810     Give me a case to put my visage in.
15 811     A visor for a visor! What care I
15 812     What curious eye doth quote deformities?
15 813     Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.
15 814 
15 815   Ben. Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in
15 816     But every man betake him to his legs.
15 817 
15 818   Rom. A torch for me! Let wantons light of heart
15 819     Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels;
15 820     For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase,
15 821     I'll be a candle-holder and look on;
15 822     The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.
15 823 
15 824   Mer. Tut! dun's the mouse, the constable's own word!
15 825     If thou art Dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
15 826     Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
15 827     Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!
15 828 
15 829   Rom. Nay, that's not so.
15 830 
15 831   Mer. I mean, sir, in delay
15 832     We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
15 833     Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
15 834     Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
15 835 
15 836   Rom. And we mean well, in going to this masque;
15 837     But 'tis no wit to go.
15 838 
15 839   Mer. Why, may one ask?
15 840 
15 841   Rom. I dreamt a dream to-night.
15 842 
15 843   Mer. And so did I.
15 844 
15 845   Rom. Well, what was yours?
15 846 
15 847   Mer. That dreamers often lie.
15 848 
15 849   Rom. In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
15 850 
15 851   Mer. O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
15 852     She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
15 853     In shape no bigger than an agate stone
15 854     On the forefinger of an alderman,
15 855     Drawn with a team of little atomies
15 856     Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
15 857     Her wagon spokes made of long spinners' legs,
15 858     The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;
15 859     Her traces, of the smallest spider's web;
15 860     Her collars, of the moonshine's wat'ry beams;
15 861     Her whip, of cricket's bone; the lash, of film;
15 862     Her wagoner, a small grey-coated gnat,
15 863     Not half so big as a round little worm
15 864     Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
15 865     Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,
15 866     Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
15 867     Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
15 868     And in this state she 'gallops night by night
15 869     Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
15 870     O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on cursies straight;
15 871     O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;
15 872     O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
15 873     Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
15 874     Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.
15 875     Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
15 876     And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
15 877     And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
15 878     Tickling a parson's nose as 'a lies asleep,
15 879     Then dreams he of another benefice.
15 880     Sometimes she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
15 881     And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
15 882     Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
15 883     Of healths five fadom deep; and then anon
15 884     Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
15 885     And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two
15 886     And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
15 887     That plats the manes of horses in the night
15 888     And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish, hairs,
15 889     Which once untangled much misfortune bodes
15 890     This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
15 891     That presses them and learns them first to bear,
15 892     Making them women of good carriage.
15 893     This is she-
15 894 
15 895   Rom. Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
15 896     Thou talk'st of nothing.
15 897 
15 898   Mer. True, I talk of dreams;
15 899     Which are the children of an idle brain,
15 900     Begot of nothing but vain fantasy;
15 901     Which is as thin of substance as the air,
15 902     And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
15 903     Even now the frozen bosom of the North
15 904     And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
15 905     Turning his face to the dew-dropping South.
15 906 
15 907   Ben. This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves.
15 908     Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
15 909 
15 910   Rom. I fear, too early; for my mind misgives
15 911     Some consequence, yet hanging in the stars,
15 912     Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
15 913     With this night's revels and expire the term
15 914     Of a despised life, clos'd in my breast,
15 915     By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
15 916     But he that hath the steerage of my course
15 917     Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen!
15 918 
15 919   Ben. Strike, drum.
15 920                            They march about the stage. [Exeunt.]
15 921

15 925 Scene V.
15 926 Capulet's house.
15 927 
15 928 Servingmen come forth with napkins.
15 929 
15 930   1. Serv. Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away?
15 931     He shift a trencher! he scrape a trencher!
15 932   2. Serv. When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's
15 933     hands, and they unwash'd too, 'tis a foul thing.
15 934   1. Serv. Away with the join-stools, remove the court-cubbert,
15 935     look to the plate. Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane and, as
15 936     thou loves me, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and
15 937 Nell.
15 938     Anthony, and Potpan!
15 939   2. Serv. Ay, boy, ready.
15 940   1. Serv. You are look'd for and call'd for, ask'd for and
15 941     sought for, in the great chamber.
15 942   3. Serv. We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys!
15 943     Be brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.      Exeunt.
15 944 
15 945     Enter the Maskers, Enter, [with Servants,] Capulet, his Wife,
15 946               Juliet, Tybalt, and all the Guests
15 947                and Gentlewomen to the Maskers.
15 948 
15 949 
15 950   Cap. Welcome, gentlemen! Ladies that have their toes
15 951     Unplagu'd with corns will have a bout with you.
15 952     Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
15 953     Will now deny to dance? She that makes dainty,
15 954     She I'll swear hath corns. Am I come near ye now?
15 955     Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
15 956     That I have worn a visor and could tell
15 957     A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
15 958     Such as would please. 'Tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone!
15 959     You are welcome, gentlemen! Come, musicians, play.
15 960     A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
15 961                                     Music plays, and they dance.
15 962     More light, you knaves! and turn the tables up,
15 963     And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
15 964     Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
15 965     Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet,
15 966     For you and I are past our dancing days.
15 967     How long is't now since last yourself and I
15 968     Were in a mask?
15 969   2. Cap. By'r Lady, thirty years.
15 970 
15 971   Cap. What, man? 'Tis not so much, 'tis not so much!
15 972     'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,
15 973     Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,
15 974     Some five-and-twenty years, and then we mask'd.
15 975   2. Cap. 'Tis more, 'tis more! His son is elder, sir;
15 976     His son is thirty.
15 977 
15 978   Cap. Will you tell me that?
15 979     His son was but a ward two years ago.
15 980 
15 981   Rom. [to a Servingman] What lady's that, which doth enrich the
15 982     hand Of yonder knight?
15 983 
15 984   Serv. I know not, sir.
15 985 
15 986   Rom. O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
15 987     It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
15 988     Like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear-
15 989     Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
15 990     So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows
15 991     As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
15 992     The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand
15 993     And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
15 994     Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight!
15 995     For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
15 996 
15 997   Tyb. This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
15 998     Fetch me my rapier, boy. What, dares the slave
15 999     Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
15 1000     To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
15 1001     Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
15 1002     To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.
15 1003 
15 1004   Cap. Why, how now, kinsman? Wherefore storm you so?
15 1005 
15 1006   Tyb. Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe;
15 1007     A villain, that is hither come in spite
15 1008     To scorn at our solemnity this night.
15 1009 
15 1010   Cap. Young Romeo is it?
15 1011 
15 1012   Tyb. 'Tis he, that villain Romeo.
15 1013 
15 1014   Cap. Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone.
15 1015     'A bears him like a portly gentleman,
15 1016     And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
15 1017     To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth.
15 1018     I would not for the wealth of all this town
15 1019     Here in my house do him disparagement.
15 1020     Therefore be patient, take no note of him.
15 1021     It is my will; the which if thou respect,
15 1022     Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
15 1023     An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
15 1024 
15 1025   Tyb. It fits when such a villain is a guest.
15 1026     I'll not endure him.
15 1027 
15 1028   Cap. He shall be endur'd.
15 1029     What, goodman boy? I say he shall. Go to!
15 1030     Am I the master here, or you? Go to!
15 1031     You'll not endure him? God shall mend my soul!
15 1032     You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
15 1033     You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!
15 1034 
15 1035   Tyb. Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.
15 1036 
15 1037   Cap. Go to, go to!
15 1038     You are a saucy boy. Is't so, indeed?
15 1039     This trick may chance to scathe you. I know what.
15 1040     You must contrary me! Marry, 'tis time.-
15 1041     Well said, my hearts!- You are a princox- go!
15 1042     Be quiet, or- More light, more light!- For shame!
15 1043     I'll make you quiet; what!- Cheerly, my hearts!
15 1044 
15 1045   Tyb. Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
15 1046     Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
15 1047     I will withdraw; but this intrusion shall,
15 1048     Now seeming sweet, convert to bitt'rest gall.          Exit.
15 1049 
15 1050   Rom. If I profane with my unworthiest hand
15 1051     This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
15 1052     My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
15 1053     To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
15 1054 
15 1055   Jul. Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
15 1056     Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
15 1057     For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
15 1058     And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
15 1059 
15 1060   Rom. Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
15 1061 
15 1062   Jul. Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in pray'r.
15 1063 
15 1064   Rom. O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do!
15 1065     They pray; grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
15 1066 
15 1067   Jul. Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
15 1068 
15 1069   Rom. Then move not while my prayer's effect I take.
15 1070     Thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purg'd.  [Kisses her.]
15 1071 
15 1072   Jul. Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
15 1073 
15 1074   Rom. Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urg'd!
15 1075     Give me my sin again.                          [Kisses her.]
15 1076 
15 1077   Jul. You kiss by th' book.
15 1078 
15 1079   Nurse. Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
15 1080 
15 1081   Rom. What is her mother?
15 1082 
15 1083   Nurse. Marry, bachelor,
15 1084     Her mother is the lady of the house.
15 1085     And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous.
15 1086     I nurs'd her daughter that you talk'd withal.
15 1087     I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
15 1088     Shall have the chinks.
15 1089 
15 1090   Rom. Is she a Capulet?
15 1091     O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.
15 1092 
15 1093   Ben. Away, be gone; the sport is at the best.
15 1094 
15 1095   Rom. Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
15 1096 
15 1097   Cap. Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
15 1098     We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
15 1099     Is it e'en so? Why then, I thank you all.
15 1100     I thank you, honest gentlemen. Good night.
15 1101     More torches here! [Exeunt Maskers.] Come on then, let's to bed.
15 1102     Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late;
15 1103     I'll to my rest.
15 1104                               Exeunt [all but Juliet and Nurse].
15 1105 
15 1106   Jul. Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?
15 1107 
15 1108   Nurse. The son and heir of old Tiberio.
15 1109 
15 1110   Jul. What's he that now is going out of door?
15 1111 
15 1112   Nurse. Marry, that, I think, be young Petruchio.
15 1113 
15 1114   Jul. What's he that follows there, that would not dance?
15 1115 
15 1116   Nurse. I know not.
15 1117 
15 1118   Jul. Go ask his name.- If he be married,
15 1119     My grave is like to be my wedding bed.
15 1120 
15 1121   Nurse. His name is Romeo, and a Montague,
15 1122     The only son of your great enemy.
15 1123 
15 1124   Jul. My only love, sprung from my only hate!
15 1125     Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
15 1126     Prodigious birth of love it is to me
15 1127     That I must love a loathed enemy.
15 1128 
15 1129   Nurse. What's this? what's this?
15 1130 
15 1131   Jul. A rhyme I learnt even now
15 1132     Of one I danc'd withal.
15 1133                                      One calls within, 'Juliet.'
15 1134 
15 1135   Nurse. Anon, anon!
15 1136     Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.        Exeunt.
15 1137 
15 1138

15 1140 
15 1141 PROLOGUE
15 1142 
15 1143 Enter Chorus.
15 1144 
15 1145 
15 1146   Chor. Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie,
15 1147     And young affection gapes to be his heir;
15 1148     That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
15 1149     With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
15 1150     Now Romeo is belov'd, and loves again,
15 1151     Alike bewitched by the charm of looks;
15 1152     But to his foe suppos'd he must complain,
15 1153     And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks.
15 1154     Being held a foe, he may not have access
15 1155     To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear,
15 1156     And she as much in love, her means much less
15 1157     To meet her new beloved anywhere;
15 1158     But passion lends them power, time means, to meet,
15 1159     Temp'ring extremities with extreme sweet.
15 1160 Exit.

15 1165 ACT II. Scene I.
15 1166 A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard.
15 1167 
15 1168 Enter Romeo alone.
15 1169 
15 1170 
15 1171   Rom. Can I go forward when my heart is here?
15 1172     Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.
15 1173                      [Climbs the wall and leaps down within it.]
15 1174 
15 1175                    Enter Benvolio with Mercutio.
15 1176 
15 1177 
15 1178   Ben. Romeo! my cousin Romeo! Romeo!
15 1179 
15 1180   Mer. He is wise,
15 1181     And, on my life, hath stol'n him home to bed.
15 1182 
15 1183   Ben. He ran this way, and leapt this orchard wall.
15 1184     Call, good Mercutio.
15 1185 
15 1186   Mer. Nay, I'll conjure too.
15 1187     Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
15 1188     Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh;
15 1189     Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied!
15 1190     Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove';
15 1191     Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
15 1192     One nickname for her purblind son and heir,
15 1193     Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim
15 1194     When King Cophetua lov'd the beggar maid!
15 1195     He heareth not, he stirreth not, be moveth not;
15 1196     The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
15 1197     I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes.
15 1198     By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
15 1199     By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,
15 1200     And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
15 1201     That in thy likeness thou appear to us!
15 1202 
15 1203   Ben. An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
15 1204 
15 1205   Mer. This cannot anger him. 'Twould anger him
15 1206     To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
15 1207     Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
15 1208     Till she had laid it and conjur'd it down.
15 1209     That were some spite; my invocation
15 1210     Is fair and honest: in his mistress' name,
15 1211     I conjure only but to raise up him.
15 1212 
15 1213   Ben. Come, he hath hid himself among these trees
15 1214     To be consorted with the humorous night.
15 1215     Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
15 1216 
15 1217   Mer. If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
15 1218     Now will he sit under a medlar tree
15 1219     And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
15 1220     As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.
15 1221     O, Romeo, that she were, O that she were
15 1222     An open et cetera, thou a pop'rin pear!
15 1223     Romeo, good night. I'll to my truckle-bed;
15 1224     This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
15 1225     Come, shall we go?
15 1226 
15 1227   Ben. Go then, for 'tis in vain
15 1228     'To seek him here that means not to be found.
15 1229                                                          Exeunt.

15 1234 Scene II.
15 1235 Capulet's orchard.
15 1236 
15 1237 Enter Romeo.
15 1238 
15 1239 
15 1240   Rom. He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
15 1241 
15 1242                      Enter Juliet above at a window.
15 1243 
15 1244     But soft! What light through yonder window breaks?
15 1245     It is the East, and Juliet is the sun!
15 1246     Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
15 1247     Who is already sick and pale with grief
15 1248     That thou her maid art far more fair than she.
15 1249     Be not her maid, since she is envious.
15 1250     Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
15 1251     And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off.
15 1252     It is my lady; O, it is my love!
15 1253     O that she knew she were!
15 1254     She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?
15 1255     Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
15 1256     I am too bold; 'tis not to me she speaks.
15 1257     Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
15 1258     Having some business, do entreat her eyes
15 1259     To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
15 1260     What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
15 1261     The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars
15 1262     As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
15 1263     Would through the airy region stream so bright
15 1264     That birds would sing and think it were not night.
15 1265     See how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
15 1266     O that I were a glove upon that hand,
15 1267     That I might touch that cheek!
15 1268 
15 1269   Jul. Ay me!
15 1270 
15 1271   Rom. She speaks.
15 1272     O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
15 1273     As glorious to this night, being o'er my head,
15 1274     As is a winged messenger of heaven
15 1275     Unto the white-upturned wond'ring eyes
15 1276     Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
15 1277     When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
15 1278     And sails upon the bosom of the air.
15 1279 
15 1280   Jul. O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
15 1281     Deny thy father and refuse thy name!
15 1282     Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
15 1283     And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
15 1284 
15 1285   Rom. [aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
15 1286 
15 1287   Jul. 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.
15 1288     Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
15 1289     What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
15 1290     Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
15 1291     Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
15 1292     What's in a name? That which we call a rose
15 1293     By any other name would smell as sweet.
15 1294     So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
15 1295     Retain that dear perfection which he owes
15 1296     Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name;
15 1297     And for that name, which is no part of thee,
15 1298     Take all myself.
15 1299 
15 1300   Rom. I take thee at thy word.
15 1301     Call me but love, and I'll be new baptiz'd;
15 1302     Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
15 1303 
15 1304   Jul. What man art thou that, thus bescreen'd in night,
15 1305     So stumblest on my counsel?
15 1306 
15 1307   Rom. By a name
15 1308     I know not how to tell thee who I am.
15 1309     My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
15 1310     Because it is an enemy to thee.
15 1311     Had I it written, I would tear the word.
15 1312 
15 1313   Jul. My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words
15 1314     Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound.
15 1315     Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?
15 1316 
15 1317   Rom. Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
15 1318 
15 1319   Jul. How cam'st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
15 1320     The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
15 1321     And the place death, considering who thou art,
15 1322     If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
15 1323 
15 1324   Rom. With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls;
15 1325     For stony limits cannot hold love out,
15 1326     And what love can do, that dares love attempt.
15 1327     Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
15 1328 
15 1329   Jul. If they do see thee, they will murther thee.
15 1330 
15 1331   Rom. Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
15 1332     Than twenty of their swords! Look thou but sweet,
15 1333     And I am proof against their enmity.
15 1334 
15 1335   Jul. I would not for the world they saw thee here.
15 1336 
15 1337   Rom. I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
15 1338     And but thou love me, let them find me here.
15 1339     My life were better ended by their hate
15 1340     Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
15 1341 
15 1342   Jul. By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
15 1343 
15 1344   Rom. By love, that first did prompt me to enquire.
15 1345     He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.
15 1346     I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
15 1347     As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
15 1348     I would adventure for such merchandise.
15 1349 
15 1350   Jul. Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face;
15 1351     Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
15 1352     For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night.
15 1353     Fain would I dwell on form- fain, fain deny
15 1354     What I have spoke; but farewell compliment!
15 1355     Dost thou love me, I know thou wilt say 'Ay';
15 1356     And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear'st,
15 1357     Thou mayst prove false. At lovers' perjuries,
15 1358     They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
15 1359     If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.
15 1360     Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,
15 1361     I'll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay,
15 1362     So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
15 1363     In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
15 1364     And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light;
15 1365     But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
15 1366     Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
15 1367     I should have been more strange, I must confess,
15 1368     But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
15 1369     My true-love passion. Therefore pardon me,
15 1370     And not impute this yielding to light love,
15 1371     Which the dark night hath so discovered.
15 1372 
15 1373   Rom. Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear,
15 1374     That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops-
15 1375 
15 1376   Jul. O, swear not by the moon, th' inconstant moon,
15 1377     That monthly changes in her circled orb,
15 1378     Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
15 1379 
15 1380   Rom. What shall I swear by?
15 1381 
15 1382   Jul. Do not swear at all;
15 1383     Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
15 1384     Which is the god of my idolatry,
15 1385     And I'll believe thee.
15 1386 
15 1387   Rom. If my heart's dear love-
15 1388 
15 1389   Jul. Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,
15 1390     I have no joy of this contract to-night.
15 1391     It is too rash, too unadvis'd, too sudden;
15 1392     Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
15 1393     Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
15 1394     This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
15 1395     May prove a beauteous flow'r when next we meet.
15 1396     Good night, good night! As sweet repose and rest
15 1397     Come to thy heart as that within my breast!
15 1398 
15 1399   Rom. O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
15 1400 
15 1401   Jul. What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
15 1402 
15 1403   Rom. Th' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
15 1404 
15 1405   Jul. I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;
15 1406     And yet I would it were to give again.
15 1407 
15 1408   Rom. Would'st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?
15 1409 
15 1410   Jul. But to be frank and give it thee again.
15 1411     And yet I wish but for the thing I have.
15 1412     My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
15 1413     My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
15 1414     The more I have, for both are infinite.
15 1415     I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu!
15 1416                                            [Nurse] calls within.
15 1417     Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
15 1418     Stay but a little, I will come again.                [Exit.]
15 1419 
15 1420   Rom. O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard,
15 1421     Being in night, all this is but a dream,
15 1422     Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.
15 1423 
15 1424                        Enter Juliet above.
15 1425 
15 1426 
15 1427   Jul. Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
15 1428     If that thy bent of love be honourable,
15 1429     Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
15 1430     By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
15 1431     Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
15 1432     And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
15 1433     And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
15 1434 
15 1435   Nurse. (within) Madam!
15 1436 
15 1437   Jul. I come, anon.- But if thou meanest not well,
15 1438     I do beseech thee-
15 1439 
15 1440   Nurse. (within) Madam!
15 1441 
15 1442   Jul. By-and-by I come.-
15 1443     To cease thy suit and leave me to my grief.
15 1444     To-morrow will I send.
15 1445 
15 1446   Rom. So thrive my soul-
15 1447 
15 1448   Jul. A thousand times good night!                        Exit.
15 1449 
15 1450   Rom. A thousand times the worse, to want thy light!
15 1451     Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books;
15 1452     But love from love, towards school with heavy looks.
15 1453 
15 1454                      Enter Juliet again, [above].
15 1455 
15 1456 
15 1457   Jul. Hist! Romeo, hist! O for a falconer's voice
15 1458     To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
15 1459     Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud;
15 1460     Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
15 1461     And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine
15 1462     With repetition of my Romeo's name.
15 1463     Romeo!
15 1464 
15 1465   Rom. It is my soul that calls upon my name.
15 1466     How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
15 1467     Like softest music to attending ears!
15 1468 
15 1469   Jul. Romeo!
15 1470 
15 1471   Rom. My dear?
15 1472 
15 1473   Jul. At what o'clock to-morrow
15 1474     Shall I send to thee?
15 1475 
15 1476   Rom. By the hour of nine.
15 1477 
15 1478   Jul. I will not fail. 'Tis twenty years till then.
15 1479     I have forgot why I did call thee back.
15 1480 
15 1481   Rom. Let me stand here till thou remember it.
15 1482 
15 1483   Jul. I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
15 1484     Rememb'ring how I love thy company.
15 1485 
15 1486   Rom. And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
15 1487     Forgetting any other home but this.
15 1488 
15 1489   Jul. 'Tis almost morning. I would have thee gone-
15 1490     And yet no farther than a wanton's bird,
15 1491     That lets it hop a little from her hand,
15 1492     Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
15 1493     And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
15 1494     So loving-jealous of his liberty.
15 1495 
15 1496   Rom. I would I were thy bird.
15 1497 
15 1498   Jul. Sweet, so would I.
15 1499     Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
15 1500     Good night, good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow,
15 1501     That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
15 1502                                                          [Exit.]
15 1503 
15 1504   Rom. Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
15 1505     Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
15 1506     Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
15 1507     His help to crave and my dear hap to tell.
15 1508  Exit
15 1509 
15 1510 
15 1511 
15 1512 
15 1513 Scene III.
15 1514 Friar Laurence's cell.
15 1515 
15 1516 Enter Friar, [Laurence] alone, with a basket.
15 1517 
15 1518 
15 1519   Friar. The grey-ey'd morn smiles on the frowning night,
15 1520     Check'ring the Eastern clouds with streaks of light;
15 1521     And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
15 1522     From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels.
15 1523     Non, ere the sun advance his burning eye
15 1524     The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
15 1525     I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
15 1526     With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
15 1527     The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb.
15 1528     What is her burying gave, that is her womb;
15 1529     And from her womb children of divers kind
15 1530     We sucking on her natural bosom find;
15 1531     Many for many virtues excellent,
15 1532     None but for some, and yet all different.
15 1533     O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
15 1534     In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities;
15 1535     For naught so vile that on the earth doth live
15 1536     But to the earth some special good doth give;
15 1537     Nor aught so good but, strain'd from that fair use,
15 1538     Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.
15 1539     Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied,
15 1540     And vice sometime's by action dignified.
15 1541     Within the infant rind of this small flower
15 1542     Poison hath residence, and medicine power;
15 1543     For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
15 1544     Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
15 1545     Two such opposed kings encamp them still
15 1546     In man as well as herbs- grace and rude will;
15 1547     And where the worser is predominant,
15 1548     Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
15 1549 
15 1550                         Enter Romeo.
15 1551 
15 1552 
15 1553   Rom. Good morrow, father.
15 1554 
15 1555   Friar. Benedicite!
15 1556     What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
15 1557     Young son, it argues a distempered head
15 1558     So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.
15 1559     Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
15 1560     And where care lodges sleep will never lie;
15 1561     But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
15 1562     Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.
15 1563     Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
15 1564     Thou art uprous'd with some distemp'rature;
15 1565     Or if not so, then here I hit it right-
15 1566     Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.
15 1567 
15 1568   Rom. That last is true-the sweeter rest was mine.
15 1569 
15 1570   Friar. God pardon sin! Wast thou with Rosaline?
15 1571 
15 1572   Rom. With Rosaline, my ghostly father? No.
15 1573     I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
15 1574 
15 1575   Friar. That's my good son! But where hast thou been then?
15 1576 
15 1577   Rom. I'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.
15 1578     I have been feasting with mine enemy,
15 1579     Where on a sudden one hath wounded me
15 1580     That's by me wounded. Both our remedies
15 1581     Within thy help and holy physic lies.
15 1582     I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
15 1583     My intercession likewise steads my foe.
15 1584 
15 1585   Friar. Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift
15 1586     Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
15 1587 
15 1588   Rom. Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
15 1589     On the fair daughter of rich Capulet;
15 1590     As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine,
15 1591     And all combin'd, save what thou must combine
15 1592     By holy marriage. When, and where, and how
15 1593     We met, we woo'd, and made exchange of vow,
15 1594     I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
15 1595     That thou consent to marry us to-day.
15 1596 
15 1597   Friar. Holy Saint Francis! What a change is here!
15 1598     Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,
15 1599     So soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies
15 1600     Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
15 1601     Jesu Maria! What a deal of brine
15 1602     Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
15 1603     How much salt water thrown away in waste,
15 1604     To season love, that of it doth not taste!
15 1605     The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
15 1606     Thy old groans ring yet in mine ancient ears.
15 1607     Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
15 1608     Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet.
15 1609     If e'er thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,
15 1610     Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline.
15 1611     And art thou chang'd? Pronounce this sentence then:
15 1612     Women may fall when there's no strength in men.
15 1613 
15 1614   Rom. Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
15 1615 
15 1616   Friar. For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
15 1617 
15 1618   Rom. And bad'st me bury love.
15 1619 
15 1620   Friar. Not in a grave
15 1621     To lay one in, another out to have.
15 1622 
15 1623   Rom. I pray thee chide not. She whom I love now
15 1624     Doth grace for grace and love for love allow.
15 1625     The other did not so.
15 1626 
15 1627   Friar. O, she knew well
15 1628     Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.
15 1629     But come, young waverer, come go with me.
15 1630     In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
15 1631     For this alliance may so happy prove
15 1632     To turn your households' rancour to pure love.
15 1633 
15 1634   Rom. O, let us hence! I stand on sudden haste.
15 1635 
15 1636   Friar. Wisely, and slow. They stumble that run fast.
15 1637                                                          Exeunt.

15 1642 Scene IV.
15 1643 A street.
15 1644 
15 1645 Enter Benvolio and Mercutio.
15 1646 
15 1647 
15 1648   Mer. Where the devil should this Romeo be?
15 1649     Came he not home to-night?
15 1650 
15 1651   Ben. Not to his father's. I spoke with his man.
15 1652 
15 1653   Mer. Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline,
15 1654     Torments him so that he will sure run mad.
15 1655 
15 1656   Ben. Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet,
15 1657     Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
15 1658 
15 1659   Mer. A challenge, on my life.
15 1660 
15 1661   Ben. Romeo will answer it.
15 1662 
15 1663   Mer. Any man that can write may answer a letter.
15 1664 
15 1665   Ben. Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares,
15 1666     being dared.
15 1667 
15 1668   Mer. Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead! stabb'd with a white
15 1669     wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love song; the
15 1670     very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's
15 1671     butt-shaft; and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
15 1672 
15 1673   Ben. Why, what is Tybalt?
15 1674 
15 1675   Mer. More than Prince of Cats, I can tell you. O, he's the
15 1676     courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing
15 1677     pricksong-keeps time, distance, and proportion; rests me his
15 1678     minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom! the very
15 1679     butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist! a gentleman
15 1680     of the very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah, the
15 1681     immortal passado! the punto reverse! the hay.
15 1682 
15 1683   Ben. The what?
15 1684 
15 1685   Mer. The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting fantasticoes-
15 1686     these new tuners of accent! 'By Jesu, a very good blade! a very
15 1687     tall man! a very good whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,
15 1688     grandsir, that we should be thus afflicted with these strange
15 1689     flies, these fashion-mongers, these pardona-mi's, who stand
15 1690     so much on the new form that they cannot sit at ease on the old
15 1691     bench? O, their bones, their bones!
15 1692 
15 1693                                Enter Romeo.
15 1694 
15 1695 
15 1696   Ben. Here comes Romeo! here comes Romeo!
15 1697 
15 1698   Mer. Without his roe, like a dried herring. O flesh, flesh, how
15 1699     art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch
15 1700     flowed in. Laura, to his lady, was but a kitchen wench (marry, she
15 1701     had a better love to berhyme her), Dido a dowdy, Cleopatra a gypsy,
15 1702     Helen and Hero hildings and harlots, This be a gray eye or so,
15 1703     but not to the purpose. Signior Romeo, bon jour! There's a French
15 1704     salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
15 1705     fairly last night.
15 1706 
15 1707   Rom. Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
15 1708 
15 1709   Mer. The slip, sir, the slip. Can you not conceive?
15 1710 
15 1711   Rom. Pardon, good Mercutio. My business was great, and in such a
15 1712     case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
15 1713 
15 1714   Mer. That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a
15 1715     man to bow in the hams.
15 1716 
15 1717   Rom. Meaning, to cursy.
15 1718 
15 1719   Mer. Thou hast most kindly hit it.
15 1720 
15 1721   Rom. A most courteous exposition.
15 1722 
15 1723   Mer. Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
15 1724 
15 1725   Rom. Pink for flower.
15 1726 
15 1727   Mer. Right.
15 1728 
15 1729   Rom. Why, then is my pump well-flower'd.
15 1730 
15 1731   Mer. Well said! Follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out
15 1732     thy pump, that, when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may
15 1733     remain, after the wearing, solely singular.
15 1734 
15 1735   Rom. O single-sold jest, solely singular for the singleness!
15 1736 
15 1737   Mer. Come between us, good Benvolio! My wits faint.
15 1738 
15 1739   Rom. Swits and spurs, swits and spurs! or I'll cry a match.
15 1740 
15 1741   Mer. Nay, if our wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done; for
15 1742     thou hast more of the wild goose in one of thy wits than, I am
15 1743     sure, I have in my whole five. Was I with you there for the goose?
15 1744 
15 1745   Rom. Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not
15 1746     there for the goose.
15 1747 
15 1748   Mer. I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
15 1749 
15 1750   Rom. Nay, good goose, bite not!
15 1751 
15 1752   Mer. Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most sharp sauce.
15 1753 
15 1754   Rom. And is it not, then, well serv'd in to a sweet goose?
15 1755 
15 1756   Mer. O, here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch
15 1757     narrow to an ell broad!
15 1758 
15 1759   Rom. I stretch it out for that word 'broad,' which, added to
15 1760     the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.
15 1761 
15 1762   Mer. Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now
15 1763     art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by
15 1764     art as well as by nature. For this drivelling love is like a
15 1765     great natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in
15 1766     a hole.
15 1767 
15 1768   Ben. Stop there, stop there!
15 1769 
15 1770   Mer. Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
15 1771 
15 1772   Ben. Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
15 1773 
15 1774   Mer. O, thou art deceiv'd! I would have made it short; for I
15 1775     was come to the whole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to
15 1776     occupy the argument no longer.
15 1777 
15 1778   Rom. Here's goodly gear!
15 1779 
15 1780                       Enter Nurse and her Man [Peter].
15 1781 
15 1782 
15 1783   Mer. A sail, a sail!
15 1784 
15 1785   Ben. Two, two! a shirt and a smock.
15 1786 
15 1787   Nurse. Peter!
15 1788 
15 1789   Peter. Anon.
15 1790 
15 1791   Nurse. My fan, Peter.
15 1792 
15 1793   Mer. Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the fairer face of
15 1794     the two.
15 1795 
15 1796   Nurse. God ye good morrow, gentlemen.
15 1797 
15 1798   Mer. God ye good-den, fair gentlewoman.
15 1799 
15 1800   Nurse. Is it good-den?
15 1801 
15 1802   Mer. 'Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is
15 1803     now upon the prick of noon.
15 1804 
15 1805   Nurse. Out upon you! What a man are you!
15 1806 
15 1807   Rom. One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar.
15 1808 
15 1809   Nurse. By my troth, it is well said. 'For himself to mar,'
15 1810     quoth 'a? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I may find the
15 1811     young Romeo?
15 1812 
15 1813   Rom. I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when you
15 1814     have found him than he was when you sought him. I am the youngest
15 1815     of that name, for fault of a worse.
15 1816 
15 1817   Nurse. You say well.
15 1818 
15 1819   Mer. Yea, is the worst well? Very well took, i' faith! wisely,
15 1820     wisely.
15 1821 
15 1822   Nurse. If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.
15 1823 
15 1824   Ben. She will endite him to some supper.
15 1825 
15 1826   Mer. A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!
15 1827 
15 1828   Rom. What hast thou found?
15 1829 
15 1830   Mer. No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is
15 1831     something stale and hoar ere it be spent
15 1832                                      He walks by them and sings.
15 1833 
15 1834                    An old hare hoar,
15 1835                    And an old hare hoar,
15 1836                 Is very good meat in Lent;
15 1837                    But a hare that is hoar
15 1838                    Is too much for a score
15 1839                 When it hoars ere it be spent.
15 1840 
15 1841     Romeo, will you come to your father's? We'll to dinner thither.
15 1842 
15 1843   Rom. I will follow you.
15 1844 
15 1845   Mer. Farewell, ancient lady. Farewell,
15 1846     [sings] lady, lady, lady.
15 1847                                       Exeunt Mercutio, Benvolio.
15 1848 
15 1849   Nurse. Marry, farewell! I Pray you, Sir, what saucy merchant
15 1850     was this that was so full of his ropery?
15 1851 
15 1852   Rom. A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk and
15 1853     will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.
15 1854 
15 1855   Nurse. An 'a speak anything against me, I'll take him down, an
15 1856 'a
15 1857     were lustier than he is, and twenty such jacks; and if I cannot,
15 1858     I'll find those that shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his
15 1859     flirt-gills; I am none of his skains-mates. And thou must
15 1860     stand by too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure!
15 1861 
15 1862   Peter. I saw no man use you at his pleasure. If I had, my
15 1863     weapon should quickly have been out, I warrant you. I dare draw as
15 1864     soon as another man, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the
15 1865     law on my side.
15 1866 
15 1867   Nurse. Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me
15 1868     quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word; and, as I told you,
15 1869     my young lady bid me enquire you out. What she bid me say, I
15 1870     will keep to myself; but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead
15 1871     her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of
15 1872     behaviour, as they say; for the gentlewoman is young; and
15 1873     therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were
15 1874     an ill thing to be off'red to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.
15 1875 
15 1876   Rom. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto
15 1877     thee-
15 1878 
15 1879   Nurse. Good heart, and I faith I will tell her as much. Lord,
15 1880     Lord! she will be a joyful woman.
15 1881 
15 1882   Rom. What wilt thou tell her, nurse? Thou dost not mark me.
15 1883 
15 1884   Nurse. I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I
15 1885     take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.
15 1886 
15 1887   Rom. Bid her devise
15 1888     Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
15 1889     And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
15 1890     Be shriv'd and married. Here is for thy pains.
15 1891 
15 1892   Nurse. No, truly, sir; not a penny.
15 1893 
15 1894   Rom. Go to! I say you shall.
15 1895 
15 1896   Nurse. This afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.
15 1897 
15 1898   Rom. And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall.
15 1899     Within this hour my man shall be with thee
15 1900     And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,
15 1901     Which to the high topgallant of my joy
15 1902     Must be my convoy in the secret night.
15 1903     Farewell. Be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains.
15 1904     Farewell. Commend me to thy mistress.
15 1905 
15 1906   Nurse. Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.
15 1907 
15 1908   Rom. What say'st thou, my dear nurse?
15 1909 
15 1910   Nurse. Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
15 1911     Two may keep counsel, putting one away?
15 1912 
15 1913   Rom. I warrant thee my man's as true as steel.
15 1914 
15 1915   Nurse. Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord!
15 1916     when 'twas a little prating thing- O, there is a nobleman in
15 1917     town, one Paris, that would fain lay knife aboard; but she,
15 1918     good soul, had as lieve see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I
15 1919     anger her sometimes, and tell her that Paris is the properer man;
15 1920     but I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any
15 1921     clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin both
15 1922     with a letter?
15 1923 
15 1924   Rom. Ay, nurse; what of that? Both with an R.
15 1925 
15 1926   Nurse. Ah, mocker! that's the dog's name. R is for the- No; I
15 1927     know it begins with some other letter; and she hath the prettiest
15 1928     sententious of it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you
15 1929     good to hear it.
15 1930 
15 1931   Rom. Commend me to thy lady.
15 1932 
15 1933   Nurse. Ay, a thousand times. [Exit Romeo.] Peter!
15 1934 
15 1935   Peter. Anon.
15 1936 
15 1937   Nurse. Peter, take my fan, and go before, and apace.
15 1938                                                          Exeunt.

15 1943 Scene V.
15 1944 Capulet's orchard.
15 1945 
15 1946 Enter Juliet.
15 1947 
15 1948 
15 1949   Jul. The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
15 1950     In half an hour she 'promis'd to return.
15 1951     Perchance she cannot meet him. That's not so.
15 1952     O, she is lame! Love's heralds should be thoughts,
15 1953     Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams
15 1954     Driving back shadows over low'ring hills.
15 1955     Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw Love,
15 1956     And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
15 1957     Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
15 1958     Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
15 1959     Is three long hours; yet she is not come.
15 1960     Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
15 1961     She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
15 1962     My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
15 1963     And his to me,
15 1964     But old folks, many feign as they were dead-
15 1965     Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
15 1966 
15 1967                       Enter Nurse [and Peter].
15 1968 
15 1969     O God, she comes! O honey nurse, what news?
15 1970     Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.
15 1971 
15 1972   Nurse. Peter, stay at the gate.
15 1973                                                    [Exit Peter.]
15 1974 
15 1975   Jul. Now, good sweet nurse- O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
15 1976     Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
15 1977     If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
15 1978     By playing it to me with so sour a face.
15 1979 
15 1980   Nurse. I am aweary, give me leave awhile.
15 1981     Fie, how my bones ache! What a jaunce have I had!
15 1982 
15 1983   Jul. I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news.
15 1984     Nay, come, I pray thee speak. Good, good nurse, speak.
15 1985 
15 1986   Nurse. Jesu, what haste! Can you not stay awhile?
15 1987     Do you not see that I am out of breath?
15 1988 
15 1989   Jul. How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath
15 1990     To say to me that thou art out of breath?
15 1991     The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
15 1992     Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
15 1993     Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that.
15 1994     Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance.
15 1995     Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?
15 1996 
15 1997   Nurse. Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to
15 1998     choose a man. Romeo? No, not he. Though his face be better
15 1999     than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand and a
15 2000     foot, and a body, though they be not to be talk'd on, yet
15 2001     they are past compare. He is not the flower of courtesy, but, I'll
15 2002     warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy ways, wench; serve
15 2003 God.
15 2004     What, have you din'd at home?
15 2005 
15 2006   Jul. No, no. But all this did I know before.
15 2007     What says he of our marriage? What of that?
15 2008 
15 2009   Nurse. Lord, how my head aches! What a head have I!
15 2010     It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
15 2011     My back o' t' other side,- ah, my back, my back!
15 2012     Beshrew your heart for sending me about
15 2013     To catch my death with jauncing up and down!
15 2014 
15 2015   Jul. I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
15 2016     Sweet, sweet, Sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
15 2017 
15 2018   Nurse. Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous,
15 2019     and a kind, and a handsome; and, I warrant, a virtuous- Where
15 2020     is your mother?
15 2021 
15 2022   Jul. Where is my mother? Why, she is within.
15 2023     Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
15 2024     'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
15 2025     "Where is your mother?"'
15 2026 
15 2027   Nurse. O God's Lady dear!
15 2028     Are you so hot? Marry come up, I trow.
15 2029     Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
15 2030     Henceforward do your messages yourself.
15 2031 
15 2032   Jul. Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
15 2033 
15 2034   Nurse. Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?
15 2035 
15 2036   Jul. I have.
15 2037 
15 2038   Nurse. Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
15 2039     There stays a husband to make you a wife.
15 2040     Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks:
15 2041     They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
15 2042     Hie you to church; I must another way,
15 2043     To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
15 2044     Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark.
15 2045     I am the drudge, and toil in your delight;
15 2046     But you shall bear the burthen soon at night.
15 2047     Go; I'll to dinner; hie you to the cell.
15 2048 
15 2049   Jul. Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.
15 2050                                                          Exeunt.

15 2054 
15 2055 Scene VI.
15 2056 Friar Laurence's cell.
15 2057 
15 2058 Enter Friar [Laurence] and Romeo.
15 2059 
15 2060 
15 2061   Friar. So smile the heavens upon this holy act
15 2062     That after-hours with sorrow chide us not!
15 2063 
15 2064   Rom. Amen, amen! But come what sorrow can,
15 2065     It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
15 2066     That one short minute gives me in her sight.
15 2067     Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
15 2068     Then love-devouring death do what he dare-
15 2069     It is enough I may but call her mine.
15 2070 
15 2071   Friar. These violent delights have violent ends
15 2072     And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
15 2073     Which, as they kiss, consume. The sweetest honey
15 2074     Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
15 2075     And in the taste confounds the appetite.
15 2076     Therefore love moderately: long love doth so;
15 2077     Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
15 2078 
15 2079                      Enter Juliet.
15 2080 
15 2081     Here comes the lady. O, so light a foot
15 2082     Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint.
15 2083     A lover may bestride the gossamer
15 2084     That idles in the wanton summer air,
15 2085     And yet not fall; so light is vanity.
15 2086 
15 2087   Jul. Good even to my ghostly confessor.
15 2088 
15 2089   Friar. Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
15 2090 
15 2091   Jul. As much to him, else is his thanks too much.
15 2092 
15 2093   Rom. Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
15 2094     Be heap'd like mine, and that thy skill be more
15 2095     To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
15 2096     This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
15 2097     Unfold the imagin'd happiness that both
15 2098     Receive in either by this dear encounter.
15 2099 
15 2100   Jul. Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
15 2101     Brags of his substance, not of ornament.
15 2102     They are but beggars that can count their worth;
15 2103     But my true love is grown to such excess
15 2104     cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
15 2105 
15 2106   Friar. Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
15 2107     For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
15 2108     Till Holy Church incorporate two in one.
15 2109                                                        [Exeunt.]
15 2110 
15 2111 
15 2112 
15 2113 
15 2114 ACT III. Scene I.
15 2115 A public place.
15 2116 
15 2117 Enter Mercutio, Benvolio, and Men.
15 2118 
15 2119 
15 2120   Ben. I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire.
15 2121     The day is hot, the Capulets abroad.
15 2122     And if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,
15 2123     For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
15 2124 
15 2125   Mer. Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters
15 2126     the confines of a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table and
15 2127     says 'God send me no need of thee!' and by the operation of the
15 2128     second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
15 2129 
15 2130   Ben. Am I like such a fellow?
15 2131 
15 2132   Mer. Come, come, thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as any in
15 2133     Italy; and as soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be
15 2134     moved.
15 2135 
15 2136   Ben. And what to?
15 2137 
15 2138   Mer. Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly,
15 2139     for one would kill the other. Thou! why, thou wilt quarrel with a
15 2140     man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast.
15 2141     Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no
15 2142     other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes. What eye but such an
15 2143     eye would spy out such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of quarrels
15 2144     as an egg is full of meat; and yet thy head hath been beaten as
15 2145     addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast quarrell'd with a
15 2146     man for coughing in the street, because he hath wakened thy dog
15 2147     that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall out with a
15 2148     tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter, with
15 2149     another for tying his new shoes with an old riband? And yet thou wilt
15 2150     tutor me from quarrelling!
15 2151 
15 2152   Ben. An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should
15 2153     buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.
15 2154 
15 2155   Mer. The fee simple? O simple!
15 2156 
15 2157                        Enter Tybalt and others.
15 2158 
15 2159 
15 2160   Ben. By my head, here come the Capulets.
15 2161 
15 2162   Mer. By my heel, I care not.
15 2163 
15 2164   Tyb. Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
15 2165     Gentlemen, good den. A word with one of you.
15 2166 
15 2167   Mer. And but one word with one of us?
15 2168     Couple it with something; make it a word and a blow.
15 2169 
15 2170   Tyb. You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you will give me
15 2171     occasion.
15 2172 
15 2173   Mer. Could you not take some occasion without giving
15 2174 
15 2175   Tyb. Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.
15 2176 
15 2177   Mer. Consort? What, dost thou make us minstrels? An thou make
15 2178     minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but discords. Here's my
15 2179     fiddlestick; here's that shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!
15 2180 
15 2181   Ben. We talk here in the public haunt of men.
15 2182     Either withdraw unto some private place
15 2183     And reason coldly of your grievances,
15 2184     Or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.
15 2185 
15 2186   Mer. Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.
15 2187     I will not budge for no man's pleasure,
15 2188 
15 2189                         Enter Romeo.
15 2190 
15 2191 
15 2192   Tyb. Well, peace be with you, sir. Here comes my man.
15 2193 
15 2194   Mer. But I'll be hang'd, sir, if he wear your livery.
15 2195     Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower!
15 2196     Your worship in that sense may call him man.
15 2197 
15 2198   Tyb. Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford
15 2199     No better term than this: thou art a villain.
15 2200 
15 2201   Rom. Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
15 2202     Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
15 2203     To such a greeting. Villain am I none.
15 2204     Therefore farewell. I see thou knowest me not.
15 2205 
15 2206   Tyb. Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
15 2207     That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.
15 2208 
15 2209   Rom. I do protest I never injur'd thee,
15 2210     But love thee better than thou canst devise
15 2211     Till thou shalt know the reason of my love;
15 2212     And so good Capulet, which name I tender
15 2213     As dearly as mine own, be satisfied.
15 2214 
15 2215   Mer. O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
15 2216     Alla stoccata carries it away.                      [Draws.]
15 2217     Tybalt, you ratcatcher, will you walk?
15 2218 
15 2219   Tyb. What wouldst thou have with me?
15 2220 
15 2221   Mer. Good King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives.
15 2222 That I
15 2223     mean to make bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter,
15 2224 
15 2225     dry-beat the rest of the eight. Will you pluck your sword out
15 2226     of his pitcher by the ears? Make haste, lest mine be about your
15 2227     ears ere it be out.
15 2228 
15 2229   Tyb. I am for you.                                    [Draws.]
15 2230 
15 2231   Rom. Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.
15 2232 
15 2233   Mer. Come, sir, your passado!
15 2234                                                    [They fight.]
15 2235 
15 2236   Rom. Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
15 2237     Gentlemen, for shame! forbear this outrage!
15 2238     Tybalt, Mercutio, the Prince expressly hath
15 2239     Forbid this bandying in Verona streets.
15 2240     Hold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio!
15 2241          Tybalt under Romeo's arm thrusts Mercutio in, and flies
15 2242                                            [with his Followers].
15 2243 
15 2244   Mer. I am hurt.
15 2245     A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
15 2246     Is he gone and hath nothing?
15 2247 
15 2248   Ben. What, art thou hurt?
15 2249 
15 2250   Mer. Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Marry, 'tis enough.
15 2251     Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
15 2252                                                     [Exit Page.]
15 2253 
15 2254   Rom. Courage, man. The hurt cannot be much.
15 2255 
15 2256   Mer. No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door;
15 2257     but 'tis enough, 'twill serve. Ask for me to-morrow, and you
15 2258     shall find me a grave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this
15 2259     world. A plague o' both your houses! Zounds, a dog, a rat, a
15 2260     mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a rogue,
15 2261 a
15 2262     villain, that fights by the book of arithmetic! Why the devil
15 2263     came you between us? I was hurt under your arm.
15 2264 
15 2265   Rom. I thought all for the best.
15 2266 
15 2267   Mer. Help me into some house, Benvolio,
15 2268     Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
15 2269     They have made worms' meat of me. I have it,
15 2270     And soundly too. Your houses!
15 2271                                  [Exit. [supported by Benvolio].
15 2272 
15 2273   Rom. This gentleman, the Prince's near ally,
15 2274     My very friend, hath got this mortal hurt
15 2275     In my behalf- my reputation stain'd
15 2276     With Tybalt's slander- Tybalt, that an hour
15 2277     Hath been my kinsman. O sweet Juliet,
15 2278     Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
15 2279     And in my temper soft'ned valour's steel
15 2280 
15 2281                       Enter Benvolio.
15 2282 
15 2283 
15 2284   Ben. O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
15 2285     That gallant spirit hath aspir'd the clouds,
15 2286     Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
15 2287 
15 2288   Rom. This day's black fate on moe days doth depend;
15 2289     This but begins the woe others must end.
15 2290 
15 2291                        Enter Tybalt.
15 2292 
15 2293 
15 2294   Ben. Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
15 2295 
15 2296   Rom. Alive in triumph, and Mercutio slain?
15 2297     Away to heaven respective lenity,
15 2298     And fire-ey'd fury be my conduct now!
15 2299     Now, Tybalt, take the 'villain' back again
15 2300     That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
15 2301     Is but a little way above our heads,
15 2302     Staying for thine to keep him company.
15 2303     Either thou or I, or both, must go with him.
15 2304 
15 2305   Tyb. Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
15 2306     Shalt with him hence.
15 2307 
15 2308   Rom. This shall determine that.
15 2309                                        They fight. Tybalt falls.
15 2310 
15 2311   Ben. Romeo, away, be gone!
15 2312     The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
15 2313     Stand not amaz'd. The Prince will doom thee death
15 2314     If thou art taken. Hence, be gone, away!
15 2315 
15 2316   Rom. O, I am fortune's fool!
15 2317 
15 2318   Ben. Why dost thou stay?
15 2319                                                      Exit Romeo.
15 2320                       Enter Citizens.
15 2321 
15 2322 
15 2323   Citizen. Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?
15 2324     Tybalt, that murtherer, which way ran he?
15 2325 
15 2326   Ben. There lies that Tybalt.
15 2327 
15 2328   Citizen. Up, sir, go with me.
15 2329     I charge thee in the Prince's name obey.
15 2330 
15 2331 
15 2332   Enter Prince [attended], Old Montague, Capulet, their Wives,
15 2333                      and [others].
15 2334 
15 2335 
15 2336   Prince. Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
15 2337 
15 2338   Ben. O noble Prince. I can discover all
15 2339     The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.
15 2340     There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
15 2341     That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
15 2342 
15 2343   Cap. Wife. Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
15 2344     O Prince! O husband! O, the blood is spill'd
15 2345     Of my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
15 2346     For blood of ours shed blood of Montague.
15 2347     O cousin, cousin!
15 2348 
15 2349   Prince. Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
15 2350 
15 2351   Ben. Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did stay.
15 2352     Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink
15 2353     How nice the quarrel was, and urg'd withal
15 2354     Your high displeasure. All this- uttered
15 2355     With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd-
15 2356     Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
15 2357     Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
15 2358     With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast;
15 2359     Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
15 2360     And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
15 2361     Cold death aside and with the other sends
15 2362     It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity
15 2363     Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,
15 2364     'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and swifter than his tongue,
15 2365     His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
15 2366     And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
15 2367     An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
15 2368     Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
15 2369     But by-and-by comes back to Romeo,
15 2370     Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
15 2371     And to't they go like lightning; for, ere I
15 2372     Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain;
15 2373     And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
15 2374     This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
15 2375 
15 2376   Cap. Wife. He is a kinsman to the Montague;
15 2377     Affection makes him false, he speaks not true.
15 2378     Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
15 2379     And all those twenty could but kill one life.
15 2380     I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give.
15 2381     Romeo slew Tybalt; Romeo must not live.
15 2382 
15 2383   Prince. Romeo slew him; he slew Mercutio.
15 2384     Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
15 2385 
15 2386   Mon. Not Romeo, Prince; he was Mercutio's friend;
15 2387     His fault concludes but what the law should end,
15 2388     The life of Tybalt.
15 2389 
15 2390   Prince. And for that offence
15 2391     Immediately we do exile him hence.
15 2392     I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
15 2393     My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
15 2394     But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
15 2395     That you shall all repent the loss of mine.
15 2396     I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
15 2397     Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.
15 2398     Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,
15 2399     Else, when he is found, that hour is his last.
15 2400     Bear hence this body, and attend our will.
15 2401     Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.
15 2402                                                          Exeunt.

15 2407 Scene II.
15 2408 Capulet's orchard.
15 2409 
15 2410 Enter Juliet alone.
15 2411 
15 2412 
15 2413   Jul. Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
15 2414     Towards Phoebus' lodging! Such a wagoner
15 2415     As Phaeton would whip you to the West
15 2416     And bring in cloudy night immediately.
15 2417     Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
15 2418     That runaway eyes may wink, and Romeo
15 2419     Leap to these arms untalk'd of and unseen.
15 2420     Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
15 2421     By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
15 2422     It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
15 2423     Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
15 2424     And learn me how to lose a winning match,
15 2425     Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.
15 2426     Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
15 2427     With thy black mantle till strange love, grown bold,
15 2428     Think true love acted simple modesty.
15 2429     Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;
15 2430     For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
15 2431     Whiter than new snow upon a raven's back.
15 2432     Come, gentle night; come, loving, black-brow'd night;
15 2433     Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
15 2434     Take him and cut him out in little stars,
15 2435     And he will make the face of heaven so fine
15 2436     That all the world will be in love with night
15 2437     And pay no worship to the garish sun.
15 2438     O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
15 2439     But not possess'd it; and though I am sold,
15 2440     Not yet enjoy'd. So tedious is this day
15 2441     As is the night before some festival
15 2442     To an impatient child that hath new robes
15 2443     And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
15 2444 
15 2445                 Enter Nurse, with cords.
15 2446 
15 2447     And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
15 2448     But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
15 2449     Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
15 2450     That Romeo bid thee fetch?
15 2451 
15 2452   Nurse. Ay, ay, the cords.
15 2453                                              [Throws them down.]
15 2454 
15 2455   Jul. Ay me! what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands
15 2456 
15 2457   Nurse. Ah, weraday! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
15 2458     We are undone, lady, we are undone!
15 2459     Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!
15 2460 
15 2461   Jul. Can heaven be so envious?
15 2462 
15 2463   Nurse. Romeo can,
15 2464     Though heaven cannot. O Romeo, Romeo!
15 2465     Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!
15 2466 
15 2467   Jul. What devil art thou that dost torment me thus?
15 2468     This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
15 2469     Hath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but 'I,'
15 2470     And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
15 2471     Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.
15 2472     I am not I, if there be such an 'I';
15 2473     Or those eyes shut that make thee answer 'I.'
15 2474     If be be slain, say 'I'; or if not, 'no.'
15 2475     Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
15 2476 
15 2477   Nurse. I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,
15 2478     (God save the mark!) here on his manly breast.
15 2479     A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
15 2480     Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
15 2481     All in gore-blood. I swounded at the sight.
15 2482 
15 2483   Jul. O, break, my heart! poor bankrout, break at once!
15 2484     To prison, eyes; ne'er look on liberty!
15 2485     Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here,
15 2486     And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
15 2487 
15 2488   Nurse. O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
15 2489     O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman
15 2490     That ever I should live to see thee dead!
15 2491 
15 2492   Jul. What storm is this that blows so contrary?
15 2493     Is Romeo slaught'red, and is Tybalt dead?
15 2494     My dear-lov'd cousin, and my dearer lord?
15 2495     Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
15 2496     For who is living, if those two are gone?
15 2497 
15 2498   Nurse. Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
15 2499     Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.
15 2500 
15 2501   Jul. O God! Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
15 2502 
15 2503   Nurse. It did, it did! alas the day, it did!
15 2504 
15 2505   Jul. O serpent heart, hid with a flow'ring face!
15 2506     Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
15 2507     Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
15 2508     Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
15 2509     Despised substance of divinest show!
15 2510     Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st-
15 2511     A damned saint, an honourable villain!
15 2512     O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell
15 2513     When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
15 2514     In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?
15 2515     Was ever book containing such vile matter
15 2516     So fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell
15 2517     In such a gorgeous palace!
15 2518 
15 2519   Nurse. There's no trust,
15 2520     No faith, no honesty in men; all perjur'd,
15 2521     All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
15 2522     Ah, where's my man? Give me some aqua vitae.
15 2523     These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
15 2524     Shame come to Romeo!
15 2525 
15 2526   Jul. Blister'd be thy tongue
15 2527     For such a wish! He was not born to shame.
15 2528     Upon his brow shame is asham'd to sit;
15 2529     For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
15 2530     Sole monarch of the universal earth.
15 2531     O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
15 2532 
15 2533   Nurse. Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?
15 2534 
15 2535   Jul. Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
15 2536     Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name
15 2537     When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
15 2538     But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
15 2539     That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband.
15 2540     Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring!
15 2541     Your tributary drops belong to woe,
15 2542     Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
15 2543     My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
15 2544     And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband.
15 2545     All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
15 2546     Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
15 2547     That murd'red me. I would forget it fain;
15 2548     But O, it presses to my memory
15 2549     Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds!
15 2550     'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo- banished.'
15 2551     That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
15 2552     Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
15 2553     Was woe enough, if it had ended there;
15 2554     Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
15 2555     And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
15 2556     Why followed not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
15 2557     Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
15 2558     Which modern lamentation might have mov'd?
15 2559     But with a rearward following Tybalt's death,
15 2560     'Romeo is banished'- to speak that word
15 2561     Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
15 2562     All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished'-
15 2563     There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
15 2564     In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
15 2565     Where is my father and my mother, nurse?
15 2566 
15 2567   Nurse. Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse.
15 2568     Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.
15 2569 
15 2570   Jul. Wash they his wounds with tears? Mine shall be spent,
15 2571     When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
15 2572     Take up those cords. Poor ropes, you are beguil'd,
15 2573     Both you and I, for Romeo is exil'd.
15 2574     He made you for a highway to my bed;
15 2575     But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
15 2576     Come, cords; come, nurse. I'll to my wedding bed;
15 2577     And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
15 2578 
15 2579   Nurse. Hie to your chamber. I'll find Romeo
15 2580     To comfort you. I wot well where he is.
15 2581     Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night.
15 2582     I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.
15 2583 
15 2584   Jul. O, find him! give this ring to my true knight
15 2585     And bid him come to take his last farewell.
15 2586                                                          Exeunt.

15 2590 
15 2591 Scene III.
15 2592 Friar Laurence's cell.
15 2593 
15 2594 Enter Friar [Laurence].
15 2595 
15 2596 
15 2597   Friar. Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.
15 2598     Affliction is enanmour'd of thy parts,
15 2599     And thou art wedded to calamity.
15 2600 
15 2601                          Enter Romeo.
15 2602 
15 2603 
15 2604   Rom. Father, what news? What is the Prince's doom
15 2605     What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand
15 2606     That I yet know not?
15 2607 
15 2608   Friar. Too familiar
15 2609     Is my dear son with such sour company.
15 2610     I bring thee tidings of the Prince's doom.
15 2611 
15 2612   Rom. What less than doomsday is the Prince's doom?
15 2613 
15 2614   Friar. A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips-
15 2615     Not body's death, but body's banishment.
15 2616 
15 2617   Rom. Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say 'death';
15 2618     For exile hath more terror in his look,
15 2619     Much more than death. Do not say 'banishment.'
15 2620 
15 2621   Friar. Hence from Verona art thou banished.
15 2622     Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
15 2623 
15 2624   Rom. There is no world without Verona walls,
15 2625     But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
15 2626     Hence banished is banish'd from the world,
15 2627     And world's exile is death. Then 'banishment'
15 2628     Is death misterm'd. Calling death 'banishment,'
15 2629     Thou cut'st my head off with a golden axe
15 2630     And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
15 2631 
15 2632   Friar. O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
15 2633     Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind Prince,
15 2634     Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
15 2635     And turn'd that black word death to banishment.
15 2636     This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.
15 2637 
15 2638   Rom. 'Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here,
15 2639     Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
15 2640     And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
15 2641     Live here in heaven and may look on her;
15 2642     But Romeo may not. More validity,
15 2643     More honourable state, more courtship lives
15 2644     In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize
15 2645     On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
15 2646     And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
15 2647     Who, even in pure and vestal modesty,
15 2648     Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
15 2649     But Romeo may not- he is banished.
15 2650     This may flies do, when I from this must fly;
15 2651     They are free men, but I am banished.
15 2652     And sayest thou yet that exile is not death?
15 2653     Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
15 2654     No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
15 2655     But 'banished' to kill me- 'banished'?
15 2656     O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
15 2657     Howling attends it! How hast thou the heart,
15 2658     Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
15 2659     A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
15 2660     To mangle me with that word 'banished'?
15 2661 
15 2662   Friar. Thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak.
15 2663 
15 2664   Rom. O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
15 2665 
15 2666   Friar. I'll give thee armour to keep off that word;
15 2667     Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
15 2668     To comfort thee, though thou art banished.
15 2669 
15 2670   Rom. Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
15 2671     Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
15 2672     Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
15 2673     It helps not, it prevails not. Talk no more.
15 2674 
15 2675   Friar. O, then I see that madmen have no ears.
15 2676 
15 2677   Rom. How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
15 2678 
15 2679   Friar. Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
15 2680 
15 2681   Rom. Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.
15 2682     Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
15 2683     An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
15 2684     Doting like me, and like me banished,
15 2685     Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
15 2686     And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
15 2687     Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
15 2688                                                  Knock [within].
15 2689 
15 2690   Friar. Arise; one knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself.
15 2691 
15 2692   Rom. Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
15 2693     Mist-like infold me from the search of eyes.          Knock.
15 2694 
15 2695   Friar. Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;
15 2696     Thou wilt be taken.- Stay awhile!- Stand up;          Knock.
15 2697     Run to my study.- By-and-by!- God's will,
15 2698     What simpleness is this.- I come, I come!             Knock.
15 2699     Who knocks so hard? Whence come you? What's your will
15 2700 
15 2701   Nurse. [within] Let me come in, and you shall know my errand.
15 2702     I come from Lady Juliet.
15 2703 
15 2704   Friar. Welcome then.
15 2705 
15 2706                        Enter Nurse.
15 2707 
15 2708 
15 2709   Nurse. O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar
15 2710     Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?
15 2711 
15 2712   Friar. There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.
15 2713 
15 2714   Nurse. O, he is even in my mistress' case,
15 2715     Just in her case!
15 2716 
15 2717   Friar. O woeful sympathy!
15 2718     Piteous predicament!
15 2719 
15 2720   Nurse. Even so lies she,
15 2721     Blubb'ring and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
15 2722     Stand up, stand up! Stand, an you be a man.
15 2723     For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand!
15 2724     Why should you fall into so deep an O?
15 2725 
15 2726   Rom. (rises) Nurse-
15 2727 
15 2728   Nurse. Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.
15 2729 
15 2730   Rom. Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?
15 2731     Doth not she think me an old murtherer,
15 2732     Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
15 2733     With blood remov'd but little from her own?
15 2734     Where is she? and how doth she! and what says
15 2735     My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?
15 2736 
15 2737   Nurse. O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
15 2738     And now falls on her bed, and then starts up,
15 2739     And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
15 2740     And then down falls again.
15 2741 
15 2742   Rom. As if that name,
15 2743     Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
15 2744     Did murther her; as that name's cursed hand
15 2745     Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,
15 2746     In what vile part of this anatomy
15 2747     Doth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack
15 2748     The hateful mansion.                     [Draws his dagger.]
15 2749 
15 2750   Friar. Hold thy desperate hand.
15 2751     Art thou a man? Thy form cries out thou art;
15 2752     Thy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denote
15 2753     The unreasonable fury of a beast.
15 2754     Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
15 2755     Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
15 2756     Thou hast amaz'd me. By my holy order,
15 2757     I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
15 2758     Hast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself?
15 2759     And slay thy lady that in thy life lives,
15 2760     By doing damned hate upon thyself?
15 2761     Why railest thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
15 2762     Since birth and heaven and earth, all three do meet
15 2763     In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
15 2764     Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit,
15 2765     Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
15 2766     And usest none in that true use indeed
15 2767     Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.
15 2768     Thy noble shape is but a form of wax
15 2769     Digressing from the valour of a man;
15 2770     Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
15 2771     Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
15 2772     Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
15 2773     Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
15 2774     Like powder in a skilless soldier's flask,
15 2775     is get afire by thine own ignorance,
15 2776     And thou dismemb'red with thine own defence.
15 2777     What, rouse thee, man! Thy Juliet is alive,
15 2778     For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead.
15 2779     There art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,
15 2780     But thou slewest Tybalt. There art thou happy too.
15 2781     The law, that threat'ned death, becomes thy friend
15 2782     And turns it to exile. There art thou happy.
15 2783     A pack of blessings light upon thy back;
15 2784     Happiness courts thee in her best array;
15 2785     But, like a misbhav'd and sullen wench,
15 2786     Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love.
15 2787     Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
15 2788     Go get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
15 2789     Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her.
15 2790     But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
15 2791     For then thou canst not pass to Mantua,
15 2792     Where thou shalt live till we can find a time
15 2793     To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
15 2794     Beg pardon of the Prince, and call thee back
15 2795     With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
15 2796     Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
15 2797     Go before, nurse. Commend me to thy lady,
15 2798     And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
15 2799     Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.
15 2800     Romeo is coming.
15 2801 
15 2802   Nurse. O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
15 2803     To hear good counsel. O, what learning is!
15 2804     My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.
15 2805 
15 2806   Rom. Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
15 2807 
15 2808   Nurse. Here is a ring she bid me give you, sir.
15 2809     Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.           Exit.
15 2810 
15 2811   Rom. How well my comfort is reviv'd by this!
15 2812 
15 2813   Friar. Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
15 2814     Either be gone before the watch be set,
15 2815     Or by the break of day disguis'd from hence.
15 2816     Sojourn in Mantua. I'll find out your man,
15 2817     And he shall signify from time to time
15 2818     Every good hap to you that chances here.
15 2819     Give me thy hand. 'Tis late. Farewell; good night.
15 2820 
15 2821   Rom. But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
15 2822     It were a grief so brief to part with thee.
15 2823     Farewell.
15 2824                                                          Exeunt.

15 2829 Scene IV.
15 2830 Capulet's house
15 2831 
15 2832 Enter Old Capulet, his Wife, and Paris.
15 2833 
15 2834 
15 2835   Cap. Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily
15 2836     That we have had no time to move our daughter.
15 2837     Look you, she lov'd her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
15 2838     And so did I. Well, we were born to die.
15 2839     'Tis very late; she'll not come down to-night.
15 2840     I promise you, but for your company,
15 2841     I would have been abed an hour ago.
15 2842 
15 2843   Par. These times of woe afford no tune to woo.
15 2844     Madam, good night. Commend me to your daughter.
15 2845 
15 2846   Lady. I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
15 2847     To-night she's mew'd up to her heaviness.
15 2848 
15 2849   Cap. Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
15 2850     Of my child's love. I think she will be rul'd
15 2851     In all respects by me; nay more, I doubt it not.
15 2852     Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
15 2853     Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love
15 2854     And bid her (mark you me?) on Wednesday next-
15 2855     But, soft! what day is this?
15 2856 
15 2857   Par. Monday, my lord.
15 2858 
15 2859   Cap. Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon.
15 2860     Thursday let it be- a Thursday, tell her
15 2861     She shall be married to this noble earl.
15 2862     Will you be ready? Do you like this haste?
15 2863     We'll keep no great ado- a friend or two;
15 2864     For hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
15 2865     It may be thought we held him carelessly,
15 2866     Being our kinsman, if we revel much.
15 2867     Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
15 2868     And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
15 2869 
15 2870   Par. My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.
15 2871 
15 2872   Cap. Well, get you gone. A Thursday be it then.
15 2873     Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed;
15 2874     Prepare her, wife, against this wedding day.
15 2875     Farewell, My lord.- Light to my chamber, ho!
15 2876     Afore me, It is so very very late
15 2877     That we may call it early by-and-by.
15 2878     Good night.
15 2879                                                           Exeunt

15 2883 
15 2884 Scene V.
15 2885 Capulet's orchard.
15 2886 
15 2887 Enter Romeo and Juliet aloft, at the Window.
15 2888 
15 2889 
15 2890   Jul. Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
15 2891     It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
15 2892     That pierc'd the fearful hollow of thine ear.
15 2893     Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.
15 2894     Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
15 2895 
15 2896   Rom. It was the lark, the herald of the morn;
15 2897     No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks
15 2898     Do lace the severing clouds in yonder East.
15 2899     Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
15 2900     Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
15 2901     I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
15 2902 
15 2903   Jul. Yond light is not daylight; I know it, I.
15 2904     It is some meteor that the sun exhales
15 2905     To be to thee this night a torchbearer
15 2906     And light thee on the way to Mantua.
15 2907     Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.
15 2908 
15 2909   Rom. Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death.
15 2910     I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
15 2911     I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
15 2912     'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
15 2913     Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat
15 2914     The vaulty heaven so high above our heads.
15 2915     I have more care to stay than will to go.
15 2916     Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
15 2917     How is't, my soul? Let's talk; it is not day.
15 2918 
15 2919   Jul. It is, it is! Hie hence, be gone, away!
15 2920     It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
15 2921     Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
15 2922     Some say the lark makes sweet division;
15 2923     This doth not so, for she divideth us.
15 2924     Some say the lark and loathed toad chang'd eyes;
15 2925     O, now I would they had chang'd voices too,
15 2926     Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
15 2927     Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day!
15 2928     O, now be gone! More light and light it grows.
15 2929 
15 2930   Rom. More light and light- more dark and dark our woes!
15 2931 
15 2932                           Enter Nurse.
15 2933 
15 2934 
15 2935   Nurse. Madam!
15 2936 
15 2937   Jul. Nurse?
15 2938 
15 2939   Nurse. Your lady mother is coming to your chamber.
15 2940     The day is broke; be wary, look about.
15 2941 
15 2942   Jul. Then, window, let day in, and let life out.
15 2943                                                          [Exit.]
15 2944 
15 2945   Rom. Farewell, farewell! One kiss, and I'll descend.
15 2946                                                   He goeth down.
15 2947 
15 2948   Jul. Art thou gone so, my lord, my love, my friend?
15 2949     I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
15 2950     For in a minute there are many days.
15 2951     O, by this count I shall be much in years
15 2952     Ere I again behold my Romeo!
15 2953 
15 2954   Rom. Farewell!
15 2955     I will omit no opportunity
15 2956     That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
15 2957 
15 2958   Jul. O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
15 2959 
15 2960   Rom. I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
15 2961     For sweet discourses in our time to come.
15 2962 
15 2963   Jul. O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
15 2964     Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
15 2965     As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.
15 2966     Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
15 2967 
15 2968   Rom. And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.
15 2969     Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!
15 2970 Exit.
15 2971 
15 2972   Jul. O Fortune, Fortune! all men call thee fickle.
15 2973     If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him
15 2974     That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, Fortune,
15 2975     For then I hope thou wilt not keep him long
15 2976     But send him back.
15 2977 
15 2978   Lady. [within] Ho, daughter! are you up?
15 2979 
15 2980   Jul. Who is't that calls? It is my lady mother.
15 2981     Is she not down so late, or up so early?
15 2982     What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?
15 2983 
15 2984                        Enter Mother.
15 2985 
15 2986 
15 2987   Lady. Why, how now, Juliet?
15 2988 
15 2989   Jul. Madam, I am not well.
15 2990 
15 2991   Lady. Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
15 2992     What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
15 2993     An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.
15 2994     Therefore have done. Some grief shows much of love;
15 2995     But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
15 2996 
15 2997   Jul. Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
15 2998 
15 2999   Lady. So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
15 3000     Which you weep for.
15 3001 
15 3002   Jul. Feeling so the loss,
15 3003     I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
15 3004 
15 3005   Lady. Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death
15 3006     As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.
15 3007 
15 3008   Jul. What villain, madam?
15 3009 
15 3010   Lady. That same villain Romeo.
15 3011 
15 3012   Jul. [aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.-
15 3013     God pardon him! I do, with all my heart;
15 3014     And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
15 3015 
15 3016   Lady. That is because the traitor murderer lives.
15 3017 
15 3018   Jul. Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.
15 3019     Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!
15 3020 
15 3021   Lady. We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.
15 3022     Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
15 3023     Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
15 3024     Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram
15 3025     That he shall soon keep Tybalt company;
15 3026     And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.
15 3027 
15 3028   Jul. Indeed I never shall be satisfied
15 3029     With Romeo till I behold him- dead-
15 3030     Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex'd.
15 3031     Madam, if you could find out but a man
15 3032     To bear a poison, I would temper it;
15 3033     That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
15 3034     Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
15 3035     To hear him nam'd and cannot come to him,
15 3036     To wreak the love I bore my cousin Tybalt
15 3037     Upon his body that hath slaughter'd him!
15 3038 
15 3039   Lady. Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
15 3040     But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
15 3041 
15 3042   Jul. And joy comes well in such a needy time.
15 3043     What are they, I beseech your ladyship?
15 3044 
15 3045   Lady. Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
15 3046     One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
15 3047     Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy
15 3048     That thou expects not nor I look'd not for.
15 3049 
15 3050   Jul. Madam, in happy time! What day is that?
15 3051 
15 3052   Lady. Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn
15 3053     The gallant, young, and noble gentleman,
15 3054     The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
15 3055     Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
15 3056 
15 3057   Jul. Now by Saint Peter's Church, and Peter too,
15 3058     He shall not make me there a joyful bride!
15 3059     I wonder at this haste, that I must wed
15 3060     Ere he that should be husband comes to woo.
15 3061     I pray you tell my lord and father, madam,
15 3062     I will not marry yet; and when I do, I swear
15 3063     It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
15 3064     Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!
15 3065 
15 3066   Lady. Here comes your father. Tell him so yourself,
15 3067     And see how be will take it at your hands.
15 3068 
15 3069                    Enter Capulet and Nurse.
15 3070 
15 3071 
15 3072   Cap. When the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew,
15 3073     But for the sunset of my brother's son
15 3074     It rains downright.
15 3075     How now? a conduit, girl? What, still in tears?
15 3076     Evermore show'ring? In one little body
15 3077     Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind:
15 3078     For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
15 3079     Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is
15 3080     Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs,
15 3081     Who, raging with thy tears and they with them,
15 3082     Without a sudden calm will overset
15 3083     Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife?
15 3084     Have you delivered to her our decree?
15 3085 
15 3086   Lady. Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
15 3087     I would the fool were married to her grave!
15 3088 
15 3089   Cap. Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
15 3090     How? Will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?
15 3091     Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blest,
15 3092     Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
15 3093     So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
15 3094 
15 3095   Jul. Not proud you have, but thankful that you have.
15 3096     Proud can I never be of what I hate,
15 3097     But thankful even for hate that is meant love.
15 3098 
15 3099   Cap. How, how, how, how, choplogic? What is this?
15 3100     'Proud'- and 'I thank you'- and 'I thank you not'-
15 3101     And yet 'not proud'? Mistress minion you,
15 3102     Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,
15 3103     But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next
15 3104     To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
15 3105     Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
15 3106     Out, you green-sickness carrion I out, you baggage!
15 3107     You tallow-face!
15 3108 
15 3109   Lady. Fie, fie! what, are you mad?
15 3110 
15 3111   Jul. Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
15 3112     Hear me with patience but to speak a word.
15 3113 
15 3114   Cap. Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
15 3115     I tell thee what- get thee to church a Thursday
15 3116     Or never after look me in the face.
15 3117     Speak not, reply not, do not answer me!
15 3118     My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
15 3119     That God had lent us but this only child;
15 3120     But now I see this one is one too much,
15 3121     And that we have a curse in having her.
15 3122     Out on her, hilding!
15 3123 
15 3124   Nurse. God in heaven bless her!
15 3125     You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.
15 3126 
15 3127   Cap. And why, my Lady Wisdom? Hold your tongue,
15 3128     Good Prudence. Smatter with your gossips, go!
15 3129 
15 3130   Nurse. I speak no treason.
15 3131 
15 3132   Cap. O, God-i-god-en!
15 3133 
15 3134   Nurse. May not one speak?
15 3135 
15 3136   Cap. Peace, you mumbling fool!
15 3137     Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl,
15 3138     For here we need it not.
15 3139 
15 3140   Lady. You are too hot.
15 3141 
15 3142   Cap. God's bread I it makes me mad. Day, night, late, early,
15 3143     At home, abroad, alone, in company,
15 3144     Waking or sleeping, still my care hath been
15 3145     To have her match'd; and having now provided
15 3146     A gentleman of princely parentage,
15 3147     Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
15 3148     Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
15 3149     Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man-
15 3150     And then to have a wretched puling fool,
15 3151     A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
15 3152     To answer 'I'll not wed, I cannot love;
15 3153     I am too young, I pray you pardon me'!
15 3154     But, an you will not wed, I'll pardon you.
15 3155     Graze where you will, you shall not house with me.
15 3156     Look to't, think on't; I do not use to jest.
15 3157     Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
15 3158     An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
15 3159     An you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,
15 3160     For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
15 3161     Nor what is mine shall never do thee good.
15 3162     Trust to't. Bethink you. I'll not be forsworn.         Exit.
15 3163 
15 3164   Jul. Is there no pity sitting in the clouds
15 3165     That sees into the bottom of my grief?
15 3166     O sweet my mother, cast me not away!
15 3167     Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
15 3168     Or if you do not, make the bridal bed
15 3169     In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
15 3170 
15 3171   Lady. Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word.
15 3172     Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.            Exit.
15 3173 
15 3174   Jul. O God!- O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
15 3175     My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven.
15 3176     How shall that faith return again to earth
15 3177     Unless that husband send it me from heaven
15 3178     By leaving earth? Comfort me, counsel me.
15 3179     Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
15 3180     Upon so soft a subject as myself!
15 3181     What say'st thou? Hast thou not a word of joy?
15 3182     Some comfort, nurse.
15 3183 
15 3184   Nurse. Faith, here it is.
15 3185     Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing
15 3186     That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
15 3187     Or if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
15 3188     Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
15 3189     I think it best you married with the County.
15 3190     O, he's a lovely gentleman!
15 3191     Romeo's a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam,
15 3192     Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
15 3193     As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
15 3194     I think you are happy in this second match,
15 3195     For it excels your first; or if it did not,
15 3196     Your first is dead- or 'twere as good he were
15 3197     As living here and you no use of him.
15 3198 
15 3199   Jul. Speak'st thou this from thy heart?
15 3200 
15 3201   Nurse. And from my soul too; else beshrew them both.
15 3202 
15 3203   Jul. Amen!
15 3204 
15 3205   Nurse. What?
15 3206 
15 3207   Jul. Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
15 3208     Go in; and tell my lady I am gone,
15 3209     Having displeas'd my father, to Laurence' cell,
15 3210     To make confession and to be absolv'd.
15 3211 
15 3212   Nurse. Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.           Exit.
15 3213 
15 3214   Jul. Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
15 3215     Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
15 3216     Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
15 3217     Which she hath prais'd him with above compare
15 3218     So many thousand times? Go, counsellor!
15 3219     Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
15 3220     I'll to the friar to know his remedy.
15 3221     If all else fail, myself have power to die.            Exit.
15 3222 
15 3223 
15 3224 
15 3225 
15 3226 ACT IV. Scene I.
15 3227 Friar Laurence's cell.
15 3228 
15 3229 Enter Friar, [Laurence] and County Paris.
15 3230 
15 3231 
15 3232   Friar. On Thursday, sir? The time is very short.
15 3233 
15 3234   Par. My father Capulet will have it so,
15 3235     And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
15 3236 
15 3237   Friar. You say you do not know the lady's mind.
15 3238     Uneven is the course; I like it not.
15 3239 
15 3240   Par. Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
15 3241     And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
15 3242     For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
15 3243     Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
15 3244     That she do give her sorrow so much sway,
15 3245     And in his wisdom hastes our marriage
15 3246     To stop the inundation of her tears,
15 3247     Which, too much minded by herself alone,
15 3248     May be put from her by society.
15 3249     Now do you know the reason of this haste.
15 3250 
15 3251   Friar. [aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.-
15 3252     Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.
15 3253 
15 3254                     Enter Juliet.
15 3255 
15 3256 
15 3257   Par. Happily met, my lady and my wife!
15 3258 
15 3259   Jul. That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
15 3260 
15 3261   Par. That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.
15 3262 
15 3263   Jul. What must be shall be.
15 3264 
15 3265   Friar. That's a certain text.
15 3266 
15 3267   Par. Come you to make confession to this father?
15 3268 
15 3269   Jul. To answer that, I should confess to you.
15 3270 
15 3271   Par. Do not deny to him that you love me.
15 3272 
15 3273   Jul. I will confess to you that I love him.
15 3274 
15 3275   Par. So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
15 3276 
15 3277   Jul. If I do so, it will be of more price,
15 3278     Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.
15 3279 
15 3280   Par. Poor soul, thy face is much abus'd with tears.
15 3281 
15 3282   Jul. The tears have got small victory by that,
15 3283     For it was bad enough before their spite.
15 3284 
15 3285   Par. Thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report.
15 3286 
15 3287   Jul. That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
15 3288     And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
15 3289 
15 3290   Par. Thy face is mine, and thou hast sland'red it.
15 3291 
15 3292   Jul. It may be so, for it is not mine own.
15 3293     Are you at leisure, holy father, now,
15 3294     Or shall I come to you at evening mass
15 3295 
15 3296   Friar. My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
15 3297     My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
15 3298 
15 3299   Par. God shield I should disturb devotion!
15 3300     Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye.
15 3301     Till then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss.             Exit.
15 3302 
15 3303   Jul. O, shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
15 3304     Come weep with me- past hope, past cure, past help!
15 3305 
15 3306   Friar. Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
15 3307     It strains me past the compass of my wits.
15 3308     I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
15 3309     On Thursday next be married to this County.
15 3310 
15 3311   Jul. Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
15 3312     Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.
15 3313     If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help,
15 3314     Do thou but call my resolution wise
15 3315     And with this knife I'll help it presently.
15 3316     God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
15 3317     And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo's seal'd,
15 3318     Shall be the label to another deed,
15 3319     Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
15 3320     Turn to another, this shall slay them both.
15 3321     Therefore, out of thy long-experienc'd time,
15 3322     Give me some present counsel; or, behold,
15 3323     'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
15 3324     Shall play the empire, arbitrating that
15 3325     Which the commission of thy years and art
15 3326     Could to no issue of true honour bring.
15 3327     Be not so long to speak. I long to die
15 3328     If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.
15 3329 
15 3330   Friar. Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope,
15 3331     Which craves as desperate an execution
15 3332     As that is desperate which we would prevent.
15 3333     If, rather than to marry County Paris
15 3334     Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
15 3335     Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
15 3336     A thing like death to chide away this shame,
15 3337     That cop'st with death himself to scape from it;
15 3338     And, if thou dar'st, I'll give thee remedy.
15 3339 
15 3340   Jul. O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
15 3341     From off the battlements of yonder tower,
15 3342     Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk
15 3343     Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears,
15 3344     Or shut me nightly in a charnel house,
15 3345     O'ercover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
15 3346     With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
15 3347     Or bid me go into a new-made grave
15 3348     And hide me with a dead man in his shroud-
15 3349     Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble-
15 3350     And I will do it without fear or doubt,
15 3351     To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.
15 3352 
15 3353   Friar. Hold, then. Go home, be merry, give consent
15 3354     To marry Paris. Wednesday is to-morrow.
15 3355     To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;
15 3356     Let not the nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.
15 3357     Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
15 3358     And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
15 3359     When presently through all thy veins shall run
15 3360     A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse
15 3361     Shall keep his native progress, but surcease;
15 3362     No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
15 3363     The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
15 3364     To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall
15 3365     Like death when he shuts up the day of life;
15 3366     Each part, depriv'd of supple government,
15 3367     Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death;
15 3368     And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death
15 3369     Thou shalt continue two-and-forty hours,
15 3370     And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
15 3371     Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
15 3372     To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.
15 3373     Then, as the manner of our country is,
15 3374     In thy best robes uncovered on the bier
15 3375     Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
15 3376     Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
15 3377     In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
15 3378     Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift;
15 3379     And hither shall he come; and he and I
15 3380     Will watch thy waking, and that very night
15 3381     Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
15 3382     And this shall free thee from this present shame,
15 3383     If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear
15 3384     Abate thy valour in the acting it.
15 3385 
15 3386   Jul. Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!
15 3387 
15 3388   Friar. Hold! Get you gone, be strong and prosperous
15 3389     In this resolve. I'll send a friar with speed
15 3390     To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.
15 3391 
15 3392   Jul. Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
15 3393     Farewell, dear father.
15 3394                                                          Exeunt.

15 3398 
15 3399 Scene II.
15 3400 Capulet's house.
15 3401 
15 3402 Enter Father Capulet, Mother, Nurse, and Servingmen,
15 3403                         two or three.
15 3404 
15 3405 
15 3406   Cap. So many guests invite as here are writ.
15 3407                                             [Exit a Servingman.]
15 3408     Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.
15 3409 
15 3410   Serv. You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they can
15 3411     lick their fingers.
15 3412 
15 3413   Cap. How canst thou try them so?
15 3414 
15 3415   Serv. Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own
15 3416     fingers. Therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not
15 3417     with me.
15 3418 
15 3419   Cap. Go, begone.
15 3420                                                 Exit Servingman.
15 3421     We shall be much unfurnish'd for this time.
15 3422     What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?
15 3423 
15 3424   Nurse. Ay, forsooth.
15 3425 
15 3426   Cap. Well, be may chance to do some good on her.
15 3427     A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.
15 3428 
15 3429                         Enter Juliet.
15 3430 
15 3431 
15 3432   Nurse. See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
15 3433 
15 3434   Cap. How now, my headstrong? Where have you been gadding?
15 3435 
15 3436   Jul. Where I have learnt me to repent the sin
15 3437     Of disobedient opposition
15 3438     To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd
15 3439     By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here
15 3440     To beg your pardon. Pardon, I beseech you!
15 3441     Henceforward I am ever rul'd by you.
15 3442 
15 3443   Cap. Send for the County. Go tell him of this.
15 3444     I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.
15 3445 
15 3446   Jul. I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell
15 3447     And gave him what becomed love I might,
15 3448     Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty.
15 3449 
15 3450   Cap. Why, I am glad on't. This is well. Stand up.
15 3451     This is as't should be. Let me see the County.
15 3452     Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
15 3453     Now, afore God, this reverend holy friar,
15 3454     All our whole city is much bound to him.
15 3455 
15 3456   Jul. Nurse, will you go with me into my closet
15 3457     To help me sort such needful ornaments
15 3458     As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?
15 3459 
15 3460   Mother. No, not till Thursday. There is time enough.
15 3461 
15 3462   Cap. Go, nurse, go with her. We'll to church to-morrow.
15 3463                                         Exeunt Juliet and Nurse.
15 3464 
15 3465   Mother. We shall be short in our provision.
15 3466     'Tis now near night.
15 3467 
15 3468   Cap. Tush, I will stir about,
15 3469     And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife.
15 3470     Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her.
15 3471     I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone.
15 3472     I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
15 3473     They are all forth; well, I will walk myself
15 3474     To County Paris, to prepare him up
15 3475     Against to-morrow. My heart is wondrous light,
15 3476     Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.
15 3477                                                          Exeunt.

15 3482 Scene III.
15 3483 Juliet's chamber.
15 3484 
15 3485 Enter Juliet and Nurse.
15 3486 
15 3487 
15 3488   Jul. Ay, those attires are best; but, gentle nurse,
15 3489     I pray thee leave me to myself to-night;
15 3490     For I have need of many orisons
15 3491     To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
15 3492     Which, well thou knowest, is cross and full of sin.
15 3493 
15 3494                           Enter Mother.
15 3495 
15 3496 
15 3497   Mother. What, are you busy, ho? Need you my help?
15 3498 
15 3499   Jul. No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
15 3500     As are behooffull for our state to-morrow.
15 3501     So please you, let me now be left alone,
15 3502     And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
15 3503     For I am sure you have your hands full all
15 3504     In this so sudden business.
15 3505 
15 3506   Mother. Good night.
15 3507     Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.
15 3508                                       Exeunt [Mother and Nurse.]
15 3509 
15 3510   Jul. Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
15 3511     I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins
15 3512     That almost freezes up the heat of life.
15 3513     I'll call them back again to comfort me.
15 3514     Nurse!- What should she do here?
15 3515     My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
15 3516     Come, vial.
15 3517     What if this mixture do not work at all?
15 3518     Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
15 3519     No, No! This shall forbid it. Lie thou there.
15 3520                                              Lays down a dagger.
15 3521     What if it be a poison which the friar
15 3522     Subtilly hath minist'red to have me dead,
15 3523     Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd
15 3524     Because he married me before to Romeo?
15 3525     I fear it is; and yet methinks it should not,
15 3526     For he hath still been tried a holy man.
15 3527     I will not entertain so bad a thought.
15 3528     How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
15 3529     I wake before the time that Romeo
15 3530     Come to redeem me? There's a fearful point!
15 3531     Shall I not then be stifled in the vault,
15 3532     To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
15 3533     And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
15 3534     Or, if I live, is it not very like
15 3535     The horrible conceit of death and night,
15 3536     Together with the terror of the place-
15 3537     As in a vault, an ancient receptacle
15 3538     Where for this many hundred years the bones
15 3539     Of all my buried ancestors are pack'd;
15 3540     Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
15 3541     Lies fest'ring in his shroud; where, as they say,
15 3542     At some hours in the night spirits resort-
15 3543     Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
15 3544     So early waking- what with loathsome smells,
15 3545     And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,
15 3546     That living mortals, hearing them, run mad-
15 3547     O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
15 3548     Environed with all these hideous fears,
15 3549     And madly play with my forefathers' joints,
15 3550     And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud.,
15 3551     And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone
15 3552     As with a club dash out my desp'rate brains?
15 3553     O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
15 3554     Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
15 3555     Upon a rapier's point. Stay, Tybalt, stay!
15 3556     Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.
15 3557 
15 3558         She [drinks and] falls upon her bed within the curtains.

15 3565 
15 3566 Enter Lady of the House and Nurse.
15 3567 
15 3568 
15 3569   Lady. Hold, take these keys and fetch more spices, nurse.
15 3570 
15 3571   Nurse. They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.
15 3572 
15 3573                        Enter Old Capulet.
15 3574 
15 3575 
15 3576   Cap. Come, stir, stir, stir! The second cock hath crow'd,
15 3577     The curfew bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock.
15 3578     Look to the bak'd meats, good Angelica;
15 3579     Spare not for cost.
15 3580 
15 3581   Nurse. Go, you cot-quean, go,
15 3582     Get you to bed! Faith, you'll be sick to-morrow
15 3583     For this night's watching.
15 3584 
15 3585   Cap. No, not a whit. What, I have watch'd ere now
15 3586     All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
15 3587 
15 3588   Lady. Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
15 3589     But I will watch you from such watching now.
15 3590                                           Exeunt Lady and Nurse.
15 3591 
15 3592   Cap. A jealous hood, a jealous hood!
15 3593 
15 3594 
15 3595   Enter three or four [Fellows, with spits and logs and baskets.
15 3596 
15 3597     What is there? Now, fellow,
15 3598 
15 3599   Fellow. Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.
15 3600 
15 3601   Cap. Make haste, make haste. [Exit Fellow.] Sirrah, fetch drier
15 3602       logs.
15 3603     Call Peter; he will show thee where they are.
15 3604 
15 3605   Fellow. I have a head, sir, that will find out logs
15 3606     And never trouble Peter for the matter.
15 3607 
15 3608   Cap. Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!
15 3609     Thou shalt be loggerhead. [Exit Fellow.] Good faith, 'tis day.
15 3610     The County will be here with music straight,
15 3611     For so he said he would.                         Play music.
15 3612     I hear him near.
15 3613     Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!
15 3614 
15 3615                               Enter Nurse.
15 3616     Go waken Juliet; go and trim her up.
15 3617     I'll go and chat with Paris. Hie, make haste,
15 3618     Make haste! The bridegroom he is come already:
15 3619     Make haste, I say.
15 3620                                                        [Exeunt.]

15 3626 Juliet's chamber.
15 3627 
15 3628 [Enter Nurse.]
15 3629 
15 3630 
15 3631   Nurse. Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! Fast, I warrant her, she.
15 3632     Why, lamb! why, lady! Fie, you slug-abed!
15 3633     Why, love, I say! madam! sweetheart! Why, bride!
15 3634     What, not a word? You take your pennyworths now!
15 3635     Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
15 3636     The County Paris hath set up his rest
15 3637     That you shall rest but little. God forgive me!
15 3638     Marry, and amen. How sound is she asleep!
15 3639     I needs must wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
15 3640     Ay, let the County take you in your bed!
15 3641     He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?
15 3642                                      [Draws aside the curtains.]
15 3643     What, dress'd, and in your clothes, and down again?
15 3644     I must needs wake you. Lady! lady! lady!
15 3645     Alas, alas! Help, help! My lady's dead!
15 3646     O weraday that ever I was born!
15 3647     Some aqua-vitae, ho! My lord! my lady!
15 3648 
15 3649                            Enter Mother.
15 3650 
15 3651 
15 3652   Mother. What noise is here?
15 3653 
15 3654   Nurse. O lamentable day!
15 3655 
15 3656   Mother. What is the matter?
15 3657 
15 3658   Nurse. Look, look! O heavy day!
15 3659 
15 3660   Mother. O me, O me! My child, my only life!
15 3661     Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
15 3662     Help, help! Call help.
15 3663 
15 3664                             Enter Father.
15 3665 
15 3666 
15 3667   Father. For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.
15 3668 
15 3669   Nurse. She's dead, deceas'd; she's dead! Alack the day!
15 3670 
15 3671   Mother. Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!
15 3672 
15 3673   Cap. Ha! let me see her. Out alas! she's cold,
15 3674     Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
15 3675     Life and these lips have long been separated.
15 3676     Death lies on her like an untimely frost
15 3677     Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
15 3678 
15 3679   Nurse. O lamentable day!
15 3680 
15 3681   Mother. O woful time!
15 3682 
15 3683   Cap. Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
15 3684     Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak.
15 3685 
15 3686 
15 3687   Enter Friar [Laurence] and the County [Paris], with Musicians.
15 3688 
15 3689 
15 3690   Friar. Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
15 3691 
15 3692   Cap. Ready to go, but never to return.
15 3693     O son, the night before thy wedding day
15 3694     Hath Death lain with thy wife. See, there she lies,
15 3695     Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
15 3696     Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;
15 3697     My daughter he hath wedded. I will die
15 3698     And leave him all. Life, living, all is Death's.
15 3699 
15 3700   Par. Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
15 3701     And doth it give me such a sight as this?
15 3702 
15 3703   Mother. Accurs'd, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
15 3704     Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
15 3705     In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
15 3706     But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
15 3707     But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
15 3708     And cruel Death hath catch'd it from my sight!
15 3709 
15 3710   Nurse. O woe? O woful, woful, woful day!
15 3711     Most lamentable day, most woful day
15 3712     That ever ever I did yet behold!
15 3713     O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
15 3714     Never was seen so black a day as this.
15 3715     O woful day! O woful day!
15 3716 
15 3717   Par. Beguil'd, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
15 3718     Most detestable Death, by thee beguil'd,
15 3719     By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!
15 3720     O love! O life! not life, but love in death
15 3721 
15 3722   Cap. Despis'd, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
15 3723     Uncomfortable time, why cam'st thou now
15 3724     To murther, murther our solemnity?
15 3725     O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
15 3726     Dead art thou, dead! alack, my child is dead,
15 3727     And with my child my joys are buried!
15 3728 
15 3729   Friar. Peace, ho, for shame! Confusion's cure lives not
15 3730     In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
15 3731     Had part in this fair maid! now heaven hath all,
15 3732     And all the better is it for the maid.
15 3733     Your part in her you could not keep from death,
15 3734     But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
15 3735     The most you sought was her promotion,
15 3736     For 'twas your heaven she should be advanc'd;
15 3737     And weep ye now, seeing she is advanc'd
15 3738     Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
15 3739     O, in this love, you love your child so ill
15 3740     That you run mad, seeing that she is well.
15 3741     She's not well married that lives married long,
15 3742     But she's best married that dies married young.
15 3743     Dry up your tears and stick your rosemary
15 3744     On this fair corse, and, as the custom is,
15 3745     In all her best array bear her to church;
15 3746     For though fond nature bids us all lament,
15 3747     Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.
15 3748 
15 3749   Cap. All things that we ordained festival
15 3750     Turn from their office to black funeral-
15 3751     Our instruments to melancholy bells,
15 3752     Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast;
15 3753     Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change;
15 3754     Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse;
15 3755     And all things change them to the contrary.
15 3756 
15 3757   Friar. Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;
15 3758     And go, Sir Paris. Every one prepare
15 3759     To follow this fair corse unto her grave.
15 3760     The heavens do low'r upon you for some ill;
15 3761     Move them no more by crossing their high will.
15 3762                            Exeunt. Manent Musicians [and Nurse].
15 3763   1. Mus. Faith, we may put up our pipes and be gone.
15 3764 
15 3765   Nurse. Honest good fellows, ah, put up, put up!
15 3766     For well you know this is a pitiful case.            [Exit.]
15 3767   1. Mus. Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.
15 3768 
15 3769                          Enter Peter.
15 3770 
15 3771 
15 3772   Pet. Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease,' 'Heart's ease'!
15 3773     O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'
15 3774   1. Mus. Why 'Heart's ease'',
15 3775 
15 3776   Pet. O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My heart is
15 3777     full of woe.' O, play me some merry dump to comfort me.
15 3778   1. Mus. Not a dump we! 'Tis no time to play now.
15 3779 
15 3780   Pet. You will not then?
15 3781   1. Mus. No.
15 3782 
15 3783   Pet. I will then give it you soundly.
15 3784   1. Mus. What will you give us?
15 3785 
15 3786   Pet. No money, on my faith, but the gleek. I will give you the
15 3787      minstrel.
15 3788   1. Mus. Then will I give you the serving-creature.
15 3789 
15 3790   Pet. Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on your pate.
15 3791     I will carry no crotchets. I'll re you, I'll fa you. Do you
15 3792     note me?
15 3793   1. Mus. An you re us and fa us, you note us.
15 3794   2. Mus. Pray you put up your dagger, and put out your wit.
15 3795 
15 3796   Pet. Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you with an
15 3797     iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer me like men.
15 3798 
15 3799            'When griping grief the heart doth wound,
15 3800              And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
15 3801            Then music with her silver sound'-
15 3802 
15 3803     Why 'silver sound'? Why 'music with her silver sound'?
15 3804     What say you, Simon Catling?
15 3805   1. Mus. Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.
15 3806 
15 3807   Pet. Pretty! What say You, Hugh Rebeck?
15 3808   2. Mus. I say 'silver sound' because musicians sound for silver.
15 3809 
15 3810   Pet. Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?
15 3811   3. Mus. Faith, I know not what to say.
15 3812 
15 3813   Pet. O, I cry you mercy! you are the singer. I will say for you. It
15 3814     is 'music with her silver sound' because musicians have no
15 3815     gold for sounding.

15 3817            'Then music with her silver sound
15 3818              With speedy help doth lend redress.'         [Exit.
15 3819 
15 3820   1. Mus. What a pestilent knave is this same?
15 3821   2. Mus. Hang him, Jack! Come, we'll in here, tarry for the
15 3822     mourners, and stay dinner.
15 3823                                                          Exeunt.

15 3828 ACT V. Scene I.
15 3829 Mantua. A street.
15 3830 
15 3831 Enter Romeo.
15 3832 
15 3833 
15 3834   Rom. If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep
15 3835     My dreams presage some joyful news at hand.
15 3836     My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne,
15 3837     And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
15 3838     Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
15 3839     I dreamt my lady came and found me dead
15 3840     (Strange dream that gives a dead man leave to think!)
15 3841     And breath'd such life with kisses in my lips
15 3842     That I reviv'd and was an emperor.
15 3843     Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
15 3844     When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
15 3845 
15 3846                 Enter Romeo's Man Balthasar, booted.
15 3847 
15 3848     News from Verona! How now, Balthasar?
15 3849     Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
15 3850     How doth my lady? Is my father well?
15 3851     How fares my Juliet? That I ask again,
15 3852     For nothing can be ill if she be well.
15 3853 
15 3854   Man. Then she is well, and nothing can be ill.
15 3855     Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
15 3856     And her immortal part with angels lives.
15 3857     I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault
15 3858     And presently took post to tell it you.
15 3859     O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
15 3860     Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
15 3861 
15 3862   Rom. Is it e'en so? Then I defy you, stars!
15 3863     Thou knowest my lodging. Get me ink and paper
15 3864     And hire posthorses. I will hence to-night.
15 3865 
15 3866   Man. I do beseech you, sir, have patience.
15 3867     Your looks are pale and wild and do import
15 3868     Some misadventure.
15 3869 
15 3870   Rom. Tush, thou art deceiv'd.
15 3871     Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do.
15 3872     Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?
15 3873 
15 3874   Man. No, my good lord.
15 3875 
15 3876   Rom. No matter. Get thee gone
15 3877     And hire those horses. I'll be with thee straight.
15 3878                                                Exit [Balthasar].
15 3879     Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
15 3880     Let's see for means. O mischief, thou art swift
15 3881     To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
15 3882     I do remember an apothecary,
15 3883     And hereabouts 'a dwells, which late I noted
15 3884     In tatt'red weeds, with overwhelming brows,
15 3885     Culling of simples. Meagre were his looks,
15 3886     Sharp misery had worn him to the bones;
15 3887     And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
15 3888     An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
15 3889     Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
15 3890     A beggarly account of empty boxes,
15 3891     Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,
15 3892     Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses
15 3893     Were thinly scattered, to make up a show.
15 3894     Noting this penury, to myself I said,
15 3895     'An if a man did need a poison now
15 3896     Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
15 3897     Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
15 3898     O, this same thought did but forerun my need,
15 3899     And this same needy man must sell it me.
15 3900     As I remember, this should be the house.
15 3901     Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut. What, ho! apothecary!
15 3902 
15 3903                         Enter Apothecary.
15 3904 
15 3905 
15 3906   Apoth. Who calls so loud?
15 3907 
15 3908   Rom. Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor.
15 3909     Hold, there is forty ducats. Let me have
15 3910     A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
15 3911     As will disperse itself through all the veins
15 3912     That the life-weary taker mall fall dead,
15 3913     And that the trunk may be discharg'd of breath
15 3914     As violently as hasty powder fir'd
15 3915     Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
15 3916 
15 3917   Apoth. Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
15 3918     Is death to any he that utters them.
15 3919 
15 3920   Rom. Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness
15 3921     And fearest to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,
15 3922     Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
15 3923     Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back:
15 3924     The world is not thy friend, nor the world's law;
15 3925     The world affords no law to make thee rich;
15 3926     Then be not poor, but break it and take this.
15 3927 
15 3928   Apoth. My poverty but not my will consents.
15 3929 
15 3930   Rom. I pay thy poverty and not thy will.
15 3931 
15 3932   Apoth. Put this in any liquid thing you will
15 3933     And drink it off, and if you had the strength
15 3934     Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.
15 3935 
15 3936   Rom. There is thy gold- worse poison to men's souls,
15 3937     Doing more murther in this loathsome world,
15 3938     Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
15 3939     I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
15 3940     Farewell. Buy food and get thyself in flesh.
15 3941     Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
15 3942     To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.
15 3943                                                          Exeunt.

15 3948 Scene II.
15 3949 Verona. Friar Laurence's cell.
15 3950 
15 3951 Enter Friar John to Friar Laurence.
15 3952 
15 3953 
15 3954   John. Holy Franciscan friar, brother, ho!
15 3955 
15 3956                       Enter Friar Laurence.
15 3957 
15 3958 
15 3959   Laur. This same should be the voice of Friar John.
15 3960     Welcome from Mantua. What says Romeo?
15 3961     Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.
15 3962 
15 3963   John. Going to find a barefoot brother out,
15 3964     One of our order, to associate me
15 3965     Here in this city visiting the sick,
15 3966     And finding him, the searchers of the town,
15 3967     Suspecting that we both were in a house
15 3968     Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
15 3969     Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth,
15 3970     So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.
15 3971 
15 3972   Laur. Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?
15 3973 
15 3974   John. I could not send it- here it is again-
15 3975     Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
15 3976     So fearful were they of infection.
15 3977 
15 3978   Laur. Unhappy fortune! By my brotherhood,
15 3979     The letter was not nice, but full of charge,
15 3980     Of dear import; and the neglecting it
15 3981     May do much danger. Friar John, go hence,
15 3982     Get me an iron crow and bring it straight
15 3983     Unto my cell.
15 3984 
15 3985   John. Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.                 Exit.
15 3986 
15 3987   Laur. Now, must I to the monument alone.
15 3988     Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake.
15 3989     She will beshrew me much that Romeo
15 3990     Hath had no notice of these accidents;
15 3991     But I will write again to Mantua,
15 3992     And keep her at my cell till Romeo come-
15 3993     Poor living corse, clos'd in a dead man's tomb!        Exit.
15 3994 
15 3995 
15 3996 
15 3997 
15 3998 Scene III.
15 3999 Verona. A churchyard; in it the monument of the Capulets.
15 4000 
15 4001 Enter Paris and his Page with flowers and [a torch].
15 4002 
15 4003 
15 4004   Par. Give me thy torch, boy. Hence, and stand aloof.
15 4005     Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
15 4006     Under yond yew tree lay thee all along,
15 4007     Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground.
15 4008     So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread
15 4009     (Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves)
15 4010     But thou shalt hear it. Whistle then to me,
15 4011     As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
15 4012     Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.
15 4013 
15 4014   Page. [aside] I am almost afraid to stand alone
15 4015     Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.     [Retires.]
15 4016 
15 4017   Par. Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew
15 4018     (O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones)
15 4019     Which with sweet water nightly I will dew;
15 4020     Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans.
15 4021     The obsequies that I for thee will keep
15 4022     Nightly shall be to strew, thy grave and weep.
15 4023                                                     Whistle Boy.
15 4024     The boy gives warning something doth approach.
15 4025     What cursed foot wanders this way to-night
15 4026     To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
15 4027     What, with a torch? Muffle me, night, awhile.     [Retires.]
15 4028 
15 4029        Enter Romeo, and Balthasar with a torch, a mattock,
15 4030                     and a crow of iron.
15 4031 
15 4032 
15 4033   Rom. Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
15 4034     Hold, take this letter. Early in the morning
15 4035     See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
15 4036     Give me the light. Upon thy life I charge thee,
15 4037     Whate'er thou hearest or seest, stand all aloof
15 4038     And do not interrupt me in my course.
15 4039     Why I descend into this bed of death
15 4040     Is partly to behold my lady's face,
15 4041     But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
15 4042     A precious ring- a ring that I must use
15 4043     In dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone.
15 4044     But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
15 4045     In what I farther shall intend to do,
15 4046     By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint
15 4047     And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.
15 4048     The time and my intents are savage-wild,
15 4049     More fierce and more inexorable far
15 4050     Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.
15 4051 
15 4052   Bal. I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
15 4053 
15 4054   Rom. So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that.
15 4055     Live, and be prosperous; and farewell, good fellow.
15 4056 
15 4057   Bal. [aside] For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout.
15 4058     His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.        [Retires.]
15 4059 
15 4060   Rom. Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
15 4061     Gorg'd with the dearest morsel of the earth,
15 4062     Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
15 4063     And in despite I'll cram thee with more food.
15 4064                                            Romeo opens the tomb.
15 4065 
15 4066   Par. This is that banish'd haughty Montague
15 4067     That murd'red my love's cousin- with which grief
15 4068     It is supposed the fair creature died-
15 4069     And here is come to do some villanous shame
15 4070     To the dead bodies. I will apprehend him.
15 4071     Stop thy unhallowed toil, vile Montague!
15 4072     Can vengeance be pursu'd further than death?
15 4073     Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee.
15 4074     Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.
15 4075 
15 4076   Rom. I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
15 4077     Good gentle youth, tempt not a desp'rate man.
15 4078     Fly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone;
15 4079     Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
15 4080     But not another sin upon my head
15 4081     By urging me to fury. O, be gone!
15 4082     By heaven, I love thee better than myself,
15 4083     For I come hither arm'd against myself.
15 4084     Stay not, be gone. Live, and hereafter say
15 4085     A madman's mercy bid thee run away.
15 4086 
15 4087   Par. I do defy thy, conjuration
15 4088     And apprehend thee for a felon here.
15 4089 
15 4090   Rom. Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy!
15 4091                                                      They fight.
15 4092 
15 4093   Page. O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.
15 4094                                             [Exit. Paris falls.]
15 4095 
15 4096   Par. O, I am slain! If thou be merciful,
15 4097     Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.                   [Dies.]
15 4098 
15 4099   Rom. In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
15 4100     Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
15 4101     What said my man when my betossed soul
15 4102     Did not attend him as we rode? I think
15 4103     He told me Paris should have married Juliet.
15 4104     Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
15 4105     Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet
15 4106     To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
15 4107     One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
15 4108     I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave.
15 4109     A grave? O, no, a lanthorn, slaught'red youth,
15 4110     For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
15 4111     This vault a feasting presence full of light.
15 4112     Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
15 4113                                          [Lays him in the tomb.]
15 4114     How oft when men are at the point of death
15 4115     Have they been merry! which their keepers call
15 4116     A lightning before death. O, how may I
15 4117     Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
15 4118     Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
15 4119     Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.
15 4120     Thou art not conquer'd. Beauty's ensign yet
15 4121     Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
15 4122     And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
15 4123     Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
15 4124     O, what more favour can I do to thee
15 4125     Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
15 4126     To sunder his that was thine enemy?
15 4127     Forgive me, cousin.' Ah, dear Juliet,
15 4128     Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe
15 4129     That unsubstantial Death is amorous,
15 4130     And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
15 4131     Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
15 4132     For fear of that I still will stay with thee
15 4133     And never from this palace of dim night
15 4134     Depart again. Here, here will I remain
15 4135     With worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here
15 4136     Will I set up my everlasting rest
15 4137     And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
15 4138     From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
15 4139     Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
15 4140     The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
15 4141     A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
15 4142     Come, bitter conduct; come, unsavoury guide!
15 4143     Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
15 4144     The dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark!
15 4145     Here's to my love! [Drinks.] O true apothecary!
15 4146     Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.          Falls.
15 4147 
15 4148     Enter Friar [Laurence], with lanthorn, crow, and spade.
15 4149 
15 4150 
15 4151   Friar. Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
15 4152     Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?
15 4153 
15 4154   Bal. Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
15 4155 
15 4156   Friar. Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
15 4157     What torch is yond that vainly lends his light
15 4158     To grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern,
15 4159     It burneth in the Capels' monument.
15 4160 
15 4161   Bal. It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
15 4162     One that you love.
15 4163 
15 4164   Friar. Who is it?
15 4165 
15 4166   Bal. Romeo.
15 4167 
15 4168   Friar. How long hath he been there?
15 4169 
15 4170   Bal. Full half an hour.
15 4171 
15 4172   Friar. Go with me to the vault.
15 4173 
15 4174   Bal. I dare not, sir.
15 4175     My master knows not but I am gone hence,
15 4176     And fearfully did menace me with death
15 4177     If I did stay to look on his intents.
15 4178 
15 4179   Friar. Stay then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me.
15 4180     O, much I fear some ill unthrifty thing.
15 4181 
15 4182   Bal. As I did sleep under this yew tree here,
15 4183     I dreamt my master and another fought,
15 4184     And that my master slew him.
15 4185 
15 4186   Friar. Romeo!
15 4187     Alack, alack, what blood is this which stains
15 4188     The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
15 4189     What mean these masterless and gory swords
15 4190     To lie discolour'd by this place of peace? [Enters the tomb.]
15 4191     Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?
15 4192     And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
15 4193     Is guilty of this lamentable chance! The lady stirs.
15 4194                                                    Juliet rises.
15 4195 
15 4196   Jul. O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
15 4197     I do remember well where I should be,
15 4198     And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
15 4199 
15 4200   Friar. I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
15 4201     Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.
15 4202     A greater power than we can contradict
15 4203     Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
15 4204     Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
15 4205     And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
15 4206     Among a sisterhood of holy nuns.
15 4207     Stay not to question, for the watch is coming.
15 4208     Come, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay.
15 4209 
15 4210   Jul. Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
15 4211                                                    Exit [Friar].
15 4212     What's here? A cup, clos'd in my true love's hand?
15 4213     Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.
15 4214     O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
15 4215     To help me after? I will kiss thy lips.
15 4216     Haply some poison yet doth hang on them
15 4217     To make me die with a restorative.             [Kisses him.]
15 4218     Thy lips are warm!
15 4219 
15 4220   Chief Watch. [within] Lead, boy. Which way?
15 4221     Yea, noise? Then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!
15 4222                                       [Snatches Romeo's dagger.]
15 4223     This is thy sheath; there rest, and let me die.
15 4224                   She stabs herself and falls [on Romeo's body].
15 4225 
15 4226                 Enter [Paris's] Boy and Watch.
15 4227 
15 4228 
15 4229   Boy. This is the place. There, where the torch doth burn.
15 4230 
15 4231   Chief Watch. 'the ground is bloody. Search about the churchyard.
15 4232     Go, some of you; whoe'er you find attach.
15 4233                                      [Exeunt some of the Watch.]
15 4234     Pitiful sight! here lies the County slain;
15 4235     And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
15 4236     Who here hath lain this two days buried.
15 4237     Go, tell the Prince; run to the Capulets;
15 4238     Raise up the Montagues; some others search.
15 4239                                    [Exeunt others of the Watch.]
15 4240     We see the ground whereon these woes do lie,
15 4241     But the true ground of all these piteous woes
15 4242     We cannot without circumstance descry.
15 4243 
15 4244      Enter [some of the Watch,] with Romeo's Man [Balthasar].
15 4245 
15 4246   2. Watch. Here's Romeo's man. We found him in the churchyard.
15 4247 
15 4248   Chief Watch. Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither.
15 4249 
15 4250           Enter Friar [Laurence] and another Watchman.
15 4251 
15 4252   3. Watch. Here is a friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps.
15 4253     We took this mattock and this spade from him
15 4254     As he was coming from this churchyard side.
15 4255 
15 4256   Chief Watch. A great suspicion! Stay the friar too.
15 4257 
15 4258               Enter the Prince [and Attendants].
15 4259 
15 4260 
15 4261   Prince. What misadventure is so early up,
15 4262     That calls our person from our morning rest?
15 4263 
15 4264             Enter Capulet and his Wife [with others].
15 4265 
15 4266 
15 4267   Cap. What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?
15 4268 
15 4269   Wife. The people in the street cry 'Romeo,'
15 4270     Some 'Juliet,' and some 'Paris'; and all run,
15 4271     With open outcry, toward our monument.
15 4272 
15 4273   Prince. What fear is this which startles in our ears?
15 4274 
15 4275   Chief Watch. Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
15 4276     And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
15 4277     Warm and new kill'd.
15 4278 
15 4279   Prince. Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.
15 4280 
15 4281   Chief Watch. Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man,
15 4282     With instruments upon them fit to open
15 4283     These dead men's tombs.
15 4284 
15 4285   Cap. O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
15 4286     This dagger hath mista'en, for, lo, his house
15 4287     Is empty on the back of Montague,
15 4288     And it missheathed in my daughter's bosom!
15 4289 
15 4290   Wife. O me! this sight of death is as a bell
15 4291     That warns my old age to a sepulchre.
15 4292 
15 4293                Enter Montague [and others].
15 4294 
15 4295 
15 4296   Prince. Come, Montague; for thou art early up
15 4297     To see thy son and heir more early down.
15 4298 
15 4299   Mon. Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night!
15 4300     Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath.
15 4301     What further woe conspires against mine age?
15 4302 
15 4303   Prince. Look, and thou shalt see.
15 4304 
15 4305   Mon. O thou untaught! what manners is in this,
15 4306     To press before thy father to a grave?
15 4307 
15 4308   Prince. Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
15 4309     Till we can clear these ambiguities
15 4310     And know their spring, their head, their true descent;
15 4311     And then will I be general of your woes
15 4312     And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,
15 4313     And let mischance be slave to patience.
15 4314     Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
15 4315 
15 4316   Friar. I am the greatest, able to do least,
15 4317     Yet most suspected, as the time and place
15 4318     Doth make against me, of this direful murther;
15 4319     And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
15 4320     Myself condemned and myself excus'd.
15 4321 
15 4322   Prince. Then say it once what thou dost know in this.
15 4323 
15 4324   Friar. I will be brief, for my short date of breath
15 4325     Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
15 4326     Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
15 4327     And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife.
15 4328     I married them; and their stol'n marriage day
15 4329     Was Tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death
15 4330     Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city;
15 4331     For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin'd.
15 4332     You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
15 4333     Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
15 4334     To County Paris. Then comes she to me
15 4335     And with wild looks bid me devise some mean
15 4336     To rid her from this second marriage,
15 4337     Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
15 4338     Then gave I her (so tutored by my art)
15 4339     A sleeping potion; which so took effect
15 4340     As I intended, for it wrought on her
15 4341     The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo
15 4342     That he should hither come as this dire night
15 4343     To help to take her from her borrowed grave,
15 4344     Being the time the potion's force should cease.
15 4345     But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
15 4346     Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
15 4347     Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
15 4348     At the prefixed hour of her waking
15 4349     Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
15 4350     Meaning to keep her closely at my cell
15 4351     Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.
15 4352     But when I came, some minute ere the time
15 4353     Of her awaking, here untimely lay
15 4354     The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
15 4355     She wakes; and I entreated her come forth
15 4356     And bear this work of heaven with patience;
15 4357     But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,
15 4358     And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
15 4359     But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
15 4360     All this I know, and to the marriage
15 4361     Her nurse is privy; and if aught in this
15 4362     Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
15 4363     Be sacrific'd, some hour before his time,
15 4364     Unto the rigour of severest law.
15 4365 
15 4366   Prince. We still have known thee for a holy man.
15 4367     Where's Romeo's man? What can he say in this?
15 4368 
15 4369   Bal. I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
15 4370     And then in post he came from Mantua
15 4371     To this same place, to this same monument.
15 4372     This letter he early bid me give his father,
15 4373     And threat'ned me with death, going in the vault,
15 4374     If I departed not and left him there.
15 4375 
15 4376   Prince. Give me the letter. I will look on it.
15 4377     Where is the County's page that rais'd the watch?
15 4378     Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
15 4379 
15 4380   Boy. He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
15 4381     And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.
15 4382     Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
15 4383     And by-and-by my master drew on him;
15 4384     And then I ran away to call the watch.
15 4385 
15 4386   Prince. This letter doth make good the friar's words,
15 4387     Their course of love, the tidings of her death;
15 4388     And here he writes that he did buy a poison
15 4389     Of a poor pothecary, and therewithal
15 4390     Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
15 4391     Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montage,
15 4392     See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
15 4393     That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!
15 4394     And I, for winking at you, discords too,
15 4395     Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish'd.
15 4396 
15 4397   Cap. O brother Montague, give me thy hand.
15 4398     This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
15 4399     Can I demand.
15 4400 
15 4401   Mon. But I can give thee more;
15 4402     For I will raise her Statue in pure gold,
15 4403     That whiles Verona by that name is known,
15 4404     There shall no figure at such rate be set
15 4405     As that of true and faithful Juliet.
15 4406 
15 4407   Cap. As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie-
15 4408     Poor sacrifices of our enmity!
15 4409 
15 4410   Prince. A glooming peace this morning with it brings.
15 4411     The sun for sorrow will not show his head.
15 4412     Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
15 4413     Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished;
15 4414     For never was a story of more woe
15 4415     Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
15 4416                                                    Exeunt omnes.

15 4685 Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
15 4686 
15 4687 Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
15 4688 electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
15 4689 including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
15 4690 because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
15 4691 people in all walks of life.
15 4692 
15 4693 Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
15 4694 assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
15 4695 goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
15 4696 remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
15 4697 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
15 4698 and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

15 4730 Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
15 4731 Literary Archive Foundation
15 4732 
15 4733 Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
15 4734 spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
15 4735 increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
15 4736 freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
15 4737 array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
15 4738 ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
15 4739 status with the IRS.
15 4740 
15 4741 The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
15 4742 charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
15 4743 States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
15 4744 considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
15 4745 with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
15 4746 where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
15 4747 SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
15 4748 particular state visit http://pglaf.org
15 4749 
15 4750 While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
15 4751 have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
15 4752 against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
15 4753 approach us with offers to donate.
15 4754 
15 4755 International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
15 4756 any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
15 4757 outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
15 4758 
15 4759 Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
15 4760 methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
15 4761 ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

15 4765 Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
15 4766 works.
15 4767 
15 4768 Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
15 4769 concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
15 4770 with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
15 4771 Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
15 4772 
15 4773 
15 4774 Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
15 4775 editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
15 4776 unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
15 4777 keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
