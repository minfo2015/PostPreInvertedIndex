7 52 ACT I. Scene I.
7 53 [King Lear's Palace.]
7 54 
7 55 Enter Kent, Gloucester, and Edmund. [Kent and Glouceste converse.
7 56 Edmund stands back.]
7 57 
7 58   Kent. I thought the King had more affected the Duke of Albany
7 59 than
7 60      Cornwall.
7 61   Glou. It did always seem so to us; but now, in the division of
7 62 the
7 63      kingdom, it appears not which of the Dukes he values most,
7 64 for
7 65      equalities are so weigh'd that curiosity in neither can make
7 66      choice of either's moiety.
7 67   Kent. Is not this your son, my lord?
7 68   Glou. His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge. I have so
7 69 often
7 70      blush'd to acknowledge him that now I am braz'd to't.
7 71   Kent. I cannot conceive you.
7 72   Glou. Sir, this young fellow's mother could; whereupon she grew
7 73      round-womb'd, and had indeed, sir, a son for her cradle ere
7 74 she
7 75      had a husband for her bed. Do you smell a fault?
7 76   Kent. I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it being so
7 77      proper.
7 78   Glou. But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some year elder
7 79 than
7 80      this, who yet is no dearer in my account. Though this knave
7 81 came
7 82      something saucily into the world before he was sent for, yet
7 83 was 
7 84      his mother fair, there was good sport at his making, and the
7 85      whoreson must be acknowledged.- Do you know this noble
7 86 gentleman,
7 87      Edmund?
7 88   Edm. [comes forward] No, my lord.
7 89   Glou. My Lord of Kent. Remember him hereafter as my honourable
7 90      friend.
7 91   Edm. My services to your lordship.
7 92   Kent. I must love you, and sue to know you better.
7 93   Edm. Sir, I shall study deserving.
7 94   Glou. He hath been out nine years, and away he shall again.
7 95                                                  Sound a sennet.
7 96      The King is coming.
7 97 
7 98       Enter one bearing a coronet; then Lear; then the Dukes of
7 99       Albany and Cornwall; next, Goneril, Regan, Cordelia, with
7 100                               Followers.
7 101 
7 102   Lear. Attend the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.
7 103   Glou. I shall, my liege.
7 104                                  Exeunt [Gloucester and Edmund].
7 105   Lear. Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.
7 106      Give me the map there. Know we have divided 
7 107      In three our kingdom; and 'tis our fast intent
7 108      To shake all cares and business from our age,
7 109      Conferring them on younger strengths while we
7 110      Unburthen'd crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,
7 111      And you, our no less loving son of Albany,
7 112      We have this hour a constant will to publish
7 113      Our daughters' several dowers, that future strife
7 114      May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,
7 115      Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love,
7 116      Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,
7 117      And here are to be answer'd. Tell me, my daughters
7 118      (Since now we will divest us both of rule,
7 119      Interest of territory, cares of state),
7 120      Which of you shall we say doth love us most?
7 121      That we our largest bounty may extend
7 122      Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,
7 123      Our eldest-born, speak first.
7 124   Gon. Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter;
7 125      Dearer than eyesight, space, and liberty;
7 126      Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare; 
7 127      No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;
7 128      As much as child e'er lov'd, or father found;
7 129      A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable.
7 130      Beyond all manner of so much I love you.
7 131   Cor. [aside] What shall Cordelia speak? Love, and be silent.
7 132   Lear. Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,
7 133      With shadowy forests and with champains rich'd,
7 134      With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,
7 135      We make thee lady. To thine and Albany's issue
7 136      Be this perpetual.- What says our second daughter,
7 137      Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? Speak.
7 138   Reg. Sir, I am made
7 139      Of the selfsame metal that my sister is,
7 140      And prize me at her worth. In my true heart
7 141      I find she names my very deed of love;
7 142      Only she comes too short, that I profess
7 143      Myself an enemy to all other joys
7 144      Which the most precious square of sense possesses,
7 145      And find I am alone felicitate
7 146      In your dear Highness' love. 
7 147   Cor. [aside] Then poor Cordelia!
7 148      And yet not so; since I am sure my love's
7 149      More richer than my tongue.
7 150   Lear. To thee and thine hereditary ever
7 151      Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom,
7 152      No less in space, validity, and pleasure
7 153      Than that conferr'd on Goneril.- Now, our joy,
7 154      Although the last, not least; to whose young love
7 155      The vines of France and milk of Burgundy
7 156      Strive to be interest; what can you say to draw
7 157      A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.
7 158   Cor. Nothing, my lord.
7 159   Lear. Nothing?
7 160   Cor. Nothing.
7 161   Lear. Nothing can come of nothing. Speak again.
7 162   Cor. Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave
7 163      My heart into my mouth. I love your Majesty
7 164      According to my bond; no more nor less.
7 165   Lear. How, how, Cordelia? Mend your speech a little,
7 166      Lest it may mar your fortunes. 
7 167   Cor. Good my lord,
7 168      You have begot me, bred me, lov'd me; I
7 169      Return those duties back as are right fit,
7 170      Obey you, love you, and most honour you.
7 171      Why have my sisters husbands, if they say
7 172      They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,
7 173      That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry
7 174      Half my love with him, half my care and duty.
7 175      Sure I shall never marry like my sisters,
7 176      To love my father all.
7 177   Lear. But goes thy heart with this?
7 178   Cor. Ay, good my lord.
7 179   Lear. So young, and so untender?
7 180   Cor. So young, my lord, and true.
7 181   Lear. Let it be so! thy truth then be thy dower!
7 182      For, by the sacred radiance of the sun,
7 183      The mysteries of Hecate and the night;
7 184      By all the operation of the orbs
7 185      From whom we do exist and cease to be;
7 186      Here I disclaim all my paternal care, 
7 187      Propinquity and property of blood,
7 188      And as a stranger to my heart and me
7 189      Hold thee from this for ever. The barbarous Scythian,
7 190      Or he that makes his generation messes
7 191      To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom
7 192      Be as well neighbour'd, pitied, and reliev'd,
7 193      As thou my sometime daughter.
7 194   Kent. Good my liege-
7 195   Lear. Peace, Kent!
7 196      Come not between the dragon and his wrath.
7 197      I lov'd her most, and thought to set my rest
7 198      On her kind nursery.- Hence and avoid my sight!-
7 199      So be my grave my peace as here I give
7 200      Her father's heart from her! Call France! Who stirs?
7 201      Call Burgundy! Cornwall and Albany,
7 202      With my two daughters' dowers digest this third;
7 203      Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.
7 204      I do invest you jointly in my power,
7 205      Preeminence, and all the large effects
7 206      That troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course, 
7 207      With reservation of an hundred knights,
7 208      By you to be sustain'd, shall our abode
7 209      Make with you by due turns. Only we still retain
7 210      The name, and all th' additions to a king. The sway,
7 211      Revenue, execution of the rest,
7 212      Beloved sons, be yours; which to confirm,
7 213      This coronet part betwixt you.
7 214   Kent. Royal Lear,
7 215      Whom I have ever honour'd as my king,
7 216      Lov'd as my father, as my master follow'd,
7 217      As my great patron thought on in my prayers-
7 218   Lear. The bow is bent and drawn; make from the shaft.
7 219   Kent. Let it fall rather, though the fork invade
7 220      The region of my heart! Be Kent unmannerly
7 221      When Lear is mad. What wouldst thou do, old man?
7 222      Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak
7 223      When power to flattery bows? To plainness honour's bound
7 224      When majesty falls to folly. Reverse thy doom;
7 225      And in thy best consideration check
7 226      This hideous rashness. Answer my life my judgment, 
7 227      Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least,
7 228      Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound
7 229      Reverbs no hollowness.
7 230   Lear. Kent, on thy life, no more!
7 231   Kent. My life I never held but as a pawn
7 232      To wage against thine enemies; nor fear to lose it,
7 233      Thy safety being the motive.
7 234   Lear. Out of my sight!
7 235   Kent. See better, Lear, and let me still remain
7 236      The true blank of thine eye.
7 237   Lear. Now by Apollo-
7 238   Kent. Now by Apollo, King,
7 239      Thou swear'st thy gods in vain.
7 240   Lear. O vassal! miscreant!
7 241                                    [Lays his hand on his sword.]
7 242   Alb., Corn. Dear sir, forbear!
7 243   Kent. Do!
7 244      Kill thy physician, and the fee bestow
7 245      Upon the foul disease. Revoke thy gift,
7 246      Or, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat, 
7 247      I'll tell thee thou dost evil.
7 248   Lear. Hear me, recreant!
7 249      On thine allegiance, hear me!
7 250      Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow-
7 251      Which we durst never yet- and with strain'd pride
7 252      To come between our sentence and our power,-
7 253      Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,-
7 254      Our potency made good, take thy reward.
7 255      Five days we do allot thee for provision
7 256      To shield thee from diseases of the world,
7 257      And on the sixth to turn thy hated back
7 258      Upon our kingdom. If, on the tenth day following,
7 259      Thy banish'd trunk be found in our dominions,
7 260      The moment is thy death. Away! By Jupiter,
7 261      This shall not be revok'd.
7 262   Kent. Fare thee well, King. Since thus thou wilt appear,
7 263      Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here.
7 264      [To Cordelia] The gods to their dear shelter take thee,
7 265 maid,
7 266      That justly think'st and hast most rightly said!
7 267      [To Regan and Goneril] And your large speeches may your
7 268 deeds 
7 269         approve,
7 270      That good effects may spring from words of love.
7 271      Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu;
7 272      He'll shape his old course in a country new.
7 273 Exit.
7 274 
7 275   Flourish. Enter Gloucester, with France and Burgundy;
7 276 Attendants.
7 277 
7 278   Glou. Here's France and Burgundy, my noble lord.
7 279   Lear. My Lord of Burgundy,
7 280      We first address toward you, who with this king
7 281      Hath rivall'd for our daughter. What in the least
7 282      Will you require in present dower with her,
7 283      Or cease your quest of love?
7 284   Bur. Most royal Majesty,
7 285      I crave no more than hath your Highness offer'd,
7 286      Nor will you tender less.
7 287   Lear. Right noble Burgundy,
7 288      When she was dear to us, we did hold her so;
7 289      But now her price is fall'n. Sir, there she stands.
7 290      If aught within that little seeming substance,
7 291      Or all of it, with our displeasure piec'd, 
7 292      And nothing more, may fitly like your Grace,
7 293      She's there, and she is yours.
7 294   Bur. I know no answer.
7 295   Lear. Will you, with those infirmities she owes,
7 296      Unfriended, new adopted to our hate,
7 297      Dow'r'd with our curse, and stranger'd with our oath,
7 298      Take her, or leave her?
7 299   Bur. Pardon me, royal sir.
7 300      Election makes not up on such conditions.
7 301   Lear. Then leave her, sir; for, by the pow'r that made me,
7 302      I tell you all her wealth. [To France] For you, great King,
7 303      I would not from your love make such a stray
7 304      To match you where I hate; therefore beseech you
7 305      T' avert your liking a more worthier way
7 306      Than on a wretch whom nature is asham'd
7 307      Almost t' acknowledge hers.
7 308   France. This is most strange,
7 309      That she that even but now was your best object,
7 310      The argument of your praise, balm of your age,
7 311      Most best, most dearest, should in this trice of time 
7 312      Commit a thing so monstrous to dismantle
7 313      So many folds of favour. Sure her offence
7 314      Must be of such unnatural degree
7 315      That monsters it, or your fore-vouch'd affection
7 316      Fall'n into taint; which to believe of her
7 317      Must be a faith that reason without miracle
7 318      Should never plant in me.
7 319   Cor. I yet beseech your Majesty,
7 320      If for I want that glib and oily art
7 321      To speak and purpose not, since what I well intend,
7 322      I'll do't before I speak- that you make known
7 323      It is no vicious blot, murther, or foulness,
7 324      No unchaste action or dishonoured step,
7 325      That hath depriv'd me of your grace and favour;
7 326      But even for want of that for which I am richer-
7 327      A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue
7 328      As I am glad I have not, though not to have it
7 329      Hath lost me in your liking.
7 330   Lear. Better thou
7 331      Hadst not been born than not t' have pleas'd me better. 
7 332   France. Is it but this- a tardiness in nature
7 333      Which often leaves the history unspoke
7 334      That it intends to do? My Lord of Burgundy,
7 335      What say you to the lady? Love's not love
7 336      When it is mingled with regards that stands
7 337      Aloof from th' entire point. Will you have her?
7 338      She is herself a dowry.
7 339   Bur. Royal Lear,
7 340      Give but that portion which yourself propos'd,
7 341      And here I take Cordelia by the hand,
7 342      Duchess of Burgundy.
7 343   Lear. Nothing! I have sworn; I am firm.
7 344   Bur. I am sorry then you have so lost a father
7 345      That you must lose a husband.
7 346   Cor. Peace be with Burgundy!
7 347      Since that respects of fortune are his love,
7 348      I shall not be his wife.
7 349   France. Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor;
7 350      Most choice, forsaken; and most lov'd, despis'd!
7 351      Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon. 
7 352      Be it lawful I take up what's cast away.
7 353      Gods, gods! 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglect
7 354      My love should kindle to inflam'd respect.
7 355      Thy dow'rless daughter, King, thrown to my chance,
7 356      Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France.
7 357      Not all the dukes in wat'rish Burgundy
7 358      Can buy this unpriz'd precious maid of me.
7 359      Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind.
7 360      Thou losest here, a better where to find.
7 361   Lear. Thou hast her, France; let her be thine; for we
7 362      Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see
7 363      That face of hers again. Therefore be gone
7 364      Without our grace, our love, our benison.
7 365      Come, noble Burgundy.
7 366              Flourish. Exeunt Lear, Burgundy, [Cornwall, Albany,
7 367                                     Gloucester, and Attendants].
7 368   France. Bid farewell to your sisters.
7 369   Cor. The jewels of our father, with wash'd eyes
7 370      Cordelia leaves you. I know you what you are;
7 371      And, like a sister, am most loath to call 
7 372      Your faults as they are nam'd. Use well our father.
7 373      To your professed bosoms I commit him;
7 374      But yet, alas, stood I within his grace,
7 375      I would prefer him to a better place!
7 376      So farewell to you both.
7 377   Gon. Prescribe not us our duties.
7 378   Reg. Let your study
7 379      Be to content your lord, who hath receiv'd you
7 380      At fortune's alms. You have obedience scanted,
7 381      And well are worth the want that you have wanted.
7 382   Cor. Time shall unfold what plighted cunning hides.
7 383      Who cover faults, at last shame them derides.
7 384      Well may you prosper!
7 385   France. Come, my fair Cordelia.
7 386                                      Exeunt France and Cordelia.
7 387   Gon. Sister, it is not little I have to say of what most nearly
7 388      appertains to us both. I think our father will hence
7 389 to-night.
7 390   Reg. That's most certain, and with you; next month with us.
7 391   Gon. You see how full of changes his age is. The observation we
7 392      have made of it hath not been little. He always lov'd our 
7 393      sister most, and with what poor judgment he hath now cast
7 394 her
7 395      off appears too grossly.
7 396   Reg. 'Tis the infirmity of his age; yet he hath ever but
7 397 slenderly
7 398      known himself.
7 399   Gon. The best and soundest of his time hath been but rash; then
7 400      must we look to receive from his age, not alone the
7 401      imperfections of long-ingraffed condition, but therewithal
7 402      the unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric years bring
7 403 with
7 404      them.
7 405   Reg. Such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as
7 406 this
7 407      of Kent's banishment.
7 408   Gon. There is further compliment of leave-taking between France
7 409 and
7 410      him. Pray you let's hit together. If our father carry
7 411 authority
7 412      with such dispositions as he bears, this last surrender of
7 413 his
7 414      will but offend us.
7 415   Reg. We shall further think on't.
7 416   Gon. We must do something, and i' th' heat.
7 417                                                          Exeunt.

7 422 Scene II.
7 423 The Earl of Gloucester's Castle.
7 424 
7 425 Enter [Edmund the] Bastard solus, [with a letter].
7 426 
7 427   Edm. Thou, Nature, art my goddess; to thy law
7 428      My services are bound. Wherefore should I
7 429      Stand in the plague of custom, and permit
7 430      The curiosity of nations to deprive me,
7 431      For that I am some twelve or fourteen moonshines
7 432      Lag of a brother? Why bastard? wherefore base?
7 433      When my dimensions are as well compact,
7 434      My mind as generous, and my shape as true,
7 435      As honest madam's issue? Why brand they us
7 436      With base? with baseness? bastardy? base, base?
7 437      Who, in the lusty stealth of nature, take
7 438      More composition and fierce quality
7 439      Than doth, within a dull, stale, tired bed,
7 440      Go to th' creating a whole tribe of fops
7 441      Got 'tween asleep and wake? Well then,
7 442      Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land.
7 443      Our father's love is to the bastard Edmund
7 444      As to th' legitimate. Fine word- 'legitimate'!
7 445      Well, my legitimate, if this letter speed, 
7 446      And my invention thrive, Edmund the base
7 447      Shall top th' legitimate. I grow; I prosper.
7 448      Now, gods, stand up for bastards!
7 449 
7 450                           Enter Gloucester.
7 451 
7 452   Glou. Kent banish'd thus? and France in choler parted?
7 453      And the King gone to-night? subscrib'd his pow'r?
7 454      Confin'd to exhibition? All this done
7 455      Upon the gad? Edmund, how now? What news?
7 456   Edm. So please your lordship, none.
7 457                                            [Puts up the letter.]
7 458   Glou. Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter?
7 459   Edm. I know no news, my lord.
7 460   Glou. What paper were you reading?
7 461   Edm. Nothing, my lord.
7 462   Glou. No? What needed then that terrible dispatch of it into
7 463 your
7 464      pocket? The quality of nothing hath not such need to hide
7 465      itself. Let's see. Come, if it be nothing, I shall not need
7 466      spectacles.
7 467   Edm. I beseech you, sir, pardon me. It is a letter from my
7 468 brother
7 469      that I have not all o'er-read; and for so much as I have 
7 470      perus'd, I find it not fit for your o'erlooking.
7 471   Glou. Give me the letter, sir.
7 472   Edm. I shall offend, either to detain or give it. The contents,
7 473 as
7 474      in part I understand them, are to blame.
7 475   Glou. Let's see, let's see!
7 476   Edm. I hope, for my brother's justification, he wrote this but
7 477 as
7 478      an essay or taste of my virtue.
7 479 
7 480   Glou. (reads) 'This policy and reverence of age makes the world
7 481      bitter to the best of our times; keeps our fortunes from us
7 482      till our oldness cannot relish them. I begin to find an idle
7 483      and fond bondage in the oppression of aged tyranny, who
7 484 sways,
7 485      not as it hath power, but as it is suffer'd. Come to me,
7 486 that
7 487      of this I may speak more. If our father would sleep till I
7 488      wak'd him, you should enjoy half his revenue for ever, and
7 489 live
7 490      the beloved of your brother,
7 491                                                         'EDGAR.'
7 492 
7 493      Hum! Conspiracy? 'Sleep till I wak'd him, you should enjoy
7 494 half
7 495      his revenue.' My son Edgar! Had he a hand to write this? a
7 496 heart
7 497      and brain to breed it in? When came this to you? Who brought
7 498 it?
7 499   Edm. It was not brought me, my lord: there's the cunning of it.
7 500 I 
7 501      found it thrown in at the casement of my closet.
7 502   Glou. You know the character to be your brother's?
7 503   Edm. If the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear it were
7 504 his;
7 505      but in respect of that, I would fain think it were not.
7 506   Glou. It is his.
7 507   Edm. It is his hand, my lord; but I hope his heart is not in
7 508 the
7 509      contents.
7 510   Glou. Hath he never before sounded you in this business?
7 511   Edm. Never, my lord. But I have heard him oft maintain it to be
7 512 fit
7 513      that, sons at perfect age, and fathers declining, the father
7 514      should be as ward to the son, and the son manage his
7 515 revenue.
7 516   Glou. O villain, villain! His very opinion in the letter!
7 517 Abhorred
7 518      villain! Unnatural, detested, brutish villain! worse than
7 519      brutish! Go, sirrah, seek him. I'll apprehend him.
7 520 Abominable
7 521      villain! Where is he?
7 522   Edm. I do not well know, my lord. If it shall please you to
7 523 suspend
7 524      your indignation against my brother till you can derive from
7 525 him
7 526      better testimony of his intent, you should run a certain
7 527 course;
7 528      where, if you violently proceed against him, mistaking his
7 529      purpose, it would make a great gap in your own honour and
7 530 shake 
7 531      in pieces the heart of his obedience. I dare pawn down my
7 532 life
7 533      for him that he hath writ this to feel my affection to your
7 534      honour, and to no other pretence of danger.
7 535   Glou. Think you so?
7 536   Edm. If your honour judge it meet, I will place you where you
7 537 shall
7 538      hear us confer of this and by an auricular assurance have
7 539 your
7 540      satisfaction, and that without any further delay than this
7 541 very
7 542      evening.
7 543   Glou. He cannot be such a monster.
7 544   Edm. Nor is not, sure.
7 545   Glou. To his father, that so tenderly and entirely loves him.
7 546      Heaven and earth! Edmund, seek him out; wind me into him, I
7 547 pray
7 548      you; frame the business after your own wisdom. I would
7 549 unstate
7 550      myself to be in a due resolution.
7 551   Edm. I will seek him, sir, presently; convey the business as I
7 552      shall find means, and acquaint you withal.
7 553   Glou. These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good
7 554 to
7 555      us. Though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus,
7 556 yet
7 557      nature finds itself scourg'd by the sequent effects. Love
7 558 cools,
7 559      friendship falls off, brothers divide. In cities, mutinies;
7 560 in 
7 561      countries, discord; in palaces, treason; and the bond
7 562 crack'd
7 563      'twixt son and father. This villain of mine comes under the
7 564      prediction; there's son against father: the King falls from
7 565 bias
7 566      of nature; there's father against child. We have seen the
7 567 best
7 568      of our time. Machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all
7 569      ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves. Find
7 570 out
7 571      this villain, Edmund; it shall lose thee nothing; do it
7 572      carefully. And the noble and true-hearted Kent banish'd! his
7 573      offence, honesty! 'Tis strange.                       Exit.
7 574   Edm. This is the excellent foppery of the world, that, when we
7 575 are
7 576      sick in fortune, often the surfeit of our own behaviour, we
7 577 make
7 578      guilty of our disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars; as
7 579 if
7 580      we were villains on necessity; fools by heavenly compulsion;
7 581      knaves, thieves, and treachers by spherical pre-dominance;
7 582      drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforc'd obedience of
7 583      planetary influence; and all that we are evil in, by a
7 584 divine
7 585      thrusting on. An admirable evasion of whore-master man, to
7 586 lay
7 587      his goatish disposition to the charge of a star! My father
7 588      compounded with my mother under the Dragon's Tail, and my
7 589      nativity was under Ursa Major, so that it follows I am rough
7 590 and 
7 591      lecherous. Fut! I should have been that I am, had the
7 592      maidenliest star in the firmament twinkled on my
7 593 bastardizing.
7 594      Edgar-
7 595 
7 596                              Enter Edgar.
7 597 
7 598      and pat! he comes, like the catastrophe of the old comedy.
7 599 My
7 600      cue is villainous melancholy, with a sigh like Tom o'
7 601 Bedlam.
7 602      O, these eclipses do portend these divisions! Fa, sol, la,
7 603 mi.
7 604   Edg. How now, brother Edmund? What serious contemplation are
7 605 you
7 606      in?
7 607   Edm. I am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read this other
7 608 day,
7 609      what should follow these eclipses.
7 610   Edg. Do you busy yourself with that?
7 611   Edm. I promise you, the effects he writes of succeed unhappily:
7 612 as
7 613      of unnaturalness between the child and the parent; death,
7 614      dearth, dissolutions of ancient amities; divisions in state,
7 615      menaces and maledictions against king and nobles; needless
7 616      diffidences, banishment of friends, dissipation of cohorts,
7 617      nuptial breaches, and I know not what.
7 618   Edg. How long have you been a sectary astronomical?
7 619   Edm. Come, come! When saw you my father last? 
7 620   Edg. The night gone by.
7 621   Edm. Spake you with him?
7 622   Edg. Ay, two hours together.
7 623   Edm. Parted you in good terms? Found you no displeasure in him
7 624 by
7 625      word or countenance
7 626   Edg. None at all.
7 627   Edm. Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended him; and at
7 628 my
7 629      entreaty forbear his presence until some little time hath
7 630      qualified the heat of his displeasure, which at this instant
7 631 so
7 632      rageth in him that with the mischief of your person it would
7 633      scarcely allay.
7 634   Edg. Some villain hath done me wrong.
7 635   Edm. That's my fear. I pray you have a continent forbearance
7 636 till
7 637      the speed of his rage goes slower; and, as I say, retire
7 638 with me
7 639      to my lodging, from whence I will fitly bring you to hear my
7 640      lord speak. Pray ye, go! There's my key. If you do stir
7 641 abroad,
7 642      go arm'd.
7 643   Edg. Arm'd, brother?
7 644   Edm. Brother, I advise you to the best. Go arm'd. I am no
7 645 honest man
7 646      if there be any good meaning toward you. I have told you
7 647 what I 
7 648      have seen and heard; but faintly, nothing like the image and
7 649      horror of it. Pray you, away!
7 650   Edg. Shall I hear from you anon?
7 651   Edm. I do serve you in this business.
7 652                                                      Exit Edgar.
7 653      A credulous father! and a brother noble,
7 654      Whose nature is so far from doing harms
7 655      That he suspects none; on whose foolish honesty
7 656      My practices ride easy! I see the business.
7 657      Let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit;
7 658      All with me's meet that I can fashion fit.
7 659 Exit.

7 664 Scene III.
7 665 The Duke of Albany's Palace.
7 666 
7 667 Enter Goneril and [her] Steward [Oswald].
7 668 
7 669   Gon. Did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fool?
7 670   Osw. Ay, madam.
7 671   Gon. By day and night, he wrongs me! Every hour
7 672      He flashes into one gross crime or other
7 673      That sets us all at odds. I'll not endure it.
7 674      His knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids us
7 675      On every trifle. When he returns from hunting,
7 676      I will not speak with him. Say I am sick.
7 677      If you come slack of former services,
7 678      You shall do well; the fault of it I'll answer.
7 679                                                  [Horns within.]
7 680   Osw. He's coming, madam; I hear him.
7 681   Gon. Put on what weary negligence you please,
7 682      You and your fellows. I'd have it come to question.
7 683      If he distaste it, let him to our sister,
7 684      Whose mind and mine I know in that are one,
7 685      Not to be overrul'd. Idle old man, 
7 686      That still would manage those authorities
7 687      That he hath given away! Now, by my life,
7 688      Old fools are babes again, and must be us'd
7 689      With checks as flatteries, when they are seen abus'd.
7 690      Remember what I have said.
7 691   Osw. Very well, madam.
7 692   Gon. And let his knights have colder looks among you.
7 693      What grows of it, no matter. Advise your fellows so.
7 694      I would breed from hence occasions, and I shall,
7 695      That I may speak. I'll write straight to my sister
7 696      To hold my very course. Prepare for dinner.
7 697                                                          Exeunt.

7 702 Scene IV.
7 703 The Duke of Albany's Palace.
7 704 
7 705 Enter Kent, [disguised].
7 706 
7 707   Kent. If but as well I other accents borrow,
7 708      That can my speech defuse, my good intent
7 709      May carry through itself to that full issue
7 710      For which I raz'd my likeness. Now, banish'd Kent,
7 711      If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemn'd,
7 712      So may it come, thy master, whom thou lov'st,
7 713      Shall find thee full of labours.
7 714 
7 715          Horns within. Enter Lear, [Knights,] and Attendants.
7 716 
7 717   Lear. Let me not stay a jot for dinner; go get it ready. [Exit
7 718      an Attendant.] How now? What art thou?
7 719   Kent. A man, sir.
7 720   Lear. What dost thou profess? What wouldst thou with us?
7 721   Kent. I do profess to be no less than I seem, to serve him
7 722 truly
7 723      that will put me in trust, to love him that is honest, to
7 724      converse with him that is wise and says little, to fear 
7 725      judgment, to fight when I cannot choose, and to eat no fish.
7 726   Lear. What art thou?
7 727   Kent. A very honest-hearted fellow, and as poor as the King.
7 728   Lear. If thou be'st as poor for a subject as he's for a king,
7 729 thou
7 730      art poor enough. What wouldst thou?
7 731   Kent. Service.
7 732   Lear. Who wouldst thou serve?
7 733   Kent. You.
7 734   Lear. Dost thou know me, fellow?
7 735   Kent. No, sir; but you have that in your countenance which I
7 736 would
7 737      fain call master.
7 738   Lear. What's that?
7 739   Kent. Authority.
7 740   Lear. What services canst thou do?
7 741   Kent. I can keep honest counsel, ride, run, mar a curious tale
7 742 in
7 743      telling it and deliver a plain message bluntly. That which
7 744      ordinary men are fit for, I am qualified in, and the best of
7 745 me
7 746      is diligence.
7 747   Lear. How old art thou?
7 748   Kent. Not so young, sir, to love a woman for singing, nor so
7 749 old to 
7 750      dote on her for anything. I have years on my back
7 751 forty-eight.
7 752   Lear. Follow me; thou shalt serve me. If I like thee no worse
7 753 after
7 754      dinner, I will not part from thee yet. Dinner, ho, dinner!
7 755      Where's my knave? my fool? Go you and call my fool hither.
7 756 
7 757                                             [Exit an attendant.]
7 758 
7 759                      Enter [Oswald the] Steward.
7 760 
7 761      You, you, sirrah, where's my daughter?
7 762   Osw. So please you-                                      Exit.
7 763   Lear. What says the fellow there? Call the clotpoll back.
7 764      [Exit a Knight.] Where's my fool, ho? I think the world's
7 765      asleep.
7 766 
7 767                             [Enter Knight]
7 768 
7 769      How now? Where's that mongrel?
7 770   Knight. He says, my lord, your daughter is not well.
7 771   Lear. Why came not the slave back to me when I call'd him? 
7 772   Knight. Sir, he answered me in the roundest manner, he would
7 773 not.
7 774   Lear. He would not?
7 775   Knight. My lord, I know not what the matter is; but to my
7 776 judgment
7 777      your Highness is not entertain'd with that ceremonious
7 778 affection
7 779      as you were wont. There's a great abatement of kindness
7 780 appears
7 781      as well in the general dependants as in the Duke himself
7 782 also
7 783      and your daughter.
7 784   Lear. Ha! say'st thou so?
7 785   Knight. I beseech you pardon me, my lord, if I be mistaken; for
7 786      my duty cannot be silent when I think your Highness wrong'd.
7 787   Lear. Thou but rememb'rest me of mine own conception. I have
7 788      perceived a most faint neglect of late, which I have rather
7 789      blamed as mine own jealous curiosity than as a very pretence
7 790      and purpose of unkindness. I will look further into't. But
7 791      where's my fool? I have not seen him this two days.
7 792   Knight. Since my young lady's going into France, sir, the fool
7 793      hath much pined away.
7 794   Lear. No more of that; I have noted it well. Go you and tell my
7 795      daughter I would speak with her. [Exit Knight.] Go you, call
7 796      hither my fool. 
7 797                                             [Exit an Attendant.]
7 798 
7 799                      Enter [Oswald the] Steward.
7 800 
7 801      O, you, sir, you! Come you hither, sir. Who am I, sir?
7 802   Osw. My lady's father.
7 803   Lear. 'My lady's father'? My lord's knave! You whoreson dog!
7 804 you
7 805      slave! you cur!
7 806   Osw. I am none of these, my lord; I beseech your pardon.
7 807   Lear. Do you bandy looks with me, you rascal?
7 808                                                   [Strikes him.]
7 809   Osw. I'll not be strucken, my lord.
7 810   Kent. Nor tripp'd neither, you base football player?
7 811                                             [Trips up his heels.
7 812   Lear. I thank thee, fellow. Thou serv'st me, and I'll love
7 813 thee.
7 814   Kent. Come, sir, arise, away! I'll teach you differences. Away,
7 815      away! If you will measure your lubber's length again, tarry;
7 816 but
7 817      away! Go to! Have you wisdom? So.
7 818                                                [Pushes him out.]
7 819   Lear. Now, my friendly knave, I thank thee. There's earnest of
7 820 thy 
7 821      service.                                     [Gives money.]
7 822 
7 823                              Enter Fool.
7 824 
7 825   Fool. Let me hire him too. Here's my coxcomb.
7 826                                           [Offers Kent his cap.]
7 827   Lear. How now, my pretty knave? How dost thou?
7 828   Fool. Sirrah, you were best take my coxcomb.
7 829   Kent. Why, fool?
7 830   Fool. Why? For taking one's part that's out of favour. Nay, an
7 831 thou
7 832      canst not smile as the wind sits, thou'lt catch cold
7 833 shortly.
7 834      There, take my coxcomb! Why, this fellow hath banish'd two
7 835 on's
7 836      daughters, and did the third a blessing against his will. If
7 837      thou follow him, thou must needs wear my coxcomb.- How now,
7 838      nuncle? Would I had two coxcombs and two daughters!
7 839   Lear. Why, my boy?
7 840   Fool. If I gave them all my living, I'ld keep my coxcombs
7 841 myself.
7 842      There's mine! beg another of thy daughters.
7 843   Lear. Take heed, sirrah- the whip.
7 844   Fool. Truth's a dog must to kennel; he must be whipp'd out,
7 845 when 
7 846      Lady the brach may stand by th' fire and stink.
7 847   Lear. A pestilent gall to me!
7 848   Fool. Sirrah, I'll teach thee a speech.
7 849   Lear. Do.
7 850   Fool. Mark it, nuncle.
7 851           Have more than thou showest,
7 852           Speak less than thou knowest,
7 853           Lend less than thou owest,
7 854           Ride more than thou goest,
7 855           Learn more than thou trowest,
7 856           Set less than thou throwest;
7 857           Leave thy drink and thy whore,
7 858           And keep in-a-door,
7 859           And thou shalt have more
7 860           Than two tens to a score.
7 861   Kent. This is nothing, fool.
7 862   Fool. Then 'tis like the breath of an unfeed lawyer- you gave
7 863 me
7 864      nothing for't. Can you make no use of nothing, nuncle?
7 865   Lear. Why, no, boy. Nothing can be made out of nothing.
7 866   Fool. [to Kent] Prithee tell him, so much the rent of his land 
7 867      comes to. He will not believe a fool.
7 868   Lear. A bitter fool!
7 869   Fool. Dost thou know the difference, my boy, between a bitter
7 870      fool and a sweet fool?
7 871   Lear. No, lad; teach me.
7 872   Fool.   That lord that counsell'd thee
7 873             To give away thy land,
7 874           Come place him here by me-
7 875             Do thou for him stand.
7 876           The sweet and bitter fool
7 877             Will presently appear;
7 878           The one in motley here,
7 879             The other found out there.
7 880   Lear. Dost thou call me fool, boy?
7 881   Fool. All thy other titles thou hast given away; that thou wast
7 882      born with.
7 883   Kent. This is not altogether fool, my lord.
7 884   Fool. No, faith; lords and great men will not let me. If I had
7 885 a
7 886      monopoly out, they would have part on't. And ladies too,
7 887 they
7 888      will not let me have all the fool to myself; they'll be 
7 889      snatching. Give me an egg, nuncle, and I'll give thee two
7 890      crowns.
7 891   Lear. What two crowns shall they be?
7 892   Fool. Why, after I have cut the egg i' th' middle and eat up
7 893 the
7 894      meat, the two crowns of the egg. When thou clovest thy crown
7 895 i'
7 896      th' middle and gav'st away both parts, thou bor'st thine ass
7 897 on
7 898      thy back o'er the dirt. Thou hadst little wit in thy bald
7 899 crown
7 900      when thou gav'st thy golden one away. If I speak like myself
7 901 in
7 902      this, let him be whipp'd that first finds it so.
7 903 
7 904      [Sings]    Fools had ne'er less grace in a year,
7 905                   For wise men are grown foppish;
7 906                 They know not how their wits to wear,
7 907                   Their manners are so apish.
7 908 
7 909   Lear. When were you wont to be so full of songs, sirrah?
7 910   Fool. I have us'd it, nuncle, ever since thou mad'st thy
7 911 daughters
7 912      thy mother; for when thou gav'st them the rod, and put'st
7 913 down
7 914      thine own breeches,
7 915  
7 916      [Sings]    Then they for sudden joy did weep,
7 917                   And I for sorrow sung,
7 918                 That such a king should play bo-peep
7 919                   And go the fools among.
7 920 
7 921      Prithee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teach thy fool
7 922 to
7 923      lie. I would fain learn to lie.
7 924   Lear. An you lie, sirrah, we'll have you whipp'd.
7 925   Fool. I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are. They'll
7 926 have me
7 927      whipp'd for speaking true; thou'lt have me whipp'd for
7 928 lying;
7 929      and sometimes I am whipp'd for holding my peace. I had
7 930 rather be
7 931      any kind o' thing than a fool! And yet I would not be thee,
7 932      nuncle. Thou hast pared thy wit o' both sides and left
7 933 nothing
7 934      i' th' middle. Here comes one o' the parings.
7 935 
7 936                             Enter Goneril.
7 937 
7 938   Lear. How now, daughter? What makes that frontlet on? Methinks
7 939 you
7 940      are too much o' late i' th' frown.
7 941   Fool. Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need to care
7 942 for 
7 943      her frowning. Now thou art an O without a figure. I am
7 944 better
7 945      than thou art now: I am a fool, thou art nothing.
7 946      [To Goneril] Yes, forsooth, I will hold my tongue. So your
7 947 face
7 948      bids me, though you say nothing. Mum, mum!
7 949 
7 950             He that keeps nor crust nor crum,
7 951             Weary of all, shall want some.-
7 952 
7 953      [Points at Lear] That's a sheal'd peascod.
7 954   Gon. Not only, sir, this your all-licens'd fool,
7 955      But other of your insolent retinue
7 956      Do hourly carp and quarrel, breaking forth
7 957      In rank and not-to-be-endured riots. Sir,
7 958      I had thought, by making this well known unto you,
7 959      To have found a safe redress, but now grow fearful,
7 960      By what yourself, too, late have spoke and done,
7 961      That you protect this course, and put it on
7 962      By your allowance; which if you should, the fault
7 963      Would not scape censure, nor the redresses sleep,
7 964      Which, in the tender of a wholesome weal, 
7 965      Might in their working do you that offence
7 966      Which else were shame, that then necessity
7 967      Must call discreet proceeding.
7 968   Fool. For you know, nuncle,
7 969 
7 970           The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long
7 971           That it had it head bit off by it young.
7 972 
7 973      So out went the candle, and we were left darkling.
7 974   Lear. Are you our daughter?
7 975   Gon. Come, sir,
7 976      I would you would make use of that good wisdom
7 977      Whereof I know you are fraught, and put away
7 978      These dispositions that of late transform you
7 979      From what you rightly are.
7 980   Fool. May not an ass know when the cart draws the horse?
7 981      Whoop, Jug, I love thee!
7 982   Lear. Doth any here know me? This is not Lear.
7 983      Doth Lear walk thus? speak thus? Where are his eyes?
7 984      Either his notion weakens, his discernings 
7 985      Are lethargied- Ha! waking? 'Tis not so!
7 986      Who is it that can tell me who I am?
7 987   Fool. Lear's shadow.
7 988   Lear. I would learn that; for, by the marks of sovereignty,
7 989      Knowledge, and reason, I should be false persuaded
7 990      I had daughters.
7 991   Fool. Which they will make an obedient father.
7 992   Lear. Your name, fair gentlewoman?
7 993   Gon. This admiration, sir, is much o' th' savour
7 994      Of other your new pranks. I do beseech you
7 995      To understand my purposes aright.
7 996      As you are old and reverend, you should be wise.
7 997      Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires;
7 998      Men so disorder'd, so debosh'd, and bold
7 999      That this our court, infected with their manners,
7 1000      Shows like a riotous inn. Epicurism and lust
7 1001      Make it more like a tavern or a brothel
7 1002      Than a grac'd palace. The shame itself doth speak
7 1003      For instant remedy. Be then desir'd
7 1004      By her that else will take the thing she begs 
7 1005      A little to disquantity your train,
7 1006      And the remainder that shall still depend
7 1007      To be such men as may besort your age,
7 1008      Which know themselves, and you.
7 1009   Lear. Darkness and devils!
7 1010      Saddle my horses! Call my train together!
7 1011      Degenerate bastard, I'll not trouble thee;
7 1012      Yet have I left a daughter.
7 1013   Gon. You strike my people, and your disorder'd rabble
7 1014      Make servants of their betters.
7 1015 
7 1016                             Enter Albany.
7 1017 
7 1018   Lear. Woe that too late repents!- O, sir, are you come?
7 1019      Is it your will? Speak, sir!- Prepare my horses.
7 1020      Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend,
7 1021      More hideous when thou show'st thee in a child
7 1022      Than the sea-monster!
7 1023   Alb. Pray, sir, be patient.
7 1024   Lear. [to Goneril] Detested kite, thou liest! 
7 1025      My train are men of choice and rarest parts,
7 1026      That all particulars of duty know
7 1027      And in the most exact regard support
7 1028      The worships of their name.- O most small fault,
7 1029      How ugly didst thou in Cordelia show!
7 1030      Which, like an engine, wrench'd my frame of nature
7 1031      From the fix'd place; drew from my heart all love
7 1032      And added to the gall. O Lear, Lear, Lear!
7 1033      Beat at this gate that let thy folly in  [Strikes his head.]
7 1034      And thy dear judgment out! Go, go, my people.
7 1035   Alb. My lord, I am guiltless, as I am ignorant
7 1036      Of what hath mov'd you.
7 1037   Lear. It may be so, my lord.
7 1038      Hear, Nature, hear! dear goddess, hear!
7 1039      Suspend thy purpose, if thou didst intend
7 1040      To make this creature fruitful.
7 1041      Into her womb convey sterility;
7 1042      Dry up in her the organs of increase;
7 1043      And from her derogate body never spring
7 1044      A babe to honour her! If she must teem, 
7 1045      Create her child of spleen, that it may live
7 1046      And be a thwart disnatur'd torment to her.
7 1047      Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth,
7 1048      With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks,
7 1049      Turn all her mother's pains and benefits
7 1050      To laughter and contempt, that she may feel
7 1051      How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is
7 1052      To have a thankless child! Away, away!                Exit.
7 1053   Alb. Now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this?
7 1054   Gon. Never afflict yourself to know the cause;
7 1055      But let his disposition have that scope
7 1056      That dotage gives it.
7 1057 
7 1058                              Enter Lear.
7 1059 
7 1060   Lear. What, fifty of my followers at a clap?
7 1061      Within a fortnight?
7 1062   Alb. What's the matter, sir?
7 1063   Lear. I'll tell thee. [To Goneril] Life and death! I am asham'd
7 1064      That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus; 
7 1065      That these hot tears, which break from me perforce,
7 1066      Should make thee worth them. Blasts and fogs upon thee!
7 1067      Th' untented woundings of a father's curse
7 1068      Pierce every sense about thee!- Old fond eyes,
7 1069      Beweep this cause again, I'll pluck ye out,
7 1070      And cast you, with the waters that you lose,
7 1071      To temper clay. Yea, is it come to this?
7 1072      Let it be so. Yet have I left a daughter,
7 1073      Who I am sure is kind and comfortable.
7 1074      When she shall hear this of thee, with her nails
7 1075      She'll flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt find
7 1076      That I'll resume the shape which thou dost think
7 1077      I have cast off for ever; thou shalt, I warrant thee.
7 1078                             Exeunt [Lear, Kent, and Attendants].
7 1079   Gon. Do you mark that, my lord?
7 1080   Alb. I cannot be so partial, Goneril,
7 1081      To the great love I bear you -
7 1082   Gon. Pray you, content.- What, Oswald, ho!
7 1083      [To the Fool] You, sir, more knave than fool, after your
7 1084 master!
7 1085   Fool. Nuncle Lear, nuncle Lear, tarry! Take the fool with thee.
7 1086 
7 1087 
7 1088           A fox when one has caught her,
7 1089           And such a daughter,
7 1090           Should sure to the slaughter,
7 1091           If my cap would buy a halter.
7 1092           So the fool follows after.                       Exit.
7 1093   Gon. This man hath had good counsel! A hundred knights?
7 1094      'Tis politic and safe to let him keep
7 1095      At point a hundred knights; yes, that on every dream,
7 1096      Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,
7 1097      He may enguard his dotage with their pow'rs
7 1098      And hold our lives in mercy.- Oswald, I say!
7 1099   Alb. Well, you may fear too far.
7 1100   Gon. Safer than trust too far.
7 1101      Let me still take away the harms I fear,
7 1102      Not fear still to be taken. I know his heart.
7 1103      What he hath utter'd I have writ my sister.
7 1104      If she sustain him and his hundred knights,
7 1105      When I have show'd th' unfitness-
7 1106  
7 1107                      Enter [Oswald the] Steward.
7 1108 
7 1109      How now, Oswald?
7 1110      What, have you writ that letter to my sister?
7 1111   Osw. Yes, madam.
7 1112   Gon. Take you some company, and away to horse!
7 1113      Inform her full of my particular fear,
7 1114      And thereto add such reasons of your own
7 1115      As may compact it more. Get you gone,
7 1116      And hasten your return. [Exit Oswald.] No, no, my lord!
7 1117      This milky gentleness and course of yours,
7 1118      Though I condemn it not, yet, under pardon,
7 1119      You are much more at task for want of wisdom
7 1120      Than prais'd for harmful mildness.
7 1121   Alb. How far your eyes may pierce I cannot tell.
7 1122      Striving to better, oft we mar what's well.
7 1123   Gon. Nay then-
7 1124   Alb. Well, well; th' event.                            Exeunt.
7 1125

7 1132 Enter Lear, Kent, and Fool.
7 1133 
7 1134   Lear. Go you before to Gloucester with these letters. Acquaint
7 1135 my
7 1136      daughter no further with anything you know than comes from
7 1137 her
7 1138      demand out of the letter. If your diligence be not speedy, I
7 1139      shall be there afore you.
7 1140   Kent. I will not sleep, my lord, till I have delivered your
7 1141 letter.
7 1142 Exit.
7 1143   Fool. If a man's brains were in's heels, were't not in danger
7 1144 of
7 1145      kibes?
7 1146   Lear. Ay, boy.
7 1147   Fool. Then I prithee be merry. Thy wit shall ne'er go
7 1148 slip-shod.
7 1149   Lear. Ha, ha, ha!
7 1150   Fool. Shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly; for
7 1151 though
7 1152      she's as like this as a crab's like an apple, yet I can tell
7 1153      what I can tell.
7 1154   Lear. What canst tell, boy?
7 1155   Fool. She'll taste as like this as a crab does to a crab. Thou
7 1156      canst tell why one's nose stands i' th' middle on's face? 
7 1157   Lear. No.
7 1158   Fool. Why, to keep one's eyes of either side's nose, that what
7 1159 a
7 1160      man cannot smell out, 'a may spy into.
7 1161   Lear. I did her wrong.
7 1162   Fool. Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell?
7 1163   Lear. No.
7 1164   Fool. Nor I neither; but I can tell why a snail has a house.
7 1165   Lear. Why?
7 1166   Fool. Why, to put's head in; not to give it away to his
7 1167 daughters,
7 1168      and leave his horns without a case.
7 1169   Lear. I will forget my nature. So kind a father!- Be my horses
7 1170      ready?
7 1171   Fool. Thy asses are gone about 'em. The reason why the seven
7 1172 stars
7 1173      are no moe than seven is a pretty reason.
7 1174   Lear. Because they are not eight?
7 1175   Fool. Yes indeed. Thou wouldst make a good fool.
7 1176   Lear. To tak't again perforce! Monster ingratitude!
7 1177   Fool. If thou wert my fool, nuncle, I'ld have thee beaten for
7 1178 being
7 1179      old before thy time.
7 1180   Lear. How's that? 
7 1181   Fool. Thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst been
7 1182 wise.
7 1183   Lear. O, let me not be mad, not mad, sweet heaven!
7 1184      Keep me in temper; I would not be mad!
7 1185 
7 1186                          [Enter a Gentleman.]
7 1187 
7 1188      How now? Are the horses ready?
7 1189   Gent. Ready, my lord.
7 1190   Lear. Come, boy.
7 1191   Fool. She that's a maid now, and laughs at my departure,
7 1192      Shall not be a maid long, unless things be cut shorter
7 1193                                                          Exeunt.

7 1209 ACT II. Scene I.
7 1210 A court within the Castle of the Earl of Gloucester.
7 1211 
7 1212 Enter [Edmund the] Bastard and Curan, meeting.
7 1213 
7 1214   Edm. Save thee, Curan.
7 1215   Cur. And you, sir. I have been with your father, and given him
7 1216      notice that the Duke of Cornwall and Regan his Duchess will
7 1217 be
7 1218      here with him this night.
7 1219   Edm. How comes that?
7 1220   Cur. Nay, I know not. You have heard of the news abroad- I mean
7 1221 the
7 1222      whisper'd ones, for they are yet but ear-kissing arguments?
7 1223   Edm. Not I. Pray you, what are they?
7 1224   Cur. Have you heard of no likely wars toward 'twixt the two
7 1225 Dukes
7 1226      of Cornwall and Albany?
7 1227   Edm. Not a word.
7 1228   Cur. You may do, then, in time. Fare you well, sir.      Exit.
7 1229   Edm. The Duke be here to-night? The better! best!
7 1230      This weaves itself perforce into my business.
7 1231      My father hath set guard to take my brother;
7 1232      And I have one thing, of a queasy question,
7 1233      Which I must act. Briefness and fortune, work! 
7 1234      Brother, a word! Descend! Brother, I say!
7 1235 
7 1236                              Enter Edgar.
7 1237 
7 1238      My father watches. O sir, fly this place!
7 1239      Intelligence is given where you are hid.
7 1240      You have now the good advantage of the night.
7 1241      Have you not spoken 'gainst the Duke of Cornwall?
7 1242      He's coming hither; now, i' th' night, i' th' haste,
7 1243      And Regan with him. Have you nothing said
7 1244      Upon his party 'gainst the Duke of Albany?
7 1245      Advise yourself.
7 1246   Edg. I am sure on't, not a word.
7 1247   Edm. I hear my father coming. Pardon me!
7 1248      In cunning I must draw my sword upon you.
7 1249      Draw, seem to defend yourself; now quit you well.-
7 1250      Yield! Come before my father. Light, ho, here!
7 1251      Fly, brother.- Torches, torches!- So farewell.
7 1252                                                      Exit Edgar.
7 1253      Some blood drawn on me would beget opinion 
7 1254      Of my more fierce endeavour. [Stabs his arm.] I have seen
7 1255         drunkards
7 1256      Do more than this in sport.- Father, father!-
7 1257      Stop, stop! No help?
7 1258 
7 1259              Enter Gloucester, and Servants with torches.
7 1260 
7 1261   Glou. Now, Edmund, where's the villain?
7 1262   Edm. Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out,
7 1263      Mumbling of wicked charms, conjuring the moon
7 1264      To stand 's auspicious mistress.
7 1265   Glou. But where is he?
7 1266   Edm. Look, sir, I bleed.
7 1267   Glou. Where is the villain, Edmund?
7 1268   Edm. Fled this way, sir. When by no means he could-
7 1269   Glou. Pursue him, ho! Go after.        [Exeunt some Servants].
7 1270      By no means what?
7 1271   Edm. Persuade me to the murther of your lordship;
7 1272      But that I told him the revenging gods
7 1273      'Gainst parricides did all their thunders bend; 
7 1274      Spoke with how manifold and strong a bond
7 1275      The child was bound to th' father- sir, in fine,
7 1276      Seeing how loathly opposite I stood
7 1277      To his unnatural purpose, in fell motion
7 1278      With his prepared sword he charges home
7 1279      My unprovided body, lanch'd mine arm;
7 1280      But when he saw my best alarum'd spirits,
7 1281      Bold in the quarrel's right, rous'd to th' encounter,
7 1282      Or whether gasted by the noise I made,
7 1283      Full suddenly he fled.
7 1284   Glou. Let him fly far.
7 1285      Not in this land shall he remain uncaught;
7 1286      And found- dispatch. The noble Duke my master,
7 1287      My worthy arch and patron, comes to-night.
7 1288      By his authority I will proclaim it
7 1289      That he which find, him shall deserve our thanks,
7 1290      Bringing the murderous caitiff to the stake;
7 1291      He that conceals him, death.
7 1292   Edm. When I dissuaded him from his intent
7 1293      And found him pight to do it, with curst speech 
7 1294      I threaten'd to discover him. He replied,
7 1295      'Thou unpossessing bastard, dost thou think,
7 1296      If I would stand against thee, would the reposal
7 1297      Of any trust, virtue, or worth in thee
7 1298      Make thy words faith'd? No. What I should deny
7 1299      (As this I would; ay, though thou didst produce
7 1300      My very character), I'ld turn it all
7 1301      To thy suggestion, plot, and damned practice;
7 1302      And thou must make a dullard of the world,
7 1303      If they not thought the profits of my death
7 1304      Were very pregnant and potential spurs
7 1305      To make thee seek it.'
7 1306   Glou. Strong and fast'ned villain!
7 1307      Would he deny his letter? I never got him.
7 1308                                                   Tucket within.
7 1309      Hark, the Duke's trumpets! I know not why he comes.
7 1310      All ports I'll bar; the villain shall not scape;
7 1311      The Duke must grant me that. Besides, his picture
7 1312      I will send far and near, that all the kingdom
7 1313      May have due note of him, and of my land, 
7 1314      Loyal and natural boy, I'll work the means
7 1315      To make thee capable.
7 1316 
7 1317                 Enter Cornwall, Regan, and Attendants.
7 1318 
7 1319   Corn. How now, my noble friend? Since I came hither
7 1320      (Which I can call but now) I have heard strange news.
7 1321   Reg. If it be true, all vengeance comes too short
7 1322      Which can pursue th' offender. How dost, my lord?
7 1323   Glou. O madam, my old heart is crack'd, it's crack'd!
7 1324   Reg. What, did my father's godson seek your life?
7 1325      He whom my father nam'd? Your Edgar?
7 1326   Glou. O lady, lady, shame would have it hid!
7 1327   Reg. Was he not companion with the riotous knights
7 1328      That tend upon my father?
7 1329   Glou. I know not, madam. 'Tis too bad, too bad!
7 1330   Edm. Yes, madam, he was of that consort.
7 1331   Reg. No marvel then though he were ill affected.
7 1332      'Tis they have put him on the old man's death,
7 1333      To have th' expense and waste of his revenues. 
7 1334      I have this present evening from my sister
7 1335      Been well inform'd of them, and with such cautions
7 1336      That, if they come to sojourn at my house,
7 1337      I'll not be there.
7 1338   Corn. Nor I, assure thee, Regan.
7 1339      Edmund, I hear that you have shown your father
7 1340      A childlike office.
7 1341   Edm. 'Twas my duty, sir.
7 1342   Glou. He did bewray his practice, and receiv'd
7 1343      This hurt you see, striving to apprehend him.
7 1344   Corn. Is he pursued?
7 1345   Glou. Ay, my good lord.
7 1346   Corn. If he be taken, he shall never more
7 1347      Be fear'd of doing harm. Make your own purpose,
7 1348      How in my strength you please. For you, Edmund,
7 1349      Whose virtue and obedience doth this instant
7 1350      So much commend itself, you shall be ours.
7 1351      Natures of such deep trust we shall much need;
7 1352      You we first seize on.
7 1353   Edm. I shall serve you, sir, 
7 1354      Truly, however else.
7 1355   Glou. For him I thank your Grace.
7 1356   Corn. You know not why we came to visit you-
7 1357   Reg. Thus out of season, threading dark-ey'd night.
7 1358      Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise,
7 1359      Wherein we must have use of your advice.
7 1360      Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister,
7 1361      Of differences, which I best thought it fit
7 1362      To answer from our home. The several messengers
7 1363      From hence attend dispatch. Our good old friend,
7 1364      Lay comforts to your bosom, and bestow
7 1365      Your needful counsel to our business,
7 1366      Which craves the instant use.
7 1367   Glou. I serve you, madam.
7 1368      Your Graces are right welcome.
7 1369                                                Exeunt. Flourish.

7 1374 Scene II.
7 1375 Before Gloucester's Castle.
7 1376 
7 1377 Enter Kent and [Oswald the] Steward, severally.
7 1378 
7 1379   Osw. Good dawning to thee, friend. Art of this house?
7 1380   Kent. Ay.
7 1381   Osw. Where may we set our horses?
7 1382   Kent. I' th' mire.
7 1383   Osw. Prithee, if thou lov'st me, tell me.
7 1384   Kent. I love thee not.
7 1385   Osw. Why then, I care not for thee.
7 1386   Kent. If I had thee in Lipsbury Pinfold, I would make thee care
7 1387 for
7 1388      me.
7 1389   Osw. Why dost thou use me thus? I know thee not.
7 1390   Kent. Fellow, I know thee.
7 1391   Osw. What dost thou know me for?
7 1392   Kent. A knave; a rascal; an eater of broken meats; a base,
7 1393 proud,
7 1394      shallow, beggarly, three-suited, hundred-pound, filthy,
7 1395      worsted-stocking knave; a lily-liver'd, action-taking,
7 1396 whoreson,
7 1397      glass-gazing, superserviceable, finical rogue;
7 1398      one-trunk-inheriting slave; one that wouldst be a bawd in
7 1399 way of
7 1400      good service, and art nothing but the composition of a
7 1401 knave, 
7 1402      beggar, coward, pander, and the son and heir of a mongrel
7 1403 bitch;
7 1404      one whom I will beat into clamorous whining, if thou deny
7 1405 the
7 1406      least syllable of thy addition.
7 1407   Osw. Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou, thus to rail on one
7 1408      that's neither known of thee nor knows thee!
7 1409   Kent. What a brazen-fac'd varlet art thou, to deny thou knowest
7 1410 me!
7 1411      Is it two days ago since I beat thee and tripp'd up thy
7 1412 heels
7 1413      before the King? [Draws his sword.] Draw, you rogue! for,
7 1414 though
7 1415      it be night, yet the moon shines. I'll make a sop o' th'
7 1416      moonshine o' you. Draw, you whoreson cullionly barbermonger!
7 1417      draw!
7 1418   Osw. Away! I have nothing to do with thee.
7 1419   Kent. Draw, you rascal! You come with letters against the King,
7 1420 and
7 1421      take Vanity the puppet's part against the royalty of her
7 1422 father.
7 1423      Draw, you rogue, or I'll so carbonado your shanks! Draw, you
7 1424      rascal! Come your ways!
7 1425   Osw. Help, ho! murther! help!
7 1426   Kent. Strike, you slave! Stand, rogue! Stand, you neat slave!
7 1427      Strike!                                        [Beats him.] 
7 1428   Osw. Help, ho! murther! murther!
7 1429 
7 1430       Enter Edmund, with his rapier drawn, Gloucester, Cornwall,
7 1431                            Regan, Servants.
7 1432 
7 1433   Edm. How now? What's the matter?                 Parts [them].
7 1434   Kent. With you, goodman boy, an you please! Come, I'll flesh
7 1435 ye!
7 1436      Come on, young master!
7 1437   Glou. Weapons? arms? What's the matter here?
7 1438   Corn. Keep peace, upon your lives!
7 1439      He dies that strikes again. What is the matter?
7 1440   Reg. The messengers from our sister and the King
7 1441   Corn. What is your difference? Speak.
7 1442   Osw. I am scarce in breath, my lord.
7 1443   Kent. No marvel, you have so bestirr'd your valour. You
7 1444 cowardly
7 1445      rascal, nature disclaims in thee; a tailor made thee.
7 1446   Corn. Thou art a strange fellow. A tailor make a man?
7 1447   Kent. Ay, a tailor, sir. A stonecutter or a painter could not
7 1448 have
7 1449      made him so ill, though he had been but two hours at the
7 1450 trade.
7 1451   Corn. Speak yet, how grew your quarrel? 
7 1452   Osw. This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have spar'd
7 1453      At suit of his grey beard-
7 1454   Kent. Thou whoreson zed! thou unnecessary letter! My lord, if
7 1455      you'll give me leave, I will tread this unbolted villain
7 1456 into
7 1457      mortar and daub the walls of a jakes with him. 'Spare my
7 1458 grey
7 1459      beard,' you wagtail?
7 1460   Corn. Peace, sirrah!
7 1461      You beastly knave, know you no reverence?
7 1462   Kent. Yes, sir, but anger hath a privilege.
7 1463   Corn. Why art thou angry?
7 1464   Kent. That such a slave as this should wear a sword,
7 1465      Who wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as these,
7 1466      Like rats, oft bite the holy cords atwain
7 1467      Which are too intrinse t' unloose; smooth every passion
7 1468      That in the natures of their lords rebel,
7 1469      Bring oil to fire, snow to their colder moods;
7 1470      Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks
7 1471      With every gale and vary of their masters,
7 1472      Knowing naught (like dogs) but following.
7 1473      A plague upon your epileptic visage! 
7 1474      Smile you my speeches, as I were a fool?
7 1475      Goose, an I had you upon Sarum Plain,
7 1476      I'ld drive ye cackling home to Camelot.
7 1477   Corn. What, art thou mad, old fellow?
7 1478   Glou. How fell you out? Say that.
7 1479   Kent. No contraries hold more antipathy
7 1480      Than I and such a knave.
7 1481   Corn. Why dost thou call him knave? What is his fault?
7 1482   Kent. His countenance likes me not.
7 1483   Corn. No more perchance does mine, or his, or hers.
7 1484   Kent. Sir, 'tis my occupation to be plain.
7 1485      I have seen better faces in my time
7 1486      Than stands on any shoulder that I see
7 1487      Before me at this instant.
7 1488   Corn. This is some fellow
7 1489      Who, having been prais'd for bluntness, doth affect
7 1490      A saucy roughness, and constrains the garb
7 1491      Quite from his nature. He cannot flatter, he!
7 1492      An honest mind and plain- he must speak truth!
7 1493      An they will take it, so; if not, he's plain. 
7 1494      These kind of knaves I know which in this plainness
7 1495      Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends
7 1496      Than twenty silly-ducking observants
7 1497      That stretch their duties nicely.
7 1498   Kent. Sir, in good faith, in sincere verity,
7 1499      Under th' allowance of your great aspect,
7 1500      Whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire
7 1501      On flickering Phoebus' front-
7 1502   Corn. What mean'st by this?
7 1503   Kent. To go out of my dialect, which you discommend so much. I
7 1504      know, sir, I am no flatterer. He that beguil'd you in a
7 1505 plain
7 1506      accent was a plain knave, which, for my part, I will not be,
7 1507      though I should win your displeasure to entreat me to't.
7 1508   Corn. What was th' offence you gave him?
7 1509   Osw. I never gave him any.
7 1510      It pleas'd the King his master very late
7 1511      To strike at me, upon his misconstruction;
7 1512      When he, conjunct, and flattering his displeasure,
7 1513      Tripp'd me behind; being down, insulted, rail'd
7 1514      And put upon him such a deal of man 
7 1515      That worthied him, got praises of the King
7 1516      For him attempting who was self-subdu'd;
7 1517      And, in the fleshment of this dread exploit,
7 1518      Drew on me here again.
7 1519   Kent. None of these rogues and cowards
7 1520      But Ajax is their fool.
7 1521   Corn. Fetch forth the stocks!
7 1522      You stubborn ancient knave, you reverent braggart,
7 1523      We'll teach you-
7 1524   Kent. Sir, I am too old to learn.
7 1525      Call not your stocks for me. I serve the King;
7 1526      On whose employment I was sent to you.
7 1527      You shall do small respect, show too bold malice
7 1528      Against the grace and person of my master,
7 1529      Stocking his messenger.
7 1530   Corn. Fetch forth the stocks! As I have life and honour,
7 1531      There shall he sit till noon.
7 1532   Reg. Till noon? Till night, my lord, and all night too!
7 1533   Kent. Why, madam, if I were your father's dog,
7 1534      You should not use me so. 
7 1535   Reg. Sir, being his knave, I will.
7 1536   Corn. This is a fellow of the selfsame colour
7 1537      Our sister speaks of. Come, bring away the stocks!
7 1538                                              Stocks brought out.
7 1539   Glou. Let me beseech your Grace not to do so.
7 1540      His fault is much, and the good King his master
7 1541      Will check him for't. Your purpos'd low correction
7 1542      Is such as basest and contemn'dest wretches
7 1543      For pilf'rings and most common trespasses
7 1544      Are punish'd with. The King must take it ill
7 1545      That he, so slightly valued in his messenger,
7 1546      Should have him thus restrain'd.
7 1547   Corn. I'll answer that.
7 1548   Reg. My sister may receive it much more worse,
7 1549      To have her gentleman abus'd, assaulted,
7 1550      For following her affairs. Put in his legs.-
7 1551                                     [Kent is put in the stocks.]
7 1552      Come, my good lord, away.
7 1553                            Exeunt [all but Gloucester and Kent].
7 1554   Glou. I am sorry for thee, friend. 'Tis the Duke's pleasure, 
7 1555      Whose disposition, all the world well knows,
7 1556      Will not be rubb'd nor stopp'd. I'll entreat for thee.
7 1557   Kent. Pray do not, sir. I have watch'd and travell'd hard.
7 1558      Some time I shall sleep out, the rest I'll whistle.
7 1559      A good man's fortune may grow out at heels.
7 1560      Give you good morrow!
7 1561   Glou. The Duke 's to blame in this; 'twill be ill taken.
7 1562 Exit.
7 1563   Kent. Good King, that must approve the common saw,
7 1564      Thou out of heaven's benediction com'st
7 1565      To the warm sun!
7 1566      Approach, thou beacon to this under globe,
7 1567      That by thy comfortable beams I may
7 1568      Peruse this letter. Nothing almost sees miracles
7 1569      But misery. I know 'tis from Cordelia,
7 1570      Who hath most fortunately been inform'd
7 1571      Of my obscured course- and [reads] 'shall find time
7 1572      From this enormous state, seeking to give
7 1573      Losses their remedies'- All weary and o'erwatch'd,
7 1574      Take vantage, heavy eyes, not to behold 
7 1575      This shameful lodging.
7 1576      Fortune, good night; smile once more, turn thy wheel.
7 1577                                                          Sleeps.

7 1583 The open country.
7 1584 
7 1585 Enter Edgar.
7 1586 
7 1587   Edg. I heard myself proclaim'd,
7 1588      And by the happy hollow of a tree
7 1589      Escap'd the hunt. No port is free, no place
7 1590      That guard and most unusual vigilance
7 1591      Does not attend my taking. Whiles I may scape,
7 1592      I will preserve myself; and am bethought
7 1593      To take the basest and most poorest shape
7 1594      That ever penury, in contempt of man,
7 1595      Brought near to beast. My face I'll grime with filth,
7 1596      Blanket my loins, elf all my hair in knots,
7 1597      And with presented nakedness outface
7 1598      The winds and persecutions of the sky.
7 1599      The country gives me proof and precedent
7 1600      Of Bedlam beggars, who, with roaring voices,
7 1601      Strike in their numb'd and mortified bare arms
7 1602      Pins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary;
7 1603      And with this horrible object, from low farms, 
7 1604      Poor pelting villages, sheepcotes, and mills,
7 1605      Sometime with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers,
7 1606      Enforce their charity. 'Poor Turlygod! poor Tom!'
7 1607      That's something yet! Edgar I nothing am.             Exit.

7 1612 Scene IV.
7 1613 Before Gloucester's Castle; Kent in the stocks.
7 1614 
7 1615 Enter Lear, Fool, and Gentleman.
7 1616 
7 1617   Lear. 'Tis strange that they should so depart from home,
7 1618      And not send back my messenger.
7 1619   Gent. As I learn'd,
7 1620      The night before there was no purpose in them
7 1621      Of this remove.
7 1622   Kent. Hail to thee, noble master!
7 1623   Lear. Ha!
7 1624      Mak'st thou this shame thy pastime?
7 1625   Kent. No, my lord.
7 1626   Fool. Ha, ha! look! he wears cruel garters. Horses are tied by
7 1627 the
7 1628      head, dogs and bears by th' neck, monkeys by th' loins, and
7 1629 men
7 1630      by th' legs. When a man's over-lusty at legs, then he wears
7 1631      wooden nether-stocks.
7 1632   Lear. What's he that hath so much thy place mistook
7 1633      To set thee here?
7 1634   Kent. It is both he and she-
7 1635      Your son and daughter. 
7 1636   Lear. No.
7 1637   Kent. Yes.
7 1638   Lear. No, I say.
7 1639   Kent. I say yea.
7 1640   Lear. No, no, they would not!
7 1641   Kent. Yes, they have.
7 1642   Lear. By Jupiter, I swear no!
7 1643   Kent. By Juno, I swear ay!
7 1644   Lear. They durst not do't;
7 1645      They would not, could not do't. 'Tis worse than murther
7 1646      To do upon respect such violent outrage.
7 1647      Resolve me with all modest haste which way
7 1648      Thou mightst deserve or they impose this usage,
7 1649      Coming from us.
7 1650   Kent. My lord, when at their home
7 1651      I did commend your Highness' letters to them,
7 1652      Ere I was risen from the place that show'd
7 1653      My duty kneeling, came there a reeking post,
7 1654      Stew'd in his haste, half breathless, panting forth
7 1655      From Goneril his mistress salutations; 
7 1656      Deliver'd letters, spite of intermission,
7 1657      Which presently they read; on whose contents,
7 1658      They summon'd up their meiny, straight took horse,
7 1659      Commanded me to follow and attend
7 1660      The leisure of their answer, gave me cold looks,
7 1661      And meeting here the other messenger,
7 1662      Whose welcome I perceiv'd had poison'd mine-
7 1663      Being the very fellow which of late
7 1664      Display'd so saucily against your Highness-
7 1665      Having more man than wit about me, drew.
7 1666      He rais'd the house with loud and coward cries.
7 1667      Your son and daughter found this trespass worth
7 1668      The shame which here it suffers.
7 1669   Fool. Winter's not gone yet, if the wild geese fly that way.
7 1670 
7 1671           Fathers that wear rags
7 1672             Do make their children blind;
7 1673           But fathers that bear bags
7 1674             Shall see their children kind.
7 1675           Fortune, that arrant whore, 
7 1676           Ne'er turns the key to th' poor.
7 1677 
7 1678      But for all this, thou shalt have as many dolours for thy
7 1679      daughters as thou canst tell in a year.
7 1680   Lear. O, how this mother swells up toward my heart!
7 1681      Hysterica passio! Down, thou climbing sorrow!
7 1682      Thy element's below! Where is this daughter?
7 1683   Kent. With the Earl, sir, here within.
7 1684   Lear. Follow me not;
7 1685      Stay here.                                            Exit.
7 1686   Gent. Made you no more offence but what you speak of?
7 1687   Kent. None.
7 1688      How chance the King comes with so small a number?
7 1689   Fool. An thou hadst been set i' th' stocks for that question,
7 1690      thou'dst well deserv'd it.
7 1691   Kent. Why, fool?
7 1692   Fool. We'll set thee to school to an ant, to teach thee there's
7 1693 no
7 1694      labouring i' th' winter. All that follow their noses are led
7 1695 by
7 1696      their eyes but blind men, and there's not a nose among
7 1697 twenty
7 1698      but can smell him that's stinking. Let go thy hold when a
7 1699 great 
7 1700      wheel runs down a hill, lest it break thy neck with
7 1701 following
7 1702      it; but the great one that goes upward, let him draw thee
7 1703 after.
7 1704      When a wise man gives thee better counsel, give me mine
7 1705 again. I
7 1706      would have none but knaves follow it, since a fool gives it.
7 1707           That sir which serves and seeks for gain,
7 1708             And follows but for form,
7 1709           Will pack when it begins to rain
7 1710             And leave thee in the storm.
7 1711           But I will tarry; the fool will stay,
7 1712             And let the wise man fly.
7 1713           The knave turns fool that runs away;
7 1714             The fool no knave, perdy.
7 1715   Kent. Where learn'd you this, fool?
7 1716   Fool. Not i' th' stocks, fool.
7 1717 
7 1718                       Enter Lear and Gloucester
7 1719 
7 1720   Lear. Deny to speak with me? They are sick? they are weary?
7 1721      They have travell'd all the night? Mere fetches-
7 1722      The images of revolt and flying off! 
7 1723      Fetch me a better answer.
7 1724   Glou. My dear lord,
7 1725      You know the fiery quality of the Duke,
7 1726      How unremovable and fix'd he is
7 1727      In his own course.
7 1728   Lear. Vengeance! plague! death! confusion!
7 1729      Fiery? What quality? Why, Gloucester, Gloucester,
7 1730      I'ld speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.
7 1731   Glou. Well, my good lord, I have inform'd them so.
7 1732   Lear. Inform'd them? Dost thou understand me, man?
7 1733   Glou. Ay, my good lord.
7 1734   Lear. The King would speak with Cornwall; the dear father
7 1735      Would with his daughter speak, commands her service.
7 1736      Are they inform'd of this? My breath and blood!
7 1737      Fiery? the fiery Duke? Tell the hot Duke that-
7 1738      No, but not yet! May be he is not well.
7 1739      Infirmity doth still neglect all office
7 1740      Whereto our health is bound. We are not ourselves
7 1741      When nature, being oppress'd, commands the mind
7 1742      To suffer with the body. I'll forbear; 
7 1743      And am fallen out with my more headier will,
7 1744      To take the indispos'd and sickly fit
7 1745      For the sound man.- Death on my state! Wherefore
7 1746      Should be sit here? This act persuades me
7 1747      That this remotion of the Duke and her
7 1748      Is practice only. Give me my servant forth.
7 1749      Go tell the Duke and 's wife I'ld speak with them-
7 1750      Now, presently. Bid them come forth and hear me,
7 1751      Or at their chamber door I'll beat the drum
7 1752      Till it cry sleep to death.
7 1753   Glou. I would have all well betwixt you.                 Exit.
7 1754   Lear. O me, my heart, my rising heart! But down!
7 1755   Fool. Cry to it, nuncle, as the cockney did to the eels when
7 1756 she
7 1757      put 'em i' th' paste alive. She knapp'd 'em o' th' coxcombs
7 1758 with
7 1759      a stick and cried 'Down, wantons, down!' 'Twas her brother
7 1760 that,
7 1761      in pure kindness to his horse, buttered his hay.
7 1762 
7 1763              Enter Cornwall, Regan, Gloucester, Servants.
7 1764 
7 1765   Lear. Good morrow to you both. 
7 1766   Corn. Hail to your Grace!
7 1767                                        Kent here set at liberty.
7 1768   Reg. I am glad to see your Highness.
7 1769   Lear. Regan, I think you are; I know what reason
7 1770      I have to think so. If thou shouldst not be glad,
7 1771      I would divorce me from thy mother's tomb,
7 1772      Sepulchring an adultress. [To Kent] O, are you free?
7 1773      Some other time for that.- Beloved Regan,
7 1774      Thy sister's naught. O Regan, she hath tied
7 1775      Sharp-tooth'd unkindness, like a vulture, here!
7 1776                                    [Lays his hand on his heart.]
7 1777      I can scarce speak to thee. Thou'lt not believe
7 1778      With how deprav'd a quality- O Regan!
7 1779   Reg. I pray you, sir, take patience. I have hope
7 1780      You less know how to value her desert
7 1781      Than she to scant her duty.
7 1782   Lear. Say, how is that?
7 1783   Reg. I cannot think my sister in the least
7 1784      Would fail her obligation. If, sir, perchance
7 1785      She have restrain'd the riots of your followers, 
7 1786      'Tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end,
7 1787      As clears her from all blame.
7 1788   Lear. My curses on her!
7 1789   Reg. O, sir, you are old!
7 1790      Nature in you stands on the very verge
7 1791      Of her confine. You should be rul'd, and led
7 1792      By some discretion that discerns your state
7 1793      Better than you yourself. Therefore I pray you
7 1794      That to our sister you do make return;
7 1795      Say you have wrong'd her, sir.
7 1796   Lear. Ask her forgiveness?
7 1797      Do you but mark how this becomes the house:
7 1798      'Dear daughter, I confess that I am old.          [Kneels.]
7 1799      Age is unnecessary. On my knees I beg
7 1800      That you'll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.'
7 1801   Reg. Good sir, no more! These are unsightly tricks.
7 1802      Return you to my sister.
7 1803   Lear. [rises] Never, Regan!
7 1804      She hath abated me of half my train;
7 1805      Look'd black upon me; struck me with her tongue, 
7 1806      Most serpent-like, upon the very heart.
7 1807      All the stor'd vengeances of heaven fall
7 1808      On her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones,
7 1809      You taking airs, with lameness!
7 1810   Corn. Fie, sir, fie!
7 1811   Lear. You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames
7 1812      Into her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty,
7 1813      You fen-suck'd fogs, drawn by the pow'rful sun,
7 1814      To fall and blast her pride!
7 1815   Reg. O the blest gods! so will you wish on me
7 1816      When the rash mood is on.
7 1817   Lear. No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse.
7 1818      Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give
7 1819      Thee o'er to harshness. Her eyes are fierce; but thine
7 1820      Do comfort, and not burn. 'Tis not in thee
7 1821      To grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,
7 1822      To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,
7 1823      And, in conclusion, to oppose the bolt
7 1824      Against my coming in. Thou better know'st
7 1825      The offices of nature, bond of childhood, 
7 1826      Effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude.
7 1827      Thy half o' th' kingdom hast thou not forgot,
7 1828      Wherein I thee endow'd.
7 1829   Reg. Good sir, to th' purpose.
7 1830                                                   Tucket within.
7 1831   Lear. Who put my man i' th' stocks?
7 1832   Corn. What trumpet's that?
7 1833   Reg. I know't- my sister's. This approves her letter,
7 1834      That she would soon be here.
7 1835 
7 1836                      Enter [Oswald the] Steward.
7 1837 
7 1838      Is your lady come?
7 1839   Lear. This is a slave, whose easy-borrowed pride
7 1840      Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows.
7 1841      Out, varlet, from my sight!
7 1842   Corn. What means your Grace?
7 1843 
7 1844                             Enter Goneril.
7 1845  
7 1846   Lear. Who stock'd my servant? Regan, I have good hope
7 1847      Thou didst not know on't.- Who comes here? O heavens!
7 1848      If you do love old men, if your sweet sway
7 1849      Allow obedience- if yourselves are old,
7 1850      Make it your cause! Send down, and take my part!
7 1851      [To Goneril] Art not asham'd to look upon this beard?-
7 1852      O Regan, wilt thou take her by the hand?
7 1853   Gon. Why not by th' hand, sir? How have I offended?
7 1854      All's not offence that indiscretion finds
7 1855      And dotage terms so.
7 1856   Lear. O sides, you are too tough!
7 1857      Will you yet hold? How came my man i' th' stocks?
7 1858   Corn. I set him there, sir; but his own disorders
7 1859      Deserv'd much less advancement.
7 1860   Lear. You? Did you?
7 1861   Reg. I pray you, father, being weak, seem so.
7 1862      If, till the expiration of your month,
7 1863      You will return and sojourn with my sister,
7 1864      Dismissing half your train, come then to me.
7 1865      I am now from home, and out of that provision 
7 1866      Which shall be needful for your entertainment.
7 1867   Lear. Return to her, and fifty men dismiss'd?
7 1868      No, rather I abjure all roofs, and choose
7 1869      To wage against the enmity o' th' air,
7 1870      To be a comrade with the wolf and owl-
7 1871      Necessity's sharp pinch! Return with her?
7 1872      Why, the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took
7 1873      Our youngest born, I could as well be brought
7 1874      To knee his throne, and, squire-like, pension beg
7 1875      To keep base life afoot. Return with her?
7 1876      Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter
7 1877      To this detested groom.                 [Points at Oswald.]
7 1878   Gon. At your choice, sir.
7 1879   Lear. I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad.
7 1880      I will not trouble thee, my child; farewell.
7 1881      We'll no more meet, no more see one another.
7 1882      But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter;
7 1883      Or rather a disease that's in my flesh,
7 1884      Which I must needs call mine. Thou art a boil,
7 1885      A plague sore, an embossed carbuncle 
7 1886      In my corrupted blood. But I'll not chide thee.
7 1887      Let shame come when it will, I do not call it.
7 1888      I do not bid the Thunder-bearer shoot
7 1889      Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove.
7 1890      Mend when thou canst; be better at thy leisure;
7 1891      I can be patient, I can stay with Regan,
7 1892      I and my hundred knights.
7 1893   Reg. Not altogether so.
7 1894      I look'd not for you yet, nor am provided
7 1895      For your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister;
7 1896      For those that mingle reason with your passion
7 1897      Must be content to think you old, and so-
7 1898      But she knows what she does.
7 1899   Lear. Is this well spoken?
7 1900   Reg. I dare avouch it, sir. What, fifty followers?
7 1901      Is it not well? What should you need of more?
7 1902      Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger
7 1903      Speak 'gainst so great a number? How in one house
7 1904      Should many people, under two commands,
7 1905      Hold amity? 'Tis hard; almost impossible. 
7 1906   Gon. Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance
7 1907      From those that she calls servants, or from mine?
7 1908   Reg. Why not, my lord? If then they chanc'd to slack ye,
7 1909      We could control them. If you will come to me
7 1910      (For now I spy a danger), I entreat you
7 1911      To bring but five-and-twenty. To no more
7 1912      Will I give place or notice.
7 1913   Lear. I gave you all-
7 1914   Reg. And in good time you gave it!
7 1915   Lear. Made you my guardians, my depositaries;
7 1916      But kept a reservation to be followed
7 1917      With such a number. What, must I come to you
7 1918      With five-and-twenty, Regan? Said you so?
7 1919   Reg. And speak't again my lord. No more with me.
7 1920   Lear. Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favour'd
7 1921      When others are more wicked; not being the worst
7 1922      Stands in some rank of praise. [To Goneril] I'll go with
7 1923 thee.
7 1924      Thy fifty yet doth double five-and-twenty,
7 1925      And thou art twice her love.
7 1926   Gon. Hear, me, my lord. 
7 1927      What need you five-and-twenty, ten, or five,
7 1928      To follow in a house where twice so many
7 1929      Have a command to tend you?
7 1930   Reg. What need one?
7 1931   Lear. O, reason not the need! Our basest beggars
7 1932      Are in the poorest thing superfluous.
7 1933      Allow not nature more than nature needs,
7 1934      Man's life is cheap as beast's. Thou art a lady:
7 1935      If only to go warm were gorgeous,
7 1936      Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st
7 1937      Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need-
7 1938      You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!
7 1939      You see me here, you gods, a poor old man,
7 1940      As full of grief as age; wretched in both.
7 1941      If it be you that stirs these daughters' hearts
7 1942      Against their father, fool me not so much
7 1943      To bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger,
7 1944      And let not women's weapons, water drops,
7 1945      Stain my man's cheeks! No, you unnatural hags!
7 1946      I will have such revenges on you both 
7 1947      That all the world shall- I will do such things-
7 1948      What they are yet, I know not; but they shall be
7 1949      The terrors of the earth! You think I'll weep.
7 1950      No, I'll not weep.
7 1951      I have full cause of weeping, but this heart
7 1952      Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws
7 1953      Or ere I'll weep. O fool, I shall go mad!
7 1954               Exeunt Lear, Gloucester, Kent, and Fool. Storm and
7 1955                                                         tempest.
7 1956   Corn. Let us withdraw; 'twill be a storm.
7 1957   Reg. This house is little; the old man and 's people
7 1958      Cannot be well bestow'd.
7 1959   Gon. 'Tis his own blame; hath put himself from rest
7 1960      And must needs taste his folly.
7 1961   Reg. For his particular, I'll receive him gladly,
7 1962      But not one follower.
7 1963   Gon. So am I purpos'd.
7 1964      Where is my Lord of Gloucester?
7 1965   Corn. Followed the old man forth.
7 1966  
7 1967                           Enter Gloucester.
7 1968 
7 1969      He is return'd.
7 1970   Glou. The King is in high rage.
7 1971   Corn. Whither is he going?
7 1972   Glou. He calls to horse, but will I know not whither.
7 1973   Corn. 'Tis best to give him way; he leads himself.
7 1974   Gon. My lord, entreat him by no means to stay.
7 1975   Glou. Alack, the night comes on, and the bleak winds
7 1976      Do sorely ruffle. For many miles about
7 1977      There's scarce a bush.
7 1978   Reg. O, sir, to wilful men
7 1979      The injuries that they themselves procure
7 1980      Must be their schoolmasters. Shut up your doors.
7 1981      He is attended with a desperate train,
7 1982      And what they may incense him to, being apt
7 1983      To have his ear abus'd, wisdom bids fear.
7 1984   Corn. Shut up your doors, my lord: 'tis a wild night.
7 1985      My Regan counsels well. Come out o' th' storm.       
7 1986 [Exeunt.]

7 2002 ACT III. Scene I.
7 2003 A heath.
7 2004 
7 2005 Storm still. Enter Kent and a Gentleman at several doors.
7 2006 
7 2007   Kent. Who's there, besides foul weather?
7 2008   Gent. One minded like the weather, most unquietly.
7 2009   Kent. I know you. Where's the King?
7 2010   Gent. Contending with the fretful elements;
7 2011      Bids the wind blow the earth into the sea,
7 2012      Or swell the curled waters 'bove the main,
7 2013      That things might change or cease; tears his white hair,
7 2014      Which the impetuous blasts, with eyeless rage,
7 2015      Catch in their fury and make nothing of;
7 2016      Strives in his little world of man to outscorn
7 2017      The to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain.
7 2018      This night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch,
7 2019      The lion and the belly-pinched wolf
7 2020      Keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs,
7 2021      And bids what will take all.
7 2022   Kent. But who is with him?
7 2023   Gent. None but the fool, who labours to outjest 
7 2024      His heart-struck injuries.
7 2025   Kent. Sir, I do know you,
7 2026      And dare upon the warrant of my note
7 2027      Commend a dear thing to you. There is division
7 2028      (Although as yet the face of it be cover'd
7 2029      With mutual cunning) 'twixt Albany and Cornwall;
7 2030      Who have (as who have not, that their great stars
7 2031      Thron'd and set high?) servants, who seem no less,
7 2032      Which are to France the spies and speculations
7 2033      Intelligent of our state. What hath been seen,
7 2034      Either in snuffs and packings of the Dukes,
7 2035      Or the hard rein which both of them have borne
7 2036      Against the old kind King, or something deeper,
7 2037      Whereof, perchance, these are but furnishings-
7 2038      But, true it is, from France there comes a power
7 2039      Into this scattered kingdom, who already,
7 2040      Wise in our negligence, have secret feet
7 2041      In some of our best ports and are at point
7 2042      To show their open banner. Now to you:
7 2043      If on my credit you dare build so far 
7 2044      To make your speed to Dover, you shall find
7 2045      Some that will thank you, making just report
7 2046      Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow
7 2047      The King hath cause to plain.
7 2048      I am a gentleman of blood and breeding,
7 2049      And from some knowledge and assurance offer
7 2050      This office to you.
7 2051   Gent. I will talk further with you.
7 2052   Kent. No, do not.
7 2053      For confirmation that I am much more
7 2054      Than my out-wall, open this purse and take
7 2055      What it contains. If you shall see Cordelia
7 2056      (As fear not but you shall), show her this ring,
7 2057      And she will tell you who your fellow is
7 2058      That yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!
7 2059      I will go seek the King.
7 2060   Gent. Give me your hand. Have you no more to say?
7 2061   Kent. Few words, but, to effect, more than all yet:
7 2062      That, when we have found the King (in which your pain
7 2063      That way, I'll this), he that first lights on him 
7 2064      Holla the other.
7 2065                                              Exeunt [severally].

7 2070 Scene II.
7 2071 Another part of the heath.
7 2072 
7 2073 Storm still. Enter Lear and Fool.
7 2074 
7 2075   Lear. Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow!
7 2076      You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout
7 2077      Till you have drench'd our steeples, drown'd the cocks!
7 2078      You sulph'rous and thought-executing fires,
7 2079      Vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts,
7 2080      Singe my white head! And thou, all-shaking thunder,
7 2081      Strike flat the thick rotundity o' th' world,
7 2082      Crack Nature's moulds, all germains spill at once,
7 2083      That makes ingrateful man!
7 2084   Fool. O nuncle, court holy water in a dry house is better than
7 2085 this
7 2086      rain water out o' door. Good nuncle, in, and ask thy
7 2087 daughters
7 2088      blessing! Here's a night pities nether wise men nor fools.
7 2089   Lear. Rumble thy bellyful! Spit, fire! spout, rain!
7 2090      Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire are my daughters.
7 2091      I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness.
7 2092      I never gave you kingdom, call'd you children,
7 2093      You owe me no subscription. Then let fall 
7 2094      Your horrible pleasure. Here I stand your slave,
7 2095      A poor, infirm, weak, and despis'd old man.
7 2096      But yet I call you servile ministers,
7 2097      That will with two pernicious daughters join
7 2098      Your high-engender'd battles 'gainst a head
7 2099      So old and white as this! O! O! 'tis foul!
7 2100   Fool. He that has a house to put 's head in has a good
7 2101 head-piece.
7 2102           The codpiece that will house
7 2103             Before the head has any,
7 2104           The head and he shall louse:
7 2105             So beggars marry many.
7 2106           The man that makes his toe
7 2107             What he his heart should make
7 2108           Shall of a corn cry woe,
7 2109             And turn his sleep to wake.
7 2110      For there was never yet fair woman but she made mouths in a
7 2111      glass.
7 2112 
7 2113                              Enter Kent.
7 2114  
7 2115   Lear. No, I will be the pattern of all patience;
7 2116      I will say nothing.
7 2117   Kent. Who's there?
7 2118   Fool. Marry, here's grace and a codpiece; that's a wise man and
7 2119 a
7 2120      fool.
7 2121   Kent. Alas, sir, are you here? Things that love night
7 2122      Love not such nights as these. The wrathful skies
7 2123      Gallow the very wanderers of the dark
7 2124      And make them keep their caves. Since I was man,
7 2125      Such sheets of fire, such bursts of horrid thunder,
7 2126      Such groans of roaring wind and rain, I never
7 2127      Remember to have heard. Man's nature cannot carry
7 2128      Th' affliction nor the fear.
7 2129   Lear. Let the great gods,
7 2130      That keep this dreadful pudder o'er our heads,
7 2131      Find out their enemies now. Tremble, thou wretch,
7 2132      That hast within thee undivulged crimes
7 2133      Unwhipp'd of justice. Hide thee, thou bloody hand;
7 2134      Thou perjur'd, and thou simular man of virtue
7 2135      That art incestuous. Caitiff, in pieces shake 
7 2136      That under covert and convenient seeming
7 2137      Hast practis'd on man's life. Close pent-up guilts,
7 2138      Rive your concealing continents, and cry
7 2139      These dreadful summoners grace. I am a man
7 2140      More sinn'd against than sinning.
7 2141   Kent. Alack, bareheaded?
7 2142      Gracious my lord, hard by here is a hovel;
7 2143      Some friendship will it lend you 'gainst the tempest.
7 2144      Repose you there, whilst I to this hard house
7 2145      (More harder than the stones whereof 'tis rais'd,
7 2146      Which even but now, demanding after you,
7 2147      Denied me to come in) return, and force
7 2148      Their scanted courtesy.
7 2149   Lear. My wits begin to turn.
7 2150      Come on, my boy. How dost, my boy? Art cold?
7 2151      I am cold myself. Where is this straw, my fellow?
7 2152      The art of our necessities is strange,
7 2153      That can make vile things precious. Come, your hovel.
7 2154      Poor fool and knave, I have one part in my heart
7 2155      That's sorry yet for thee. 
7 2156   Fool. [sings]
7 2157 
7 2158           He that has and a little tiny wit-
7 2159             With hey, ho, the wind and the rain-
7 2160           Must make content with his fortunes fit,
7 2161              For the rain it raineth every day.
7 2162 
7 2163   Lear. True, my good boy. Come, bring us to this hovel.
7 2164                                          Exeunt [Lear and Kent].
7 2165   Fool. This is a brave night to cool a courtesan. I'll speak a
7 2166      prophecy ere I go:
7 2167           When priests are more in word than matter;
7 2168           When brewers mar their malt with water;
7 2169           When nobles are their tailors' tutors,
7 2170           No heretics burn'd, but wenches' suitors;
7 2171           When every case in law is right,
7 2172           No squire in debt nor no poor knight;
7 2173           When slanders do not live in tongues,
7 2174           Nor cutpurses come not to throngs;
7 2175           When usurers tell their gold i' th' field, 
7 2176           And bawds and whores do churches build:
7 2177           Then shall the realm of Albion
7 2178           Come to great confusion.
7 2179           Then comes the time, who lives to see't,
7 2180           That going shall be us'd with feet.
7 2181      This prophecy Merlin shall make, for I live before his time.
7 2182 Exit.

7 2187 Scene III.
7 2188 Gloucester's Castle.
7 2189 
7 2190 Enter Gloucester and Edmund.
7 2191 
7 2192   Glou. Alack, alack, Edmund, I like not this unnatural dealing!
7 2193 When
7 2194      I desir'd their leave that I might pity him, they took from
7 2195 me
7 2196      the use of mine own house, charg'd me on pain of perpetual
7 2197      displeasure neither to speak of him, entreat for him, nor
7 2198 any
7 2199      way sustain him.
7 2200   Edm. Most savage and unnatural!
7 2201   Glou. Go to; say you nothing. There is division betwixt the
7 2202 Dukes,
7 2203      and a worse matter than that. I have received a letter this
7 2204      night- 'tis dangerous to be spoken- I have lock'd the letter
7 2205 in
7 2206      my closet. These injuries the King now bears will be
7 2207 revenged
7 2208      home; there's part of a power already footed; we must
7 2209 incline to
7 2210      the King. I will seek him and privily relieve him. Go you
7 2211 and
7 2212      maintain talk with the Duke, that my charity be not of him
7 2213      perceived. If he ask for me, I am ill and gone to bed.
7 2214 Though I
7 2215      die for't, as no less is threat'ned me, the King my old
7 2216 master
7 2217      must be relieved. There is some strange thing toward,
7 2218 Edmund.
7 2219      Pray you be careful.                                  Exit. 
7 2220   Edm. This courtesy, forbid thee, shall the Duke
7 2221      Instantly know, and of that letter too.
7 2222      This seems a fair deserving, and must draw me
7 2223      That which my father loses- no less than all.
7 2224      The younger rises when the old doth fall.             Exit.
7 2225

7 2229 Scene IV.
7 2230 The heath. Before a hovel.
7 2231 
7 2232 Storm still. Enter Lear, Kent, and Fool.
7 2233 
7 2234   Kent. Here is the place, my lord. Good my lord, enter.
7 2235      The tyranny of the open night 's too rough
7 2236      For nature to endure.
7 2237   Lear. Let me alone.
7 2238   Kent. Good my lord, enter here.
7 2239   Lear. Wilt break my heart?
7 2240   Kent. I had rather break mine own. Good my lord, enter.
7 2241   Lear. Thou think'st 'tis much that this contentious storm
7 2242      Invades us to the skin. So 'tis to thee;
7 2243      But where the greater malady is fix'd,
7 2244      The lesser is scarce felt. Thou'dst shun a bear;
7 2245      But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea,
7 2246      Thou'dst meet the bear i' th' mouth. When the mind's free,
7 2247      The body's delicate. The tempest in my mind
7 2248      Doth from my senses take all feeling else
7 2249      Save what beats there. Filial ingratitude!
7 2250      Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand 
7 2251      For lifting food to't? But I will punish home!
7 2252      No, I will weep no more. In such a night
7 2253      'To shut me out! Pour on; I will endure.
7 2254      In such a night as this! O Regan, Goneril!
7 2255      Your old kind father, whose frank heart gave all!
7 2256      O, that way madness lies; let me shun that!
7 2257      No more of that.
7 2258   Kent. Good my lord, enter here.
7 2259   Lear. Prithee go in thyself; seek thine own ease.
7 2260      This tempest will not give me leave to ponder
7 2261      On things would hurt me more. But I'll go in.
7 2262      [To the Fool] In, boy; go first.- You houseless poverty-
7 2263      Nay, get thee in. I'll pray, and then I'll sleep.
7 2264                                                     Exit [Fool].
7 2265      Poor naked wretches, wheresoe'er you are,
7 2266      That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,
7 2267      How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,
7 2268      Your loop'd and window'd raggedness, defend you
7 2269      From seasons such as these? O, I have ta'en
7 2270      Too little care of this! Take physic, pomp; 
7 2271      Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
7 2272      That thou mayst shake the superflux to them
7 2273      And show the heavens more just.
7 2274   Edg. [within] Fathom and half, fathom and half! Poor Tom!
7 2275 
7 2276                      Enter Fool [from the hovel].
7 2277 
7 2278   Fool. Come not in here, nuncle, here's a spirit. Help me, help
7 2279 me!
7 2280   Kent. Give me thy hand. Who's there?
7 2281   Fool. A spirit, a spirit! He says his name's poor Tom.
7 2282   Kent. What art thou that dost grumble there i' th' straw?
7 2283      Come forth.
7 2284 
7 2285                  Enter Edgar [disguised as a madman].
7 2286 
7 2287   Edg. Away! the foul fiend follows me! Through the sharp
7 2288 hawthorn
7 2289      blows the cold wind. Humh! go to thy cold bed, and warm
7 2290 thee.
7 2291   Lear. Hast thou given all to thy two daughters, and art thou
7 2292 come
7 2293      to this?
7 2294   Edg. Who gives anything to poor Tom? whom the foul fiend hath
7 2295 led 
7 2296      through fire and through flame, through ford and whirlpool,
7 2297 o'er
7 2298      bog and quagmire; that hath laid knives under his pillow and
7 2299      halters in his pew, set ratsbane by his porridge, made him
7 2300 proud
7 2301      of heart, to ride on a bay trotting horse over four-inch'd
7 2302      bridges, to course his own shadow for a traitor. Bless thy
7 2303 five
7 2304      wits! Tom 's acold. O, do de, do de, do de. Bless thee from
7 2305      whirlwinds, star-blasting, and taking! Do poor Tom some
7 2306 charity,
7 2307      whom the foul fiend vexes. There could I have him now- and
7 2308 there-
7 2309      and there again- and there!
7 2310                                                     Storm still.
7 2311   Lear. What, have his daughters brought him to this pass?
7 2312      Couldst thou save nothing? Didst thou give 'em all?
7 2313   Fool. Nay, he reserv'd a blanket, else we had been all sham'd.
7 2314   Lear. Now all the plagues that in the pendulous air
7 2315      Hang fated o'er men's faults light on thy daughters!
7 2316   Kent. He hath no daughters, sir.
7 2317   Lear. Death, traitor! nothing could have subdu'd nature
7 2318      To such a lowness but his unkind daughters.
7 2319      Is it the fashion that discarded fathers
7 2320      Should have thus little mercy on their flesh? 
7 2321      Judicious punishment! 'Twas this flesh begot
7 2322      Those pelican daughters.
7 2323   Edg. Pillicock sat on Pillicock's Hill. 'Allow, 'allow, loo,
7 2324 loo!
7 2325   Fool. This cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen.
7 2326   Edg. Take heed o' th' foul fiend; obey thy parents: keep thy
7 2327 word
7 2328      justly; swear not; commit not with man's sworn spouse; set
7 2329 not
7 2330      thy sweet heart on proud array. Tom 's acold.
7 2331   Lear. What hast thou been?
7 2332   Edg. A servingman, proud in heart and mind; that curl'd my
7 2333 hair,
7 2334      wore gloves in my cap; serv'd the lust of my mistress' heart
7 2335 and
7 2336      did the act of darkness with her; swore as many oaths as I
7 2337 spake
7 2338      words, and broke them in the sweet face of heaven; one that
7 2339      slept in the contriving of lust, and wak'd to do it. Wine
7 2340 lov'd
7 2341      I deeply, dice dearly; and in woman out-paramour'd the Turk.
7 2342      False of heart, light of ear, bloody of hand; hog in sloth,
7 2343 fox
7 2344      in stealth, wolf in greediness, dog in madness, lion in
7 2345 prey.
7 2346      Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of silks
7 2347 betray
7 2348      thy poor heart to woman. Keep thy foot out of brothel, thy
7 2349 hand
7 2350      out of placket, thy pen from lender's book, and defy the
7 2351 foul
7 2352      fiend. Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind; says 
7 2353      suum, mun, hey, no, nonny. Dolphin my boy, my boy, sessa!
7 2354 let
7 2355      him trot by.
7 2356                                                     Storm still.
7 2357   Lear. Why, thou wert better in thy grave than to answer with
7 2358 thy
7 2359      uncover'd body this extremity of the skies. Is man no more
7 2360 than
7 2361      this? Consider him well. Thou ow'st the worm no silk, the
7 2362 beast
7 2363      no hide, the sheep no wool, the cat no perfume. Ha! Here's
7 2364 three
7 2365      on's are sophisticated! Thou art the thing itself;
7 2366      unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor, bare, forked
7 2367      animal as thou art. Off, off, you lendings! Come, unbutton
7 2368      here.
7 2369                                          [Tears at his clothes.]
7 2370   Fool. Prithee, nuncle, be contented! 'Tis a naughty night to
7 2371 swim
7 2372      in. Now a little fire in a wild field were like an old
7 2373 lecher's
7 2374      heart- a small spark, all the rest on's body cold. Look,
7 2375 here
7 2376      comes a walking fire.
7 2377 
7 2378                     Enter Gloucester with a torch.
7 2379 
7 2380   Edg. This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet. He begins at
7 2381 curfew, 
7 2382      and walks till the first cock. He gives the web and the pin,
7 2383      squints the eye, and makes the harelip; mildews the white
7 2384 wheat,
7 2385      and hurts the poor creature of earth.
7 2386 
7 2387            Saint Withold footed thrice the 'old;
7 2388            He met the nightmare, and her nine fold;
7 2389               Bid her alight
7 2390               And her troth plight,
7 2391            And aroint thee, witch, aroint thee!
7 2392 
7 2393   Kent. How fares your Grace?
7 2394   Lear. What's he?
7 2395   Kent. Who's there? What is't you seek?
7 2396   Glou. What are you there? Your names?
7 2397   Edg. Poor Tom, that eats the swimming frog, the toad, the
7 2398 todpole,
7 2399      the wall-newt and the water; that in the fury of his heart,
7 2400 when
7 2401      the foul fiend rages, eats cow-dung for sallets, swallows
7 2402 the
7 2403      old rat and the ditch-dog, drinks the green mantle of the
7 2404      standing pool; who is whipp'd from tithing to tithing, and
7 2405      stock-punish'd and imprison'd; who hath had three suits to
7 2406 his 
7 2407      back, six shirts to his body, horse to ride, and weapons to
7 2408      wear;
7 2409 
7 2410           But mice and rats, and such small deer,
7 2411           Have been Tom's food for seven long year.
7 2412 
7 2413      Beware my follower. Peace, Smulkin! peace, thou fiend!
7 2414   Glou. What, hath your Grace no better company?
7 2415   Edg. The prince of darkness is a gentleman!
7 2416      Modo he's call'd, and Mahu.
7 2417   Glou. Our flesh and blood is grown so vile, my lord,
7 2418      That it doth hate what gets it.
7 2419   Edg. Poor Tom 's acold.
7 2420   Glou. Go in with me. My duty cannot suffer
7 2421      T' obey in all your daughters' hard commands.
7 2422      Though their injunction be to bar my doors
7 2423      And let this tyrannous night take hold upon you,
7 2424      Yet have I ventur'd to come seek you out
7 2425      And bring you where both fire and food is ready.
7 2426   Lear. First let me talk with this philosopher. 
7 2427      What is the cause of thunder?
7 2428   Kent. Good my lord, take his offer; go into th' house.
7 2429   Lear. I'll talk a word with this same learned Theban.
7 2430      What is your study?
7 2431   Edg. How to prevent the fiend and to kill vermin.
7 2432   Lear. Let me ask you one word in private.
7 2433   Kent. Importune him once more to go, my lord.
7 2434      His wits begin t' unsettle.
7 2435   Glou. Canst thou blame him?
7 2436                                                     Storm still.
7 2437      His daughters seek his death. Ah, that good Kent!
7 2438      He said it would be thus- poor banish'd man!
7 2439      Thou say'st the King grows mad: I'll tell thee, friend,
7 2440      I am almost mad myself. I had a son,
7 2441      Now outlaw'd from my blood. He sought my life
7 2442      But lately, very late. I lov'd him, friend-
7 2443      No father his son dearer. True to tell thee,
7 2444      The grief hath craz'd my wits. What a night 's this!
7 2445      I do beseech your Grace-
7 2446   Lear. O, cry you mercy, sir. 
7 2447      Noble philosopher, your company.
7 2448   Edg. Tom's acold.
7 2449   Glou. In, fellow, there, into th' hovel; keep thee warm.
7 2450   Lear. Come, let's in all.
7 2451   Kent. This way, my lord.
7 2452   Lear. With him!
7 2453      I will keep still with my philosopher.
7 2454   Kent. Good my lord, soothe him; let him take the fellow.
7 2455   Glou. Take him you on.
7 2456   Kent. Sirrah, come on; go along with us.
7 2457   Lear. Come, good Athenian.
7 2458   Glou. No words, no words! hush.
7 2459   Edg. Child Rowland to the dark tower came;
7 2460      His word was still
7 2461 
7 2462           Fie, foh, and fum!
7 2463           I smell the blood of a British man.
7 2464                                                          Exeunt.
7 2465 
7 2466 Scene V.
7 2467 Gloucester's Castle.
7 2468 
7 2469 Enter Cornwall and Edmund.
7 2470 
7 2471   Corn. I will have my revenge ere I depart his house.
7 2472   Edm. How, my lord, I may be censured, that nature thus gives
7 2473 way to
7 2474      loyalty, something fears me to think of.
7 2475   Corn. I now perceive it was not altogether your brother's evil
7 2476      disposition made him seek his death; but a provoking merit,
7 2477 set
7 2478      awork by a reproveable badness in himself.
7 2479   Edm. How malicious is my fortune that I must repent to be just!
7 2480      This is the letter he spoke of, which approves him an
7 2481      intelligent party to the advantages of France. O heavens!
7 2482 that
7 2483      this treason were not- or not I the detector!
7 2484   Corn. Go with me to the Duchess.
7 2485   Edm. If the matter of this paper be certain, you have mighty
7 2486      business in hand.
7 2487   Corn. True or false, it hath made thee Earl of Gloucester.
7 2488      Seek out where thy father is, that he may be ready for our
7 2489      apprehension.
7 2490   Edm. [aside] If I find him comforting the King, it will stuff
7 2491 his 
7 2492      suspicion more fully.- I will persever in my course of
7 2493 loyalty,
7 2494      though the conflict be sore between that and my blood.
7 2495   Corn. I will lay trust upon thee, and thou shalt find a dearer
7 2496      father in my love.
7 2497                                                          Exeunt.

7 2501 
7 2502 Scene VI.
7 2503 A farmhouse near Gloucester's Castle.
7 2504 
7 2505 Enter Gloucester, Lear, Kent, Fool, and Edgar.
7 2506 
7 2507   Glou. Here is better than the open air; take it thankfully. I
7 2508 will
7 2509      piece out the comfort with what addition I can. I will not
7 2510 be
7 2511      long from you.
7 2512   Kent. All the power of his wits have given way to his
7 2513 impatience.
7 2514      The gods reward your kindness!
7 2515                                               Exit [Gloucester].
7 2516   Edg. Frateretto calls me, and tells me Nero is an angler in the
7 2517      lake of darkness. Pray, innocent, and beware the foul fiend.
7 2518   Fool. Prithee, nuncle, tell me whether a madman be a gentleman
7 2519 or a
7 2520      yeoman.
7 2521   Lear. A king, a king!
7 2522   Fool. No, he's a yeoman that has a gentleman to his son; for
7 2523 he's a
7 2524      mad yeoman that sees his son a gentleman before him.
7 2525   Lear. To have a thousand with red burning spits
7 2526      Come hizzing in upon 'em-
7 2527   Edg. The foul fiend bites my back.
7 2528   Fool. He's mad that trusts in the tameness of a wolf, a horse's
7 2529      health, a boy's love, or a whore's oath. 
7 2530   Lear. It shall be done; I will arraign them straight.
7 2531      [To Edgar] Come, sit thou here, most learned justicer.
7 2532      [To the Fool] Thou, sapient sir, sit here. Now, you
7 2533 she-foxes!
7 2534   Edg. Look, where he stands and glares! Want'st thou eyes at
7 2535 trial,
7 2536      madam?
7 2537 
7 2538              Come o'er the bourn, Bessy, to me.
7 2539 
7 2540   Fool.      Her boat hath a leak,
7 2541              And she must not speak
7 2542            Why she dares not come over to thee.
7 2543 
7 2544   Edg. The foul fiend haunts poor Tom in the voice of a
7 2545 nightingale.
7 2546      Hoppedance cries in Tom's belly for two white herring. Croak
7 2547      not, black angel; I have no food for thee.
7 2548   Kent. How do you, sir? Stand you not so amaz'd.
7 2549      Will you lie down and rest upon the cushions?
7 2550   Lear. I'll see their trial first. Bring in their evidence.
7 2551      [To Edgar] Thou, robed man of justice, take thy place.
7 2552      [To the Fool] And thou, his yokefellow of equity, 
7 2553      Bench by his side. [To Kent] You are o' th' commission,
7 2554      Sit you too.
7 2555   Edg. Let us deal justly.
7 2556 
7 2557           Sleepest or wakest thou, jolly shepherd?
7 2558             Thy sheep be in the corn;
7 2559           And for one blast of thy minikin mouth
7 2560             Thy sheep shall take no harm.
7 2561 
7 2562      Purr! the cat is gray.
7 2563   Lear. Arraign her first. 'Tis Goneril. I here take my oath
7 2564 before
7 2565      this honourable assembly, she kicked the poor King her
7 2566 father.
7 2567   Fool. Come hither, mistress. Is your name Goneril?
7 2568   Lear. She cannot deny it.
7 2569   Fool. Cry you mercy, I took you for a joint-stool.
7 2570   Lear. And here's another, whose warp'd looks proclaim
7 2571      What store her heart is made on. Stop her there!
7 2572      Arms, arms! sword! fire! Corruption in the place!
7 2573      False justicer, why hast thou let her scape?
7 2574   Edg. Bless thy five wits! 
7 2575   Kent. O pity! Sir, where is the patience now
7 2576      That you so oft have boasted to retain?
7 2577   Edg. [aside] My tears begin to take his part so much
7 2578      They'll mar my counterfeiting.
7 2579   Lear. The little dogs and all,
7 2580      Tray, Blanch, and Sweetheart, see, they bark at me.
7 2581   Edg. Tom will throw his head at them. Avaunt, you curs!
7 2582            Be thy mouth or black or white,
7 2583            Tooth that poisons if it bite;
7 2584            Mastiff, greyhound, mongrel grim,
7 2585            Hound or spaniel, brach or lym,
7 2586            Bobtail tyke or trundle-tall-
7 2587            Tom will make them weep and wail;
7 2588            For, with throwing thus my head,
7 2589            Dogs leap the hatch, and all are fled.
7 2590      Do de, de, de. Sessa! Come, march to wakes and fairs and
7 2591 market
7 2592      towns. Poor Tom, thy horn is dry.
7 2593   Lear. Then let them anatomize Regan. See what breeds about her
7 2594      heart. Is there any cause in nature that makes these hard
7 2595      hearts? [To Edgar] You, sir- I entertain you for one of my 
7 2596      hundred; only I do not like the fashion of your garments.
7 2597 You'll
7 2598      say they are Persian attire; but let them be chang'd.
7 2599   Kent. Now, good my lord, lie here and rest awhile.
7 2600   Lear. Make no noise, make no noise; draw the curtains.
7 2601      So, so, so. We'll go to supper i' th' morning. So, so, so.
7 2602   Fool. And I'll go to bed at noon.
7 2603 
7 2604                           Enter Gloucester.
7 2605 
7 2606   Glou. Come hither, friend. Where is the King my master?
7 2607   Kent. Here, sir; but trouble him not; his wits are gone.
7 2608   Glou. Good friend, I prithee take him in thy arms.
7 2609      I have o'erheard a plot of death upon him.
7 2610      There is a litter ready; lay him in't
7 2611      And drive towards Dover, friend, where thou shalt meet
7 2612      Both welcome and protection. Take up thy master.
7 2613      If thou shouldst dally half an hour, his life,
7 2614      With thine, and all that offer to defend him,
7 2615      Stand in assured loss. Take up, take up!
7 2616      And follow me, that will to some provision 
7 2617      Give thee quick conduct.
7 2618   Kent. Oppressed nature sleeps.
7 2619      This rest might yet have balm'd thy broken senses,
7 2620      Which, if convenience will not allow,
7 2621      Stand in hard cure. [To the Fool] Come, help to bear thy
7 2622 master.
7 2623      Thou must not stay behind.
7 2624   Glou. Come, come, away!
7 2625                                          Exeunt [all but Edgar].
7 2626   Edg. When we our betters see bearing our woes,
7 2627      We scarcely think our miseries our foes.
7 2628      Who alone suffers suffers most i' th' mind,
7 2629      Leaving free things and happy shows behind;
7 2630      But then the mind much sufferance doth o'erskip
7 2631      When grief hath mates, and bearing fellowship.
7 2632      How light and portable my pain seems now,
7 2633      When that which makes me bend makes the King bow,
7 2634      He childed as I fathered! Tom, away!
7 2635      Mark the high noises, and thyself bewray
7 2636      When false opinion, whose wrong thought defiles thee,
7 2637      In thy just proof repeals and reconciles thee. 
7 2638      What will hap more to-night, safe scape the King!
7 2639      Lurk, lurk.                                         [Exit.]

7 2644 Scene VII.
7 2645 Gloucester's Castle.
7 2646 
7 2647 Enter Cornwall, Regan, Goneril, [Edmund the] Bastard, and
7 2648 Servants.
7 2649 
7 2650   Corn. [to Goneril] Post speedily to my lord your husband, show
7 2651 him
7 2652      this letter. The army of France is landed.- Seek out the
7 2653 traitor
7 2654      Gloucester.
7 2655                                   [Exeunt some of the Servants.]
7 2656   Reg. Hang him instantly.
7 2657   Gon. Pluck out his eyes.
7 2658   Corn. Leave him to my displeasure. Edmund, keep you our sister
7 2659      company. The revenges we are bound to take upon your
7 2660 traitorous
7 2661      father are not fit for your beholding. Advise the Duke where
7 2662 you
7 2663      are going, to a most festinate preparation. We are bound to
7 2664 the
7 2665      like. Our posts shall be swift and intelligent betwixt us.
7 2666      Farewell, dear sister; farewell, my Lord of Gloucester.
7 2667 
7 2668                      Enter [Oswald the] Steward.
7 2669 
7 2670      How now? Where's the King? 
7 2671   Osw. My Lord of Gloucester hath convey'd him hence.
7 2672      Some five or six and thirty of his knights,
7 2673      Hot questrists after him, met him at gate;
7 2674      Who, with some other of the lord's dependants,
7 2675      Are gone with him towards Dover, where they boast
7 2676      To have well-armed friends.
7 2677   Corn. Get horses for your mistress.
7 2678   Gon. Farewell, sweet lord, and sister.
7 2679   Corn. Edmund, farewell.
7 2680                            Exeunt Goneril, [Edmund, and Oswald].
7 2681      Go seek the traitor Gloucester,
7 2682      Pinion him like a thief, bring him before us.
7 2683                                         [Exeunt other Servants.]
7 2684      Though well we may not pass upon his life
7 2685      Without the form of justice, yet our power
7 2686      Shall do a court'sy to our wrath, which men
7 2687      May blame, but not control.
7 2688 
7 2689             Enter Gloucester, brought in by two or three.
7 2690  
7 2691      Who's there? the traitor?
7 2692   Reg. Ingrateful fox! 'tis he.
7 2693   Corn. Bind fast his corky arms.
7 2694   Glou. What mean, your Graces? Good my friends, consider
7 2695      You are my guests. Do me no foul play, friends.
7 2696   Corn. Bind him, I say.
7 2697                                             [Servants bind him.]
7 2698   Reg. Hard, hard. O filthy traitor!
7 2699   Glou. Unmerciful lady as you are, I am none.
7 2700   Corn. To this chair bind him. Villain, thou shalt find-
7 2701                                        [Regan plucks his beard.]
7 2702   Glou. By the kind gods, 'tis most ignobly done
7 2703      To pluck me by the beard.
7 2704   Reg. So white, and such a traitor!
7 2705   Glou. Naughty lady,
7 2706      These hairs which thou dost ravish from my chin
7 2707      Will quicken, and accuse thee. I am your host.
7 2708      With robber's hands my hospitable favours
7 2709      You should not ruffle thus. What will you do?
7 2710   Corn. Come, sir, what letters had you late from France? 
7 2711   Reg. Be simple-answer'd, for we know the truth.
7 2712   Corn. And what confederacy have you with the traitors
7 2713      Late footed in the kingdom?
7 2714   Reg. To whose hands have you sent the lunatic King?
7 2715      Speak.
7 2716   Glou. I have a letter guessingly set down,
7 2717      Which came from one that's of a neutral heart,
7 2718      And not from one oppos'd.
7 2719   Corn. Cunning.
7 2720   Reg. And false.
7 2721   Corn. Where hast thou sent the King?
7 2722   Glou. To Dover.
7 2723   Reg. Wherefore to Dover? Wast thou not charg'd at peril-
7 2724   Corn. Wherefore to Dover? Let him first answer that.
7 2725   Glou. I am tied to th' stake, and I must stand the course.
7 2726   Reg. Wherefore to Dover, sir?
7 2727   Glou. Because I would not see thy cruel nails
7 2728      Pluck out his poor old eyes; nor thy fierce sister
7 2729      In his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs.
7 2730      The sea, with such a storm as his bare head 
7 2731      In hell-black night endur'd, would have buoy'd up
7 2732      And quench'd the steeled fires.
7 2733      Yet, poor old heart, he holp the heavens to rain.
7 2734      If wolves had at thy gate howl'd that stern time,
7 2735      Thou shouldst have said, 'Good porter, turn the key.'
7 2736      All cruels else subscrib'd. But I shall see
7 2737      The winged vengeance overtake such children.
7 2738   Corn. See't shalt thou never. Fellows, hold the chair.
7 2739      Upon these eyes of thine I'll set my foot.
7 2740   Glou. He that will think to live till he be old,
7 2741      Give me some help!- O cruel! O ye gods!
7 2742   Reg. One side will mock another. Th' other too!
7 2743   Corn. If you see vengeance-
7 2744   1. Serv. Hold your hand, my lord!
7 2745      I have serv'd you ever since I was a child;
7 2746      But better service have I never done you
7 2747      Than now to bid you hold.
7 2748   Reg. How now, you dog?
7 2749   1. Serv. If you did wear a beard upon your chin,
7 2750      I'ld shake it on this quarrel. 
7 2751   Reg. What do you mean?
7 2752   Corn. My villain!                               Draw and fight.
7 2753   1. Serv. Nay, then, come on, and take the chance of anger.
7 2754   Reg. Give me thy sword. A peasant stand up thus?
7 2755                         She takes a sword and runs at him behind.
7 2756   1. Serv. O, I am slain! My lord, you have one eye left
7 2757      To see some mischief on him. O!                     He dies.
7 2758   Corn. Lest it see more, prevent it. Out, vile jelly!
7 2759      Where is thy lustre now?
7 2760   Glou. All dark and comfortless! Where's my son Edmund?
7 2761      Edmund, enkindle all the sparks of nature
7 2762      To quit this horrid act.
7 2763   Reg. Out, treacherous villain!
7 2764      Thou call'st on him that hates thee. It was he
7 2765      That made the overture of thy treasons to us;
7 2766      Who is too good to pity thee.
7 2767   Glou. O my follies! Then Edgar was abus'd.
7 2768      Kind gods, forgive me that, and prosper him!
7 2769   Reg. Go thrust him out at gates, and let him smell
7 2770      His way to Dover. 
7 2771                                      Exit [one] with Gloucester.
7 2772      How is't, my lord? How look you?
7 2773   Corn. I have receiv'd a hurt. Follow me, lady.
7 2774      Turn out that eyeless villain. Throw this slave
7 2775      Upon the dunghill. Regan, I bleed apace.
7 2776      Untimely comes this hurt. Give me your arm.
7 2777                                   Exit [Cornwall, led by Regan].
7 2778   2. Serv. I'll never care what wickedness I do,
7 2779      If this man come to good.
7 2780   3. Serv. If she live long,
7 2781      And in the end meet the old course of death,
7 2782      Women will all turn monsters.
7 2783   2. Serv. Let's follow the old Earl, and get the bedlam
7 2784      To lead him where he would. His roguish madness
7 2785      Allows itself to anything.
7 2786   3. Serv. Go thou. I'll fetch some flax and whites of eggs
7 2787      To apply to his bleeding face. Now heaven help him!
7 2788                                                          Exeunt.

7 2804 ACT IV. Scene I.
7 2805 The heath.
7 2806 
7 2807 Enter Edgar.
7 2808 
7 2809   Edg. Yet better thus, and known to be contemn'd,
7 2810      Than still contemn'd and flatter'd. To be worst,
7 2811      The lowest and most dejected thing of fortune,
7 2812      Stands still in esperance, lives not in fear.
7 2813      The lamentable change is from the best;
7 2814      The worst returns to laughter. Welcome then,
7 2815      Thou unsubstantial air that I embrace!
7 2816      The wretch that thou hast blown unto the worst
7 2817      Owes nothing to thy blasts.
7 2818 
7 2819                  Enter Gloucester, led by an Old Man.
7 2820 
7 2821      But who comes here?
7 2822      My father, poorly led? World, world, O world!
7 2823      But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee,
7 2824      Life would not yield to age.
7 2825   Old Man. O my good lord, 
7 2826      I have been your tenant, and your father's tenant,
7 2827      These fourscore years.
7 2828   Glou. Away, get thee away! Good friend, be gone.
7 2829      Thy comforts can do me no good at all;
7 2830      Thee they may hurt.
7 2831   Old Man. You cannot see your way.
7 2832   Glou. I have no way, and therefore want no eyes;
7 2833      I stumbled when I saw. Full oft 'tis seen
7 2834      Our means secure us, and our mere defects
7 2835      Prove our commodities. Ah dear son Edgar,
7 2836      The food of thy abused father's wrath!
7 2837      Might I but live to see thee in my touch,
7 2838      I'ld say I had eyes again!
7 2839   Old Man. How now? Who's there?
7 2840   Edg. [aside] O gods! Who is't can say 'I am at the worst'?
7 2841      I am worse than e'er I was.
7 2842   Old Man. 'Tis poor mad Tom.
7 2843   Edg. [aside] And worse I may be yet. The worst is not
7 2844      So long as we can say 'This is the worst.'
7 2845   Old Man. Fellow, where goest? 
7 2846   Glou. Is it a beggarman?
7 2847   Old Man. Madman and beggar too.
7 2848   Glou. He has some reason, else he could not beg.
7 2849      I' th' last night's storm I such a fellow saw,
7 2850      Which made me think a man a worm. My son
7 2851      Came then into my mind, and yet my mind
7 2852      Was then scarce friends with him. I have heard more since.
7 2853      As flies to wanton boys are we to th' gods.
7 2854      They kill us for their sport.
7 2855   Edg. [aside] How should this be?
7 2856      Bad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow,
7 2857      Ang'ring itself and others.- Bless thee, master!
7 2858   Glou. Is that the naked fellow?
7 2859   Old Man. Ay, my lord.
7 2860   Glou. Then prithee get thee gone. If for my sake
7 2861      Thou wilt o'ertake us hence a mile or twain
7 2862      I' th' way toward Dover, do it for ancient love;
7 2863      And bring some covering for this naked soul,
7 2864      Who I'll entreat to lead me.
7 2865   Old Man. Alack, sir, he is mad! 
7 2866   Glou. 'Tis the time's plague when madmen lead the blind.
7 2867      Do as I bid thee, or rather do thy pleasure.
7 2868      Above the rest, be gone.
7 2869   Old Man. I'll bring him the best 'parel that I have,
7 2870      Come on't what will.                                  Exit.
7 2871   Glou. Sirrah naked fellow-
7 2872   Edg. Poor Tom's acold. [Aside] I cannot daub it further.
7 2873   Glou. Come hither, fellow.
7 2874   Edg. [aside] And yet I must.- Bless thy sweet eyes, they bleed.
7 2875   Glou. Know'st thou the way to Dover?
7 2876   Edg. Both stile and gate, horseway and footpath. Poor Tom hath
7 2877 been
7 2878      scar'd out of his good wits. Bless thee, good man's son,
7 2879 from
7 2880      the foul fiend! Five fiends have been in poor Tom at once:
7 2881 of
7 2882      lust, as Obidicut; Hobbididence, prince of dumbness; Mahu,
7 2883 of
7 2884      stealing; Modo, of murder; Flibbertigibbet, of mopping and
7 2885      mowing, who since possesses chambermaids and waiting women.
7 2886 So,
7 2887      bless thee, master!
7 2888   Glou. Here, take this Purse, thou whom the heavens' plagues
7 2889      Have humbled to all strokes. That I am wretched
7 2890      Makes thee the happier. Heavens, deal so still! 
7 2891      Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man,
7 2892      That slaves your ordinance, that will not see
7 2893      Because he does not feel, feel your pow'r quickly;
7 2894      So distribution should undo excess,
7 2895      And each man have enough. Dost thou know Dover?
7 2896   Edg. Ay, master.
7 2897   Glou. There is a cliff, whose high and bending head
7 2898      Looks fearfully in the confined deep.
7 2899      Bring me but to the very brim of it,
7 2900      And I'll repair the misery thou dost bear
7 2901      With something rich about me. From that place
7 2902      I shall no leading need.
7 2903   Edg. Give me thy arm.
7 2904      Poor Tom shall lead thee.
7 2905                                                          Exeunt.

7 2910 Scene II.
7 2911 Before the Duke of Albany's Palace.
7 2912 
7 2913 Enter Goneril and [Edmund the] Bastard.
7 2914 
7 2915   Gon. Welcome, my lord. I marvel our mild husband
7 2916      Not met us on the way.
7 2917 
7 2918                      Enter [Oswald the] Steward.
7 2919 
7 2920      Now, where's your master?
7 2921   Osw. Madam, within, but never man so chang'd.
7 2922      I told him of the army that was landed:
7 2923      He smil'd at it. I told him you were coming:
7 2924      His answer was, 'The worse.' Of Gloucester's treachery
7 2925      And of the loyal service of his son
7 2926      When I inform'd him, then he call'd me sot
7 2927      And told me I had turn'd the wrong side out.
7 2928      What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him;
7 2929      What like, offensive.
7 2930   Gon. [to Edmund] Then shall you go no further.
7 2931      It is the cowish terror of his spirit, 
7 2932      That dares not undertake. He'll not feel wrongs
7 2933      Which tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the way
7 2934      May prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother.
7 2935      Hasten his musters and conduct his pow'rs.
7 2936      I must change arms at home and give the distaff
7 2937      Into my husband's hands. This trusty servant
7 2938      Shall pass between us. Ere long you are like to hear
7 2939      (If you dare venture in your own behalf)
7 2940      A mistress's command. Wear this.          [Gives a favour.]
7 2941      Spare speech.
7 2942      Decline your head. This kiss, if it durst speak,
7 2943      Would stretch thy spirits up into the air.
7 2944      Conceive, and fare thee well.
7 2945   Edm. Yours in the ranks of death!                        Exit.
7 2946   Gon. My most dear Gloucester!
7 2947      O, the difference of man and man!
7 2948      To thee a woman's services are due;
7 2949      My fool usurps my body.
7 2950   Osw. Madam, here comes my lord.                          Exit.
7 2951  
7 2952                             Enter Albany.
7 2953 
7 2954   Gon. I have been worth the whistle.
7 2955   Alb. O Goneril,
7 2956      You are not worth the dust which the rude wind
7 2957      Blows in your face! I fear your disposition.
7 2958      That nature which contemns it origin
7 2959      Cannot be bordered certain in itself.
7 2960      She that herself will sliver and disbranch
7 2961      From her material sap, perforce must wither
7 2962      And come to deadly use.
7 2963   Gon. No more! The text is foolish.
7 2964   Alb. Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile;
7 2965      Filths savour but themselves. What have you done?
7 2966      Tigers, not daughters, what have you perform'd?
7 2967      A father, and a gracious aged man,
7 2968      Whose reverence even the head-lugg'd bear would lick,
7 2969      Most barbarous, most degenerate, have you madded.
7 2970      Could my good brother suffer you to do it?
7 2971      A man, a prince, by him so benefited! 
7 2972      If that the heavens do not their visible spirits
7 2973      Send quickly down to tame these vile offences,
7 2974      It will come,
7 2975      Humanity must perforce prey on itself,
7 2976      Like monsters of the deep.
7 2977   Gon. Milk-liver'd man!
7 2978      That bear'st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs;
7 2979      Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning
7 2980      Thine honour from thy suffering; that not know'st
7 2981      Fools do those villains pity who are punish'd
7 2982      Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
7 2983      France spreads his banners in our noiseless land,
7 2984      With plumed helm thy state begins to threat,
7 2985      Whiles thou, a moral fool, sit'st still, and criest
7 2986      'Alack, why does he so?'
7 2987   Alb. See thyself, devil!
7 2988      Proper deformity seems not in the fiend
7 2989      So horrid as in woman.
7 2990   Gon. O vain fool!
7 2991   Alb. Thou changed and self-cover'd thing, for shame! 
7 2992      Bemonster not thy feature! Were't my fitness
7 2993      To let these hands obey my blood,
7 2994      They are apt enough to dislocate and tear
7 2995      Thy flesh and bones. Howe'er thou art a fiend,
7 2996      A woman's shape doth shield thee.
7 2997   Gon. Marry, your manhood mew!
7 2998 
7 2999                           Enter a Gentleman.
7 3000 
7 3001   Alb. What news?
7 3002   Gent. O, my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall 's dead,
7 3003      Slain by his servant, going to put out
7 3004      The other eye of Gloucester.
7 3005   Alb. Gloucester's eyes?
7 3006   Gent. A servant that he bred, thrill'd with remorse,
7 3007      Oppos'd against the act, bending his sword
7 3008      To his great master; who, thereat enrag'd,
7 3009      Flew on him, and amongst them fell'd him dead;
7 3010      But not without that harmful stroke which since
7 3011      Hath pluck'd him after. 
7 3012   Alb. This shows you are above,
7 3013      You justicers, that these our nether crimes
7 3014      So speedily can venge! But O poor Gloucester!
7 3015      Lose he his other eye?
7 3016   Gent. Both, both, my lord.
7 3017      This letter, madam, craves a speedy answer.
7 3018      'Tis from your sister.
7 3019   Gon. [aside] One way I like this well;
7 3020      But being widow, and my Gloucester with her,
7 3021      May all the building in my fancy pluck
7 3022      Upon my hateful life. Another way
7 3023      The news is not so tart.- I'll read, and answer.
7 3024 Exit.
7 3025   Alb. Where was his son when they did take his eyes?
7 3026   Gent. Come with my lady hither.
7 3027   Alb. He is not here.
7 3028   Gent. No, my good lord; I met him back again.
7 3029   Alb. Knows he the wickedness?
7 3030   Gent. Ay, my good lord. 'Twas he inform'd against him,
7 3031      And quit the house on purpose, that their punishment 
7 3032      Might have the freer course.
7 3033   Alb. Gloucester, I live
7 3034      To thank thee for the love thou show'dst the King,
7 3035      And to revenge thine eyes. Come hither, friend.
7 3036      Tell me what more thou know'st.
7 3037                                                          Exeunt.

7 3042 Scene III.
7 3043 The French camp near Dover.
7 3044 
7 3045 Enter Kent and a Gentleman.
7 3046 
7 3047   Kent. Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back know you
7 3048 the
7 3049      reason?
7 3050   Gent. Something he left imperfect in the state, which since his
7 3051      coming forth is thought of, which imports to the kingdom so
7 3052 much
7 3053      fear and danger that his personal return was most required
7 3054 and
7 3055      necessary.
7 3056   Kent. Who hath he left behind him general?
7 3057   Gent. The Marshal of France, Monsieur La Far.
7 3058   Kent. Did your letters pierce the Queen to any demonstration of
7 3059      grief?
7 3060   Gent. Ay, sir. She took them, read them in my presence,
7 3061      And now and then an ample tear trill'd down
7 3062      Her delicate cheek. It seem'd she was a queen
7 3063      Over her passion, who, most rebel-like,
7 3064      Sought to be king o'er her.
7 3065   Kent. O, then it mov'd her?
7 3066   Gent. Not to a rage. Patience and sorrow strove 
7 3067      Who should express her goodliest. You have seen
7 3068      Sunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tears
7 3069      Were like, a better way. Those happy smilets
7 3070      That play'd on her ripe lip seem'd not to know
7 3071      What guests were in her eyes, which parted thence
7 3072      As pearls from diamonds dropp'd. In brief,
7 3073      Sorrow would be a rarity most belov'd,
7 3074      If all could so become it.
7 3075   Kent. Made she no verbal question?
7 3076   Gent. Faith, once or twice she heav'd the name of father
7 3077      Pantingly forth, as if it press'd her heart;
7 3078      Cried 'Sisters, sisters! Shame of ladies! Sisters!
7 3079      Kent! father! sisters! What, i' th' storm? i' th' night?
7 3080      Let pity not be believ'd!' There she shook
7 3081      The holy water from her heavenly eyes,
7 3082      And clamour moisten'd. Then away she started
7 3083      To deal with grief alone.
7 3084   Kent. It is the stars,
7 3085      The stars above us, govern our conditions;
7 3086      Else one self mate and mate could not beget 
7 3087      Such different issues. You spoke not with her since?
7 3088   Gent. No.
7 3089   Kent. Was this before the King return'd?
7 3090   Gent. No, since.
7 3091   Kent. Well, sir, the poor distressed Lear's i' th' town;
7 3092      Who sometime, in his better tune, remembers
7 3093      What we are come about, and by no means
7 3094      Will yield to see his daughter.
7 3095   Gent. Why, good sir?
7 3096   Kent. A sovereign shame so elbows him; his own unkindness,
7 3097      That stripp'd her from his benediction, turn'd her
7 3098      To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights
7 3099      To his dog-hearted daughters- these things sting
7 3100      His mind so venomously that burning shame
7 3101      Detains him from Cordelia.
7 3102   Gent. Alack, poor gentleman!
7 3103   Kent. Of Albany's and Cornwall's powers you heard not?
7 3104   Gent. 'Tis so; they are afoot.
7 3105   Kent. Well, sir, I'll bring you to our master Lear
7 3106      And leave you to attend him. Some dear cause 
7 3107      Will in concealment wrap me up awhile.
7 3108      When I am known aright, you shall not grieve
7 3109      Lending me this acquaintance. I pray you go
7 3110      Along with me.                                      Exeunt.

7 3116 The French camp.
7 3117 
7 3118 Enter, with Drum and Colours, Cordelia, Doctor, and Soldiers.
7 3119 
7 3120   Cor. Alack, 'tis he! Why, he was met even now
7 3121      As mad as the vex'd sea, singing aloud,
7 3122      Crown'd with rank fumiter and furrow weeds,
7 3123      With hardocks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo flow'rs,
7 3124      Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow
7 3125      In our sustaining corn. A century send forth.
7 3126      Search every acre in the high-grown field
7 3127      And bring him to our eye. [Exit an Officer.] What can man's
7 3128         wisdom
7 3129      In the restoring his bereaved sense?
7 3130      He that helps him take all my outward worth.
7 3131   Doct. There is means, madam.
7 3132      Our foster nurse of nature is repose,
7 3133      The which he lacks. That to provoke in him
7 3134      Are many simples operative, whose power
7 3135      Will close the eye of anguish.
7 3136   Cor. All blest secrets, 
7 3137      All you unpublish'd virtues of the earth,
7 3138      Spring with my tears! be aidant and remediate
7 3139      In the good man's distress! Seek, seek for him!
7 3140      Lest his ungovern'd rage dissolve the life
7 3141      That wants the means to lead it.
7 3142 
7 3143                            Enter Messenger.
7 3144 
7 3145   Mess. News, madam.
7 3146      The British pow'rs are marching hitherward.
7 3147   Cor. 'Tis known before. Our preparation stands
7 3148      In expectation of them. O dear father,
7 3149      It is thy business that I go about.
7 3150      Therefore great France
7 3151      My mourning and important tears hath pitied.
7 3152      No blown ambition doth our arms incite,
7 3153      But love, dear love, and our ag'd father's right.
7 3154      Soon may I hear and see him!
7 3155                                                          Exeunt.

7 3160 Scene V.
7 3161 Gloucester's Castle.
7 3162 
7 3163 Enter Regan and [Oswald the] Steward.
7 3164 
7 3165   Reg. But are my brother's pow'rs set forth?
7 3166   Osw. Ay, madam.
7 3167   Reg. Himself in person there?
7 3168   Osw. Madam, with much ado.
7 3169      Your sister is the better soldier.
7 3170   Reg. Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?
7 3171   Osw. No, madam.
7 3172   Reg. What might import my sister's letter to him?
7 3173   Osw. I know not, lady.
7 3174   Reg. Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter.
7 3175      It was great ignorance, Gloucester's eyes being out,
7 3176      To let him live. Where he arrives he moves
7 3177      All hearts against us. Edmund, I think, is gone,
7 3178      In pity of his misery, to dispatch
7 3179      His nighted life; moreover, to descry
7 3180      The strength o' th' enemy.
7 3181   Osw. I must needs after him, madam, with my letter. 
7 3182   Reg. Our troops set forth to-morrow. Stay with us.
7 3183      The ways are dangerous.
7 3184   Osw. I may not, madam.
7 3185      My lady charg'd my duty in this business.
7 3186   Reg. Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you
7 3187      Transport her purposes by word? Belike,
7 3188      Something- I know not what- I'll love thee much-
7 3189      Let me unseal the letter.
7 3190   Osw. Madam, I had rather-
7 3191   Reg. I know your lady does not love her husband;
7 3192      I am sure of that; and at her late being here
7 3193      She gave strange eliads and most speaking looks
7 3194      To noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom.
7 3195   Osw. I, madam?
7 3196   Reg. I speak in understanding. Y'are! I know't.
7 3197      Therefore I do advise you take this note.
7 3198      My lord is dead; Edmund and I have talk'd,
7 3199      And more convenient is he for my hand
7 3200      Than for your lady's. You may gather more.
7 3201      If you do find him, pray you give him this; 
7 3202      And when your mistress hears thus much from you,
7 3203      I pray desire her call her wisdom to her.
7 3204      So farewell.
7 3205      If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,
7 3206      Preferment falls on him that cuts him off.
7 3207   Osw. Would I could meet him, madam! I should show
7 3208      What party I do follow.
7 3209   Reg. Fare thee well.                                   Exeunt.

7 3214 Scene VI.
7 3215 The country near Dover.
7 3216 
7 3217 Enter Gloucester, and Edgar [like a Peasant].
7 3218 
7 3219   Glou. When shall I come to th' top of that same hill?
7 3220   Edg. You do climb up it now. Look how we labour.
7 3221   Glou. Methinks the ground is even.
7 3222   Edg. Horrible steep.
7 3223      Hark, do you hear the sea?
7 3224   Glou. No, truly.
7 3225   Edg. Why, then, your other senses grow imperfect
7 3226      By your eyes' anguish.
7 3227   Glou. So may it be indeed.
7 3228      Methinks thy voice is alter'd, and thou speak'st
7 3229      In better phrase and matter than thou didst.
7 3230   Edg. Y'are much deceiv'd. In nothing am I chang'd
7 3231      But in my garments.
7 3232   Glou. Methinks y'are better spoken.
7 3233   Edg. Come on, sir; here's the place. Stand still. How fearful
7 3234      And dizzy 'tis to cast one's eyes so low!
7 3235      The crows and choughs that wing the midway air 
7 3236      Show scarce so gross as beetles. Halfway down
7 3237      Hangs one that gathers sampire- dreadful trade!
7 3238      Methinks he seems no bigger than his head.
7 3239      The fishermen that walk upon the beach
7 3240      Appear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark,
7 3241      Diminish'd to her cock; her cock, a buoy
7 3242      Almost too small for sight. The murmuring surge
7 3243      That on th' unnumb'red idle pebble chafes
7 3244      Cannot be heard so high. I'll look no more,
7 3245      Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight
7 3246      Topple down headlong.
7 3247   Glou. Set me where you stand.
7 3248   Edg. Give me your hand. You are now within a foot
7 3249      Of th' extreme verge. For all beneath the moon
7 3250      Would I not leap upright.
7 3251   Glou. Let go my hand.
7 3252      Here, friend, is another purse; in it a jewel
7 3253      Well worth a poor man's taking. Fairies and gods
7 3254      Prosper it with thee! Go thou further off;
7 3255      Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going. 
7 3256   Edg. Now fare ye well, good sir.
7 3257   Glou. With all my heart.
7 3258   Edg. [aside]. Why I do trifle thus with his despair
7 3259      Is done to cure it.
7 3260   Glou. O you mighty gods!                            He kneels.
7 3261      This world I do renounce, and, in your sights,
7 3262      Shake patiently my great affliction off.
7 3263      If I could bear it longer and not fall
7 3264      To quarrel with your great opposeless wills,
7 3265      My snuff and loathed part of nature should
7 3266      Burn itself out. If Edgar live, O, bless him!
7 3267      Now, fellow, fare thee well.
7 3268                                   He falls [forward and swoons].
7 3269   Edg. Gone, sir, farewell.-
7 3270      And yet I know not how conceit may rob
7 3271      The treasury of life when life itself
7 3272      Yields to the theft. Had he been where he thought,
7 3273      By this had thought been past.- Alive or dead?
7 3274      Ho you, sir! friend! Hear you, sir? Speak!-
7 3275      Thus might he pass indeed. Yet he revives. 
7 3276      What are you, sir?
7 3277   Glou. Away, and let me die.
7 3278   Edg. Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,
7 3279      So many fadom down precipitating,
7 3280      Thou'dst shiver'd like an egg; but thou dost breathe;
7 3281      Hast heavy substance; bleed'st not; speak'st; art sound.
7 3282      Ten masts at each make not the altitude
7 3283      Which thou hast perpendicularly fell.
7 3284      Thy life is a miracle. Speak yet again.
7 3285   Glou. But have I fall'n, or no?
7 3286   Edg. From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.
7 3287      Look up a-height. The shrill-gorg'd lark so far
7 3288      Cannot be seen or heard. Do but look up.
7 3289   Glou. Alack, I have no eyes!
7 3290      Is wretchedness depriv'd that benefit
7 3291      To end itself by death? 'Twas yet some comfort
7 3292      When misery could beguile the tyrant's rage
7 3293      And frustrate his proud will.
7 3294   Edg. Give me your arm.
7 3295      Up- so. How is't? Feel you your legs? You stand. 
7 3296   Glou. Too well, too well.
7 3297   Edg. This is above all strangeness.
7 3298      Upon the crown o' th' cliff what thing was that
7 3299      Which parted from you?
7 3300   Glou. A poor unfortunate beggar.
7 3301   Edg. As I stood here below, methought his eyes
7 3302      Were two full moons; he had a thousand noses,
7 3303      Horns whelk'd and wav'd like the enridged sea.
7 3304      It was some fiend. Therefore, thou happy father,
7 3305      Think that the clearest gods, who make them honours
7 3306      Of men's impossibility, have preserv'd thee.
7 3307   Glou. I do remember now. Henceforth I'll bear
7 3308      Affliction till it do cry out itself
7 3309      'Enough, enough,' and die. That thing you speak of,
7 3310      I took it for a man. Often 'twould say
7 3311      'The fiend, the fiend'- he led me to that place.
7 3312   Edg. Bear free and patient thoughts.
7 3313 
7 3314          Enter Lear, mad, [fantastically dressed with weeds].
7 3315  
7 3316      But who comes here?
7 3317      The safer sense will ne'er accommodate
7 3318      His master thus.
7 3319   Lear. No, they cannot touch me for coming;
7 3320      I am the King himself.
7 3321   Edg. O thou side-piercing sight!
7 3322   Lear. Nature 's above art in that respect. There's your press
7 3323      money. That fellow handles his bow like a crow-keeper. Draw
7 3324 me
7 3325      a clothier's yard. Look, look, a mouse! Peace, peace; this
7 3326 piece
7 3327      of toasted cheese will do't. There's my gauntlet; I'll prove
7 3328 it
7 3329      on a giant. Bring up the brown bills. O, well flown, bird!
7 3330 i'
7 3331      th' clout, i' th' clout! Hewgh! Give the word.
7 3332   Edg. Sweet marjoram.
7 3333   Lear. Pass.
7 3334   Glou. I know that voice.
7 3335   Lear. Ha! Goneril with a white beard? They flatter'd me like a
7 3336 dog,
7 3337      and told me I had white hairs in my beard ere the black ones
7 3338      were there. To say 'ay' and 'no' to everything I said! 'Ay'
7 3339 and
7 3340      'no' too was no good divinity. When the rain came to wet me
7 3341      once, and the wind to make me chatter; when the thunder
7 3342 would 
7 3343      not peace at my bidding; there I found 'em, there I smelt
7 3344 'em
7 3345      out. Go to, they are not men o' their words! They told me I
7 3346 was
7 3347      everything. 'Tis a lie- I am not ague-proof.
7 3348   Glou. The trick of that voice I do well remember.
7 3349      Is't not the King?
7 3350   Lear. Ay, every inch a king!
7 3351      When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.
7 3352      I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause?
7 3353      Adultery?
7 3354      Thou shalt not die. Die for adultery? No.
7 3355      The wren goes to't, and the small gilded fly
7 3356      Does lecher in my sight.
7 3357      Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester's bastard son
7 3358      Was kinder to his father than my daughters
7 3359      Got 'tween the lawful sheets.
7 3360      To't, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.
7 3361      Behold yond simp'ring dame,
7 3362      Whose face between her forks presageth snow,
7 3363      That minces virtue, and does shake the head
7 3364      To hear of pleasure's name. 
7 3365      The fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to't
7 3366      With a more riotous appetite.
7 3367      Down from the waist they are Centaurs,
7 3368      Though women all above.
7 3369      But to the girdle do the gods inherit,
7 3370      Beneath is all the fiend's.
7 3371      There's hell, there's darkness, there's the sulphurous pit;
7 3372      burning, scalding, stench, consumption. Fie, fie, fie! pah,
7 3373 pah!
7 3374      Give me an ounce of civet, good apothecary, to sweeten my
7 3375      imagination. There's money for thee.
7 3376   Glou. O, let me kiss that hand!
7 3377   Lear. Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.
7 3378   Glou. O ruin'd piece of nature! This great world
7 3379      Shall so wear out to naught. Dost thou know me?
7 3380   Lear. I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou squiny at
7 3381 me?
7 3382      No, do thy worst, blind Cupid! I'll not love. Read thou this
7 3383      challenge; mark but the penning of it.
7 3384   Glou. Were all the letters suns, I could not see one.
7 3385   Edg. [aside] I would not take this from report. It is,
7 3386      And my heart breaks at it. 
7 3387   Lear. Read.
7 3388   Glou. What, with the case of eyes?
7 3389   Lear. O, ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your head, nor
7 3390 no
7 3391      money in your purse? Your eyes are in a heavy case, your
7 3392 purse
7 3393      in a light. Yet you see how this world goes.
7 3394   Glou. I see it feelingly.
7 3395   Lear. What, art mad? A man may see how the world goes with no
7 3396 eyes.
7 3397      Look with thine ears. See how yond justice rails upon yond
7 3398      simple thief. Hark in thine ear. Change places and,
7 3399 handy-dandy,
7 3400      which is the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seen a
7 3401      farmer's dog bark at a beggar?
7 3402   Glou. Ay, sir.
7 3403   Lear. And the creature run from the cur? There thou mightst
7 3404 behold
7 3405      the great image of authority: a dog's obeyed in office.
7 3406      Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!
7 3407      Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back.
7 3408      Thou hotly lusts to use her in that kind
7 3409      For which thou whip'st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.
7 3410      Through tatter'd clothes small vices do appear;
7 3411      Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold, 
7 3412      And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks;
7 3413      Arm it in rags, a pygmy's straw does pierce it.
7 3414      None does offend, none- I say none! I'll able 'em.
7 3415      Take that of me, my friend, who have the power
7 3416      To seal th' accuser's lips. Get thee glass eyes
7 3417      And, like a scurvy politician, seem
7 3418      To see the things thou dost not. Now, now, now, now!
7 3419      Pull off my boots. Harder, harder! So.
7 3420   Edg. O, matter and impertinency mix'd!
7 3421      Reason, in madness!
7 3422   Lear. If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.
7 3423      I know thee well enough; thy name is Gloucester.
7 3424      Thou must be patient. We came crying hither;
7 3425      Thou know'st, the first time that we smell the air
7 3426      We wawl and cry. I will preach to thee. Mark.
7 3427   Glou. Alack, alack the day!
7 3428   Lear. When we are born, we cry that we are come
7 3429      To this great stage of fools. This' a good block.
7 3430      It were a delicate stratagem to shoe
7 3431      A troop of horse with felt. I'll put't in proof, 
7 3432      And when I have stol'n upon these sons-in-law,
7 3433      Then kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!
7 3434 
7 3435                  Enter a Gentleman [with Attendants].
7 3436 
7 3437   Gent. O, here he is! Lay hand upon him.- Sir,
7 3438      Your most dear daughter-
7 3439   Lear. No rescue? What, a prisoner? I am even
7 3440      The natural fool of fortune. Use me well;
7 3441      You shall have ransom. Let me have a surgeon;
7 3442      I am cut to th' brains.
7 3443   Gent. You shall have anything.
7 3444   Lear. No seconds? All myself?
7 3445      Why, this would make a man a man of salt,
7 3446      To use his eyes for garden waterpots,
7 3447      Ay, and laying autumn's dust.
7 3448   Gent. Good sir-
7 3449   Lear. I will die bravely, like a smug bridegroom. What!
7 3450      I will be jovial. Come, come, I am a king;
7 3451      My masters, know you that? 
7 3452   Gent. You are a royal one, and we obey you.
7 3453   Lear. Then there's life in't. Nay, an you get it, you shall get
7 3454 it
7 3455      by running. Sa, sa, sa, sa!
7 3456                               Exit running. [Attendants follow.]
7 3457   Gent. A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch,
7 3458      Past speaking of in a king! Thou hast one daughter
7 3459      Who redeems nature from the general curse
7 3460      Which twain have brought her to.
7 3461   Edg. Hail, gentle sir.
7 3462   Gent. Sir, speed you. What's your will?
7 3463   Edg. Do you hear aught, sir, of a battle toward?
7 3464   Gent. Most sure and vulgar. Every one hears that
7 3465      Which can distinguish sound.
7 3466   Edg. But, by your favour,
7 3467      How near's the other army?
7 3468   Gent. Near and on speedy foot. The main descry
7 3469      Stands on the hourly thought.
7 3470   Edg. I thank you sir. That's all.
7 3471   Gent. Though that the Queen on special cause is here,
7 3472      Her army is mov'd on. 
7 3473   Edg. I thank you, sir
7 3474                                                Exit [Gentleman].
7 3475   Glou. You ever-gentle gods, take my breath from me;
7 3476      Let not my worser spirit tempt me again
7 3477      To die before you please!
7 3478   Edg. Well pray you, father.
7 3479   Glou. Now, good sir, what are you?
7 3480   Edg. A most poor man, made tame to fortune's blows,
7 3481      Who, by the art of known and feeling sorrows,
7 3482      Am pregnant to good pity. Give me your hand;
7 3483      I'll lead you to some biding.
7 3484   Glou. Hearty thanks.
7 3485      The bounty and the benison of heaven
7 3486      To boot, and boot!
7 3487 
7 3488                      Enter [Oswald the] Steward.
7 3489 
7 3490   Osw. A proclaim'd prize! Most happy!
7 3491      That eyeless head of thine was first fram'd flesh
7 3492      To raise my fortunes. Thou old unhappy traitor, 
7 3493      Briefly thyself remember. The sword is out
7 3494      That must destroy thee.
7 3495   Glou. Now let thy friendly hand
7 3496      Put strength enough to't.
7 3497                                              [Edgar interposes.]
7 3498   Osw. Wherefore, bold peasant,
7 3499      Dar'st thou support a publish'd traitor? Hence!
7 3500      Lest that th' infection of his fortune take
7 3501      Like hold on thee. Let go his arm.
7 3502   Edg. Chill not let go, zir, without vurther 'cagion.
7 3503   Osw. Let go, slave, or thou diest!
7 3504   Edg. Good gentleman, go your gait, and let poor voke pass. An
7 3505 chud
7 3506      ha' bin zwagger'd out of my life, 'twould not ha' bin zo
7 3507 long as
7 3508      'tis by a vortnight. Nay, come not near th' old man. Keep
7 3509 out,
7 3510      che vore ye, or Ise try whether your costard or my ballow be
7 3511 the
7 3512      harder. Chill be plain with you.
7 3513   Osw. Out, dunghill!
7 3514                                                      They fight.
7 3515   Edg. Chill pick your teeth, zir. Come! No matter vor your
7 3516 foins.
7 3517                                                  [Oswald falls.] 
7 3518   Osw. Slave, thou hast slain me. Villain, take my purse.
7 3519      If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my body,
7 3520      And give the letters which thou find'st about me
7 3521      To Edmund Earl of Gloucester. Seek him out
7 3522      Upon the British party. O, untimely death! Death!
7 3523                                                         He dies.
7 3524   Edg. I know thee well. A serviceable villain,
7 3525      As duteous to the vices of thy mistress
7 3526      As badness would desire.
7 3527   Glou. What, is he dead?
7 3528   Edg. Sit you down, father; rest you.
7 3529      Let's see his pockets; these letters that he speaks of
7 3530      May be my friends. He's dead. I am only sorry
7 3531      He had no other deathsman. Let us see.
7 3532      Leave, gentle wax; and, manners, blame us not.
7 3533      To know our enemies' minds, we'ld rip their hearts;
7 3534      Their papers, is more lawful.             Reads the letter.
7 3535 
7 3536        'Let our reciprocal vows be rememb'red. You have many
7 3537      opportunities to cut him off. If your will want not, time
7 3538 and
7 3539      place will be fruitfully offer'd. There is nothing done, if
7 3540 he 
7 3541      return the conqueror. Then am I the prisoner, and his bed my
7 3542      jail; from the loathed warmth whereof deliver me, and supply
7 3543 the
7 3544      place for your labour.
7 3545            'Your (wife, so I would say) affectionate servant,
7 3546                                                          
7 3547 'Goneril.'
7 3548 
7 3549      O indistinguish'd space of woman's will!
7 3550      A plot upon her virtuous husband's life,
7 3551      And the exchange my brother! Here in the sands
7 3552      Thee I'll rake up, the post unsanctified
7 3553      Of murtherous lechers; and in the mature time
7 3554      With this ungracious paper strike the sight
7 3555      Of the death-practis'd Duke, For him 'tis well
7 3556      That of thy death and business I can tell.
7 3557   Glou. The King is mad. How stiff is my vile sense,
7 3558      That I stand up, and have ingenious feeling
7 3559      Of my huge sorrows! Better I were distract.
7 3560      So should my thoughts be sever'd from my griefs,
7 3561      And woes by wrong imaginations lose 
7 3562      The knowledge of themselves.
7 3563                                                 A drum afar off.
7 3564   Edg. Give me your hand.
7 3565      Far off methinks I hear the beaten drum.
7 3566      Come, father, I'll bestow you with a friend.        Exeunt.
7 3567

7 3570 
7 3571 Scene VII.
7 3572 A tent in the French camp.
7 3573 
7 3574 Enter Cordelia, Kent, Doctor, and Gentleman.
7 3575 
7 3576   Cor. O thou good Kent, how shall I live and work
7 3577      To match thy goodness? My life will be too short
7 3578      And every measure fail me.
7 3579   Kent. To be acknowledg'd, madam, is o'erpaid.
7 3580      All my reports go with the modest truth;
7 3581      Nor more nor clipp'd, but so.
7 3582   Cor. Be better suited.
7 3583      These weeds are memories of those worser hours.
7 3584      I prithee put them off.
7 3585   Kent. Pardon, dear madam.
7 3586      Yet to be known shortens my made intent.
7 3587      My boon I make it that you know me not
7 3588      Till time and I think meet.
7 3589   Cor. Then be't so, my good lord. [To the Doctor] How, does the
7 3590 King?
7 3591   Doct. Madam, sleeps still.
7 3592   Cor. O you kind gods,
7 3593      Cure this great breach in his abused nature! 
7 3594      Th' untun'd and jarring senses, O, wind up
7 3595      Of this child-changed father!
7 3596   Doct. So please your Majesty
7 3597      That we may wake the King? He hath slept long.
7 3598   Cor. Be govern'd by your knowledge, and proceed
7 3599      I' th' sway of your own will. Is he array'd?
7 3600 
7 3601               Enter Lear in a chair carried by Servants.
7 3602 
7 3603   Gent. Ay, madam. In the heaviness of sleep
7 3604      We put fresh garments on him.
7 3605   Doct. Be by, good madam, when we do awake him.
7 3606      I doubt not of his temperance.
7 3607   Cor. Very well.
7 3608                                                           Music.
7 3609   Doct. Please you draw near. Louder the music there!
7 3610   Cor. O my dear father, restoration hang
7 3611      Thy medicine on my lips, and let this kiss
7 3612      Repair those violent harms that my two sisters
7 3613      Have in thy reverence made! 
7 3614   Kent. Kind and dear princess!
7 3615   Cor. Had you not been their father, these white flakes
7 3616      Had challeng'd pity of them. Was this a face
7 3617      To be oppos'd against the warring winds?
7 3618      To stand against the deep dread-bolted thunder?
7 3619      In the most terrible and nimble stroke
7 3620      Of quick cross lightning? to watch- poor perdu!-
7 3621      With this thin helm? Mine enemy's dog,
7 3622      Though he had bit me, should have stood that night
7 3623      Against my fire; and wast thou fain, poor father,
7 3624      To hovel thee with swine and rogues forlorn,
7 3625      In short and musty straw? Alack, alack!
7 3626      'Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once
7 3627      Had not concluded all.- He wakes. Speak to him.
7 3628   Doct. Madam, do you; 'tis fittest.
7 3629   Cor. How does my royal lord? How fares your Majesty?
7 3630   Lear. You do me wrong to take me out o' th' grave.
7 3631      Thou art a soul in bliss; but I am bound
7 3632      Upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears
7 3633      Do scald like molten lead. 
7 3634   Cor. Sir, do you know me?
7 3635   Lear. You are a spirit, I know. When did you die?
7 3636   Cor. Still, still, far wide!
7 3637   Doct. He's scarce awake. Let him alone awhile.
7 3638   Lear. Where have I been? Where am I? Fair daylight,
7 3639      I am mightily abus'd. I should e'en die with pity,
7 3640      To see another thus. I know not what to say.
7 3641      I will not swear these are my hands. Let's see.
7 3642      I feel this pin prick. Would I were assur'd
7 3643      Of my condition!
7 3644   Cor. O, look upon me, sir,
7 3645      And hold your hands in benediction o'er me.
7 3646      No, sir, you must not kneel.
7 3647   Lear. Pray, do not mock me.
7 3648      I am a very foolish fond old man,
7 3649      Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less;
7 3650      And, to deal plainly,
7 3651      I fear I am not in my perfect mind.
7 3652      Methinks I should know you, and know this man;
7 3653      Yet I am doubtful; for I am mainly ignorant 
7 3654      What place this is; and all the skill I have
7 3655      Remembers not these garments; nor I know not
7 3656      Where I did lodge last night. Do not laugh at me;
7 3657      For (as I am a man) I think this lady
7 3658      To be my child Cordelia.
7 3659   Cor. And so I am! I am!
7 3660   Lear. Be your tears wet? Yes, faith. I pray weep not.
7 3661      If you have poison for me, I will drink it.
7 3662      I know you do not love me; for your sisters
7 3663      Have, as I do remember, done me wrong.
7 3664      You have some cause, they have not.
7 3665   Cor. No cause, no cause.
7 3666   Lear. Am I in France?
7 3667   Kent. In your own kingdom, sir.
7 3668   Lear. Do not abuse me.
7 3669   Doct. Be comforted, good madam. The great rage
7 3670      You see is kill'd in him; and yet it is danger
7 3671      To make him even o'er the time he has lost.
7 3672      Desire him to go in. Trouble him no more
7 3673      Till further settling. 
7 3674   Cor. Will't please your Highness walk?
7 3675   Lear. You must bear with me.
7 3676      Pray you now, forget and forgive. I am old and foolish.
7 3677                               Exeunt. Manent Kent and Gentleman.
7 3678   Gent. Holds it true, sir, that the Duke of Cornwall was so
7 3679 slain?
7 3680   Kent. Most certain, sir.
7 3681   Gent. Who is conductor of his people?
7 3682   Kent. As 'tis said, the bastard son of Gloucester.
7 3683   Gent. They say Edgar, his banish'd son, is with the Earl of
7 3684 Kent
7 3685      in Germany.
7 3686   Kent. Report is changeable. 'Tis time to look about; the powers
7 3687 of
7 3688      the kingdom approach apace.
7 3689   Gent. The arbitrement is like to be bloody.
7 3690      Fare you well, sir.                                 [Exit.]
7 3691   Kent. My point and period will be throughly wrought,
7 3692      Or well or ill, as this day's battle's fought.        Exit.

7 3708 ACT V. Scene I.
7 3709 The British camp near Dover.
7 3710 
7 3711 Enter, with Drum and Colours, Edmund, Regan, Gentleman, and
7 3712 Soldiers.
7 3713 
7 3714   Edm. Know of the Duke if his last purpose hold,
7 3715      Or whether since he is advis'd by aught
7 3716      To change the course. He's full of alteration
7 3717      And self-reproving. Bring his constant pleasure.
7 3718                                               [Exit an Officer.]
7 3719   Reg. Our sister's man is certainly miscarried.
7 3720   Edm. Tis to be doubted, madam.
7 3721   Reg. Now, sweet lord,
7 3722      You know the goodness I intend upon you.
7 3723      Tell me- but truly- but then speak the truth-
7 3724      Do you not love my sister?
7 3725   Edm. In honour'd love.
7 3726   Reg. But have you never found my brother's way
7 3727      To the forfended place?
7 3728   Edm. That thought abuses you.
7 3729   Reg. I am doubtful that you have been conjunct 
7 3730      And bosom'd with her, as far as we call hers.
7 3731   Edm. No, by mine honour, madam.
7 3732   Reg. I never shall endure her. Dear my lord,
7 3733      Be not familiar with her.
7 3734   Edm. Fear me not.
7 3735      She and the Duke her husband!
7 3736 
7 3737        Enter, with Drum and Colours, Albany, Goneril, Soldiers.
7 3738 
7 3739   Gon. [aside] I had rather lose the battle than that sister
7 3740      Should loosen him and me.
7 3741   Alb. Our very loving sister, well bemet.
7 3742      Sir, this I hear: the King is come to his daughter,
7 3743      With others whom the rigour of our state
7 3744      Forc'd to cry out. Where I could not be honest,
7 3745      I never yet was valiant. For this business,
7 3746      It toucheth us as France invades our land,
7 3747      Not bolds the King, with others whom, I fear,
7 3748      Most just and heavy causes make oppose.
7 3749   Edm. Sir, you speak nobly. 
7 3750   Reg. Why is this reason'd?
7 3751   Gon. Combine together 'gainst the enemy;
7 3752      For these domestic and particular broils
7 3753      Are not the question here.
7 3754   Alb. Let's then determine
7 3755      With th' ancient of war on our proceeding.
7 3756   Edm. I shall attend you presently at your tent.
7 3757   Reg. Sister, you'll go with us?
7 3758   Gon. No.
7 3759   Reg. 'Tis most convenient. Pray you go with us.
7 3760   Gon. [aside] O, ho, I know the riddle.- I will go.
7 3761 
7 3762           [As they are going out,] enter Edgar [disguised].
7 3763 
7 3764   Edg. If e'er your Grace had speech with man so poor,
7 3765      Hear me one word.
7 3766   Alb. I'll overtake you.- Speak.
7 3767                               Exeunt [all but Albany and Edgar].
7 3768   Edg. Before you fight the battle, ope this letter.
7 3769      If you have victory, let the trumpet sound 
7 3770      For him that brought it. Wretched though I seem,
7 3771      I can produce a champion that will prove
7 3772      What is avouched there. If you miscarry,
7 3773      Your business of the world hath so an end,
7 3774      And machination ceases. Fortune love you!
7 3775   Alb. Stay till I have read the letter.
7 3776   Edg. I was forbid it.
7 3777      When time shall serve, let but the herald cry,
7 3778      And I'll appear again.
7 3779   Alb. Why, fare thee well. I will o'erlook thy paper.
7 3780                                                    Exit [Edgar].
7 3781 
7 3782                             Enter Edmund.
7 3783 
7 3784   Edm. The enemy 's in view; draw up your powers.
7 3785      Here is the guess of their true strength and forces
7 3786      By diligent discovery; but your haste
7 3787      Is now urg'd on you.
7 3788   Alb. We will greet the time.                             Exit.
7 3789   Edm. To both these sisters have I sworn my love; 
7 3790      Each jealous of the other, as the stung
7 3791      Are of the adder. Which of them shall I take?
7 3792      Both? one? or neither? Neither can be enjoy'd,
7 3793      If both remain alive. To take the widow
7 3794      Exasperates, makes mad her sister Goneril;
7 3795      And hardly shall I carry out my side,
7 3796      Her husband being alive. Now then, we'll use
7 3797      His countenance for the battle, which being done,
7 3798      Let her who would be rid of him devise
7 3799      His speedy taking off. As for the mercy
7 3800      Which he intends to Lear and to Cordelia-
7 3801      The battle done, and they within our power,
7 3802      Shall never see his pardon; for my state
7 3803      Stands on me to defend, not to debate.                Exit.

7 3808 Scene II.
7 3809 A field between the two camps.
7 3810 
7 3811 Alarum within. Enter, with Drum and Colours, the Powers of France
7 3812 over the stage, Cordelia with her Father in her hand, and exeunt.
7 3813 
7 3814 Enter Edgar and Gloucester.
7 3815 
7 3816   Edg. Here, father, take the shadow of this tree
7 3817      For your good host. Pray that the right may thrive.
7 3818      If ever I return to you again,
7 3819      I'll bring you comfort.
7 3820   Glou. Grace go with you, sir!
7 3821                                                    Exit [Edgar].
7 3822 
7 3823                Alarum and retreat within. Enter Edgar,
7 3824 
7 3825   Edg. Away, old man! give me thy hand! away!
7 3826      King Lear hath lost, he and his daughter ta'en.
7 3827      Give me thy hand! come on!
7 3828   Glou. No further, sir. A man may rot even here. 
7 3829   Edg. What, in ill thoughts again? Men must endure
7 3830      Their going hence, even as their coming hither;
7 3831      Ripeness is all. Come on.
7 3832   Glou. And that's true too.                             Exeunt.
7 3833

7 3837 Scene III.
7 3838 The British camp, near Dover.
7 3839 
7 3840 Enter, in conquest, with Drum and Colours, Edmund; Lear and
7 3841 Cordelia
7 3842 as prisoners; Soldiers, Captain.
7 3843 
7 3844   Edm. Some officers take them away. Good guard
7 3845      Until their greater pleasures first be known
7 3846      That are to censure them.
7 3847   Cor. We are not the first
7 3848      Who with best meaning have incurr'd the worst.
7 3849      For thee, oppressed king, am I cast down;
7 3850      Myself could else outfrown false Fortune's frown.
7 3851      Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters?
7 3852   Lear. No, no, no, no! Come, let's away to prison.
7 3853      We two alone will sing like birds i' th' cage.
7 3854      When thou dost ask me blessing, I'll kneel down
7 3855      And ask of thee forgiveness. So we'll live,
7 3856      And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh
7 3857      At gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues
7 3858      Talk of court news; and we'll talk with them too-
7 3859      Who loses and who wins; who's in, who's out- 
7 3860      And take upon 's the mystery of things,
7 3861      As if we were God's spies; and we'll wear out,
7 3862      In a wall'd prison, packs and sects of great ones
7 3863      That ebb and flow by th' moon.
7 3864   Edm. Take them away.
7 3865   Lear. Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,
7 3866      The gods themselves throw incense. Have I caught thee?
7 3867      He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven
7 3868      And fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes.
7 3869      The goodyears shall devour 'em, flesh and fell,
7 3870      Ere they shall make us weep! We'll see 'em starv'd first.
7 3871      Come.                  Exeunt [Lear and Cordelia, guarded].
7 3872   Edm. Come hither, Captain; hark.
7 3873      Take thou this note [gives a paper]. Go follow them to
7 3874 prison.
7 3875      One step I have advanc'd thee. If thou dost
7 3876      As this instructs thee, thou dost make thy way
7 3877      To noble fortunes. Know thou this, that men
7 3878      Are as the time is. To be tender-minded
7 3879      Does not become a sword. Thy great employment
7 3880      Will not bear question. Either say thou'lt do't, 
7 3881      Or thrive by other means.
7 3882   Capt. I'll do't, my lord.
7 3883   Edm. About it! and write happy when th' hast done.
7 3884      Mark- I say, instantly; and carry it so
7 3885      As I have set it down.
7 3886   Capt. I cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats;
7 3887      If it be man's work, I'll do't.                       Exit.
7 3888 
7 3889           Flourish. Enter Albany, Goneril, Regan, Soldiers.
7 3890 
7 3891   Alb. Sir, you have show'd to-day your valiant strain,
7 3892      And fortune led you well. You have the captives
7 3893      Who were the opposites of this day's strife.
7 3894      We do require them of you, so to use them
7 3895      As we shall find their merits and our safety
7 3896      May equally determine.
7 3897   Edm. Sir, I thought it fit
7 3898      To send the old and miserable King
7 3899      To some retention and appointed guard;
7 3900      Whose age has charms in it, whose title more, 
7 3901      To pluck the common bosom on his side
7 3902      And turn our impress'd lances in our eyes
7 3903      Which do command them. With him I sent the Queen,
7 3904      My reason all the same; and they are ready
7 3905      To-morrow, or at further space, t' appear
7 3906      Where you shall hold your session. At this time
7 3907      We sweat and bleed: the friend hath lost his friend;
7 3908      And the best quarrels, in the heat, are curs'd
7 3909      By those that feel their sharpness.
7 3910      The question of Cordelia and her father
7 3911      Requires a fitter place.
7 3912   Alb. Sir, by your patience,
7 3913      I hold you but a subject of this war,
7 3914      Not as a brother.
7 3915   Reg. That's as we list to grace him.
7 3916      Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded
7 3917      Ere you had spoke so far. He led our powers,
7 3918      Bore the commission of my place and person,
7 3919      The which immediacy may well stand up
7 3920      And call itself your brother. 
7 3921   Gon. Not so hot!
7 3922      In his own grace he doth exalt himself
7 3923      More than in your addition.
7 3924   Reg. In my rights
7 3925      By me invested, he compeers the best.
7 3926   Gon. That were the most if he should husband you.
7 3927   Reg. Jesters do oft prove prophets.
7 3928   Gon. Holla, holla!
7 3929      That eye that told you so look'd but asquint.
7 3930   Reg. Lady, I am not well; else I should answer
7 3931      From a full-flowing stomach. General,
7 3932      Take thou my soldiers, prisoners, patrimony;
7 3933      Dispose of them, of me; the walls are thine.
7 3934      Witness the world that I create thee here
7 3935      My lord and master.
7 3936   Gon. Mean you to enjoy him?
7 3937   Alb. The let-alone lies not in your good will.
7 3938   Edm. Nor in thine, lord.
7 3939   Alb. Half-blooded fellow, yes.
7 3940   Reg. [to Edmund] Let the drum strike, and prove my title thine.
7 3941 
7 3942   Alb. Stay yet; hear reason. Edmund, I arrest thee
7 3943      On capital treason; and, in thine attaint,
7 3944      This gilded serpent [points to Goneril]. For your claim,
7 3945 fair
7 3946         sister,
7 3947      I bar it in the interest of my wife.
7 3948      'Tis she is subcontracted to this lord,
7 3949      And I, her husband, contradict your banes.
7 3950      If you will marry, make your loves to me;
7 3951      My lady is bespoke.
7 3952   Gon. An interlude!
7 3953   Alb. Thou art arm'd, Gloucester. Let the trumpet sound.
7 3954      If none appear to prove upon thy person
7 3955      Thy heinous, manifest, and many treasons,
7 3956      There is my pledge [throws down a glove]! I'll prove it on
7 3957 thy
7 3958         heart,
7 3959      Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
7 3960      Than I have here proclaim'd thee.
7 3961   Reg. Sick, O, sick!
7 3962   Gon. [aside] If not, I'll ne'er trust medicine.
7 3963   Edm. There's my exchange [throws down a glove]. What in the
7 3964 world 
7 3965         he is
7 3966      That names me traitor, villain-like he lies.
7 3967      Call by thy trumpet. He that dares approach,
7 3968      On him, on you, who not? I will maintain
7 3969      My truth and honour firmly.
7 3970   Alb. A herald, ho!
7 3971   Edm. A herald, ho, a herald!
7 3972   Alb. Trust to thy single virtue; for thy soldiers,
7 3973      All levied in my name, have in my name
7 3974      Took their discharge.
7 3975   Reg. My sickness grows upon me.
7 3976   Alb. She is not well. Convey her to my tent.
7 3977                                               [Exit Regan, led.]
7 3978 
7 3979                            Enter a Herald.
7 3980 
7 3981      Come hither, herald. Let the trumpet sound,
7 3982      And read out this.
7 3983   Capt. Sound, trumpet!                        A trumpet sounds.
7 3984  
7 3985   Her. (reads) 'If any man of quality or degree within the lists
7 3986 of
7 3987      the army will maintain upon Edmund, supposed Earl of
7 3988 Gloucester,
7 3989      that he is a manifold traitor, let him appear by the third
7 3990 sound
7 3991      of the trumpet. He is bold in his defence.'
7 3992 
7 3993   Edm. Sound!                                     First trumpet.
7 3994   Her. Again!                                    Second trumpet.
7 3995   Her. Again!                                     Third trumpet.
7 3996                                          Trumpet answers within.
7 3997 
7 3998     Enter Edgar, armed, at the third sound, a Trumpet before him.
7 3999 
7 4000   Alb. Ask him his purposes, why he appears
7 4001      Upon this call o' th' trumpet.
7 4002   Her. What are you?
7 4003      Your name, your quality? and why you answer
7 4004      This present summons?
7 4005   Edg. Know my name is lost;
7 4006      By treason's tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit.
7 4007      Yet am I noble as the adversary 
7 4008      I come to cope.
7 4009   Alb. Which is that adversary?
7 4010   Edg. What's he that speaks for Edmund Earl of Gloucester?
7 4011   Edm. Himself. What say'st thou to him?
7 4012   Edg. Draw thy sword,
7 4013      That, if my speech offend a noble heart,
7 4014      Thy arm may do thee justice. Here is mine.
7 4015      Behold, it is the privilege of mine honours,
7 4016      My oath, and my profession. I protest-
7 4017      Maugre thy strength, youth, place, and eminence,
7 4018      Despite thy victor sword and fire-new fortune,
7 4019      Thy valour and thy heart- thou art a traitor;
7 4020      False to thy gods, thy brother, and thy father;
7 4021      Conspirant 'gainst this high illustrious prince;
7 4022      And from th' extremest upward of thy head
7 4023      To the descent and dust beneath thy foot,
7 4024      A most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou 'no,'
7 4025      This sword, this arm, and my best spirits are bent
7 4026      To prove upon thy heart, whereto I speak,
7 4027      Thou liest. 
7 4028   Edm. In wisdom I should ask thy name;
7 4029      But since thy outside looks so fair and warlike,
7 4030      And that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes,
7 4031      What safe and nicely I might well delay
7 4032      By rule of knighthood, I disdain and spurn.
7 4033      Back do I toss those treasons to thy head;
7 4034      With the hell-hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart;
7 4035      Which- for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise-
7 4036      This sword of mine shall give them instant way
7 4037      Where they shall rest for ever. Trumpets, speak!
7 4038                                  Alarums. Fight. [Edmund falls.]
7 4039   Alb. Save him, save him!
7 4040   Gon. This is mere practice, Gloucester.
7 4041      By th' law of arms thou wast not bound to answer
7 4042      An unknown opposite. Thou art not vanquish'd,
7 4043      But cozen'd and beguil'd.
7 4044   Alb. Shut your mouth, dame,
7 4045      Or with this paper shall I stop it. [Shows her her letter to
7 4046      Edmund.]- [To Edmund]. Hold, sir.
7 4047      [To Goneril] Thou worse than any name, read thine own evil. 
7 4048      No tearing, lady! I perceive you know it.
7 4049   Gon. Say if I do- the laws are mine, not thine.
7 4050      Who can arraign me for't?
7 4051   Alb. Most monstrous!
7 4052      Know'st thou this paper?
7 4053   Gon. Ask me not what I know.                             Exit.
7 4054   Alb. Go after her. She's desperate; govern her.
7 4055                                               [Exit an Officer.]
7 4056   Edm. What, you have charg'd me with, that have I done,
7 4057      And more, much more. The time will bring it out.
7 4058      'Tis past, and so am I.- But what art thou
7 4059      That hast this fortune on me? If thou'rt noble,
7 4060      I do forgive thee.
7 4061   Edg. Let's exchange charity.
7 4062      I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund;
7 4063      If more, the more th' hast wrong'd me.
7 4064      My name is Edgar and thy father's son.
7 4065      The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices
7 4066      Make instruments to scourge us.
7 4067      The dark and vicious place where thee he got 
7 4068      Cost him his eyes.
7 4069   Edm. Th' hast spoken right; 'tis true.
7 4070      The wheel is come full circle; I am here.
7 4071   Alb. Methought thy very gait did prophesy
7 4072      A royal nobleness. I must embrace thee.
7 4073      Let sorrow split my heart if ever I
7 4074      Did hate thee, or thy father!
7 4075   Edg. Worthy prince, I know't.
7 4076   Alb. Where have you hid yourself?
7 4077      How have you known the miseries of your father?
7 4078   Edg. By nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale;
7 4079      And when 'tis told, O that my heart would burst!
7 4080      The bloody proclamation to escape
7 4081      That follow'd me so near (O, our lives' sweetness!
7 4082      That with the pain of death would hourly die
7 4083      Rather than die at once!) taught me to shift
7 4084      Into a madman's rags, t' assume a semblance
7 4085      That very dogs disdain'd; and in this habit
7 4086      Met I my father with his bleeding rings,
7 4087      Their precious stones new lost; became his guide, 
7 4088      Led him, begg'd for him, sav'd him from despair;
7 4089      Never (O fault!) reveal'd myself unto him
7 4090      Until some half hour past, when I was arm'd,
7 4091      Not sure, though hoping of this good success,
7 4092      I ask'd his blessing, and from first to last
7 4093      Told him my pilgrimage. But his flaw'd heart
7 4094      (Alack, too weak the conflict to support!)
7 4095      'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,
7 4096      Burst smilingly.
7 4097   Edm. This speech of yours hath mov'd me,
7 4098      And shall perchance do good; but speak you on;
7 4099      You look as you had something more to say.
7 4100   Alb. If there be more, more woful, hold it in;
7 4101      For I am almost ready to dissolve,
7 4102      Hearing of this.
7 4103   Edg. This would have seem'd a period
7 4104      To such as love not sorrow; but another,
7 4105      To amplify too much, would make much more,
7 4106      And top extremity.
7 4107      Whilst I was big in clamour, came there a man, 
7 4108      Who, having seen me in my worst estate,
7 4109      Shunn'd my abhorr'd society; but then, finding
7 4110      Who 'twas that so endur'd, with his strong arms
7 4111      He fastened on my neck, and bellowed out
7 4112      As he'd burst heaven; threw him on my father;
7 4113      Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him
7 4114      That ever ear receiv'd; which in recounting
7 4115      His grief grew puissant, and the strings of life
7 4116      Began to crack. Twice then the trumpets sounded,
7 4117      And there I left him tranc'd.
7 4118   Alb. But who was this?
7 4119   Edg. Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent; who in disguise
7 4120      Followed his enemy king and did him service
7 4121      Improper for a slave.
7 4122 
7 4123                 Enter a Gentleman with a bloody knife.
7 4124 
7 4125   Gent. Help, help! O, help!
7 4126   Edg. What kind of help?
7 4127   Alb. Speak, man. 
7 4128   Edg. What means that bloody knife?
7 4129   Gent. 'Tis hot, it smokes.
7 4130      It came even from the heart of- O! she's dead!
7 4131   Alb. Who dead? Speak, man.
7 4132   Gent. Your lady, sir, your lady! and her sister
7 4133      By her is poisoned; she hath confess'd it.
7 4134   Edm. I was contracted to them both. All three
7 4135      Now marry in an instant.
7 4136 
7 4137                              Enter Kent.
7 4138 
7 4139   Edg. Here comes Kent.
7 4140   Alb. Produce their bodies, be they alive or dead.
7 4141                                                [Exit Gentleman.]
7 4142      This judgement of the heavens, that makes us tremble
7 4143      Touches us not with pity. O, is this he?
7 4144      The time will not allow the compliment
7 4145      That very manners urges.
7 4146   Kent. I am come
7 4147      To bid my king and master aye good night. 
7 4148      Is he not here?
7 4149   Alb. Great thing of us forgot!
7 4150      Speak, Edmund, where's the King? and where's Cordelia?
7 4151                  The bodies of Goneril and Regan are brought in.
7 4152      Seest thou this object, Kent?
7 4153   Kent. Alack, why thus?
7 4154   Edm. Yet Edmund was belov'd.
7 4155      The one the other poisoned for my sake,
7 4156      And after slew herself.
7 4157   Alb. Even so. Cover their faces.
7 4158   Edm. I pant for life. Some good I mean to do,
7 4159      Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send
7 4160      (Be brief in't) to the castle; for my writ
7 4161      Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia.
7 4162      Nay, send in time.
7 4163   Alb. Run, run, O, run!
7 4164   Edg. To who, my lord? Who has the office? Send
7 4165      Thy token of reprieve.
7 4166   Edm. Well thought on. Take my sword;
7 4167      Give it the Captain. 
7 4168   Alb. Haste thee for thy life.                    [Exit Edgar.]
7 4169   Edm. He hath commission from thy wife and me
7 4170      To hang Cordelia in the prison and
7 4171      To lay the blame upon her own despair
7 4172      That she fordid herself.
7 4173   Alb. The gods defend her! Bear him hence awhile.
7 4174                                           [Edmund is borne off.]
7 4175 
7 4176     Enter Lear, with Cordelia [dead] in his arms, [Edgar,
7 4177 Captain,
7 4178                         and others following].
7 4179 
7 4180   Lear. Howl, howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stone.
7 4181      Had I your tongues and eyes, I'ld use them so
7 4182      That heaven's vault should crack. She's gone for ever!
7 4183      I know when one is dead, and when one lives.
7 4184      She's dead as earth. Lend me a looking glass.
7 4185      If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,
7 4186      Why, then she lives.
7 4187   Kent. Is this the promis'd end?
7 4188   Edg. Or image of that horror? 
7 4189   Alb. Fall and cease!
7 4190   Lear. This feather stirs; she lives! If it be so,
7 4191      It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows
7 4192      That ever I have felt.
7 4193   Kent. O my good master!
7 4194   Lear. Prithee away!
7 4195   Edg. 'Tis noble Kent, your friend.
7 4196   Lear. A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!
7 4197      I might have sav'd her; now she's gone for ever!
7 4198      Cordelia, Cordelia! stay a little. Ha!
7 4199      What is't thou say'st, Her voice was ever soft,
7 4200      Gentle, and low- an excellent thing in woman.
7 4201      I kill'd the slave that was a-hanging thee.
7 4202   Capt. 'Tis true, my lords, he did.
7 4203   Lear. Did I not, fellow?
7 4204      I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion
7 4205      I would have made them skip. I am old now,
7 4206      And these same crosses spoil me. Who are you?
7 4207      Mine eyes are not o' th' best. I'll tell you straight.
7 4208   Kent. If fortune brag of two she lov'd and hated, 
7 4209      One of them we behold.
7 4210   Lear. This' a dull sight. Are you not Kent?
7 4211   Kent. The same-
7 4212      Your servant Kent. Where is your servant Caius?
7 4213   Lear. He's a good fellow, I can tell you that.
7 4214      He'll strike, and quickly too. He's dead and rotten.
7 4215   Kent. No, my good lord; I am the very man-
7 4216   Lear. I'll see that straight.
7 4217   Kent. That from your first of difference and decay
7 4218      Have followed your sad steps.
7 4219   Lear. You're welcome hither.
7 4220   Kent. Nor no man else! All's cheerless, dark, and deadly.
7 4221      Your eldest daughters have fordone themselves,
7 4222      And desperately are dead.
7 4223   Lear. Ay, so I think.
7 4224   Alb. He knows not what he says; and vain is it
7 4225      That we present us to him.
7 4226   Edg. Very bootless.
7 4227 
7 4228                            Enter a Captain. 
7 4229 
7 4230   Capt. Edmund is dead, my lord.
7 4231   Alb. That's but a trifle here.
7 4232      You lords and noble friends, know our intent.
7 4233      What comfort to this great decay may come
7 4234      Shall be applied. For us, we will resign,
7 4235      During the life of this old Majesty,
7 4236      To him our absolute power; [to Edgar and Kent] you to your
7 4237         rights;
7 4238      With boot, and Such addition as your honours
7 4239      Have more than merited.- All friends shall taste
7 4240      The wages of their virtue, and all foes
7 4241      The cup of their deservings.- O, see, see!
7 4242   Lear. And my poor fool is hang'd! No, no, no life!
7 4243      Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life,
7 4244      And thou no breath at all? Thou'lt come no more,
7 4245      Never, never, never, never, never!
7 4246      Pray you undo this button. Thank you, sir.
7 4247      Do you see this? Look on her! look! her lips!
7 4248      Look there, look there!                            He dies. 
7 4249   Edg. He faints! My lord, my lord!
7 4250   Kent. Break, heart; I prithee break!
7 4251   Edg. Look up, my lord.
7 4252   Kent. Vex not his ghost. O, let him pass! He hates him
7 4253      That would upon the rack of this tough world
7 4254      Stretch him out longer.
7 4255   Edg. He is gone indeed.
7 4256   Kent. The wonder is, he hath endur'd so long.
7 4257      He but usurp'd his life.
7 4258   Alb. Bear them from hence. Our present business
7 4259      Is general woe. [To Kent and Edgar] Friends of my soul, you
7 4260         twain
7 4261      Rule in this realm, and the gor'd state sustain.
7 4262   Kent. I have a journey, sir, shortly to go.
7 4263      My master calls me; I must not say no.
7 4264   Alb. The weight of this sad time we must obey,
7 4265      Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.
7 4266      The oldest have borne most; we that are young
7 4267      Shall never see so much, nor live so long.
7 4268                                        Exeunt with a dead march.
7 4269
