10 79 
10 80 Enter RICHARD, DUKE OF GLOUCESTER, solus
10 81 
10 82   GLOUCESTER. Now is the winter of our discontent
10 83     Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
10 84     And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
10 85     In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
10 86     Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
10 87     Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
10 88     Our stern alarums chang'd to merry meetings,
10 89     Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
10 90     Grim-visag'd war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front,
10 91     And now, instead of mounting barbed steeds
10 92     To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
10 93     He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
10 94     To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
10 95     But I-that am not shap'd for sportive tricks,
10 96     Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass-
10 97     I-that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
10 98     To strut before a wanton ambling nymph-
10 99     I-that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,
10 100     Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
10 101     Deform'd, unfinish'd, sent before my time
10 102     Into this breathing world scarce half made up,
10 103     And that so lamely and unfashionable
10 104     That dogs bark at me as I halt by them-
10 105     Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,
10 106     Have no delight to pass away the time,
10 107     Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
10 108     And descant on mine own deformity.
10 109     And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover
10 110     To entertain these fair well-spoken days,
10 111     I am determined to prove a villain
10 112     And hate the idle pleasures of these days.
10 113     Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,
10 114     By drunken prophecies, libels, and dreams,
10 115     To set my brother Clarence and the King
10 116     In deadly hate the one against the other;
10 117     And if King Edward be as true and just
10 118     As I am subtle, false, and treacherous,
10 119     This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up-
10 120     About a prophecy which says that G
10 121     Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.
10 122     Dive, thoughts, down to my soul. Here Clarence comes.
10 123 
10 124              Enter CLARENCE, guarded, and BRAKENBURY
10 125 
10 126     Brother, good day. What means this armed guard
10 127     That waits upon your Grace?
10 128   CLARENCE. His Majesty,
10 129     Tend'ring my person's safety, hath appointed
10 130     This conduct to convey me to th' Tower.
10 131   GLOUCESTER. Upon what cause?
10 132   CLARENCE. Because my name is George.
10 133   GLOUCESTER. Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours:
10 134     He should, for that, commit your godfathers.
10 135     O, belike his Majesty hath some intent
10 136     That you should be new-christ'ned in the Tower.
10 137     But what's the matter, Clarence? May I know?
10 138   CLARENCE. Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest
10 139     As yet I do not; but, as I can learn,
10 140     He hearkens after prophecies and dreams,
10 141     And from the cross-row plucks the letter G,
10 142     And says a wizard told him that by G
10 143     His issue disinherited should be;
10 144     And, for my name of George begins with G,
10 145     It follows in his thought that I am he.
10 146     These, as I learn, and such like toys as these
10 147     Hath mov'd his Highness to commit me now.
10 148   GLOUCESTER. Why, this it is when men are rul'd by women:
10 149     'Tis not the King that sends you to the Tower;
10 150     My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she
10 151     That tempers him to this extremity.
10 152     Was it not she and that good man of worship,
10 153     Antony Woodville, her brother there,
10 154     That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,
10 155     From whence this present day he is delivered?
10 156     We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.
10 157   CLARENCE. By heaven, I think there is no man is secure
10 158     But the Queen's kindred, and night-walking heralds
10 159     That trudge betwixt the King and Mistress Shore.
10 160     Heard you not what an humble suppliant
10 161     Lord Hastings was, for her delivery?
10 162   GLOUCESTER. Humbly complaining to her deity
10 163     Got my Lord Chamberlain his liberty.
10 164     I'll tell you what-I think it is our way,
10 165     If we will keep in favour with the King,
10 166     To be her men and wear her livery:
10 167     The jealous o'er-worn widow, and herself,
10 168     Since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen,
10 169     Are mighty gossips in our monarchy.
10 170   BRAKENBURY. I beseech your Graces both to pardon me:
10 171     His Majesty hath straitly given in charge
10 172     That no man shall have private conference,
10 173     Of what degree soever, with your brother.
10 174   GLOUCESTER. Even so; an't please your worship, Brakenbury,
10 175     You may partake of any thing we say:
10 176     We speak no treason, man; we say the King
10 177     Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen
10 178     Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous;
10 179     We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,
10 180     A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;
10 181     And that the Queen's kindred are made gentlefolks.
10 182     How say you, sir? Can you deny all this?
10 183   BRAKENBURY. With this, my lord, myself have naught to do.
10 184   GLOUCESTER. Naught to do with Mistress Shore! I tell thee,
10 185     fellow,
10 186     He that doth naught with her, excepting one,
10 187     Were best to do it secretly alone.
10 188   BRAKENBURY. What one, my lord?
10 189   GLOUCESTER. Her husband, knave! Wouldst thou betray me?
10 190   BRAKENBURY. I do beseech your Grace to pardon me, and
10 191     withal
10 192     Forbear your conference with the noble Duke.
10 193   CLARENCE. We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will
10 194     obey.
10 195   GLOUCESTER. We are the Queen's abjects and must obey.
10 196     Brother, farewell; I will unto the King;
10 197     And whatsoe'er you will employ me in-
10 198     Were it to call King Edward's widow sister-
10 199     I will perform it to enfranchise you.
10 200     Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood
10 201     Touches me deeper than you can imagine.
10 202   CLARENCE. I know it pleaseth neither of us well.
10 203   GLOUCESTER. Well, your imprisonment shall not be long;
10 204     I will deliver or else lie for you.
10 205     Meantime, have patience.
10 206   CLARENCE. I must perforce. Farewell.
10 207                           Exeunt CLARENCE, BRAKENBURY, and guard
10 208   GLOUCESTER. Go tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.
10 209     Simple, plain Clarence, I do love thee so
10 210     That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,
10 211     If heaven will take the present at our hands.
10 212     But who comes here? The new-delivered Hastings?
10 213 
10 214                        Enter LORD HASTINGS
10 215 
10 216   HASTINGS. Good time of day unto my gracious lord!
10 217   GLOUCESTER. As much unto my good Lord Chamberlain!
10 218     Well are you welcome to the open air.
10 219     How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment?
10 220   HASTINGS. With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must;
10 221     But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks
10 222     That were the cause of my imprisonment.
10 223   GLOUCESTER. No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;
10 224     For they that were your enemies are his,
10 225     And have prevail'd as much on him as you.
10 226   HASTINGS. More pity that the eagles should be mew'd
10 227     Whiles kites and buzzards prey at liberty.
10 228   GLOUCESTER. What news abroad?
10 229   HASTINGS. No news so bad abroad as this at home:
10 230     The King is sickly, weak, and melancholy,
10 231     And his physicians fear him mightily.
10 232   GLOUCESTER. Now, by Saint John, that news is bad indeed.
10 233     O, he hath kept an evil diet long
10 234     And overmuch consum'd his royal person!
10 235     'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.
10 236     Where is he? In his bed?
10 237   HASTINGS. He is.
10 238   GLOUCESTER. Go you before, and I will follow you.
10 239                                                    Exit HASTINGS
10 240     He cannot live, I hope, and must not die
10 241     Till George be pack'd with posthorse up to heaven.
10 242     I'll in to urge his hatred more to Clarence
10 243     With lies well steel'd with weighty arguments;
10 244     And, if I fail not in my deep intent,
10 245     Clarence hath not another day to live;
10 246     Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,
10 247     And leave the world for me to bustle in!
10 248     For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter.
10 249     What though I kill'd her husband and her father?
10 250     The readiest way to make the wench amends
10 251     Is to become her husband and her father;
10 252     The which will I-not all so much for love
10 253     As for another secret close intent
10 254     By marrying her which I must reach unto.
10 255     But yet I run before my horse to market.
10 256     Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns;
10 257     When they are gone, then must I count my gains.         Exit
10 258 
10 259 
10 260 
10 261 
10 262 SCENE 2.
10 263 
10 264 London. Another street
10 265 
10 266 Enter corpse of KING HENRY THE SIXTH, with halberds to guard it;
10 267 LADY ANNE being the mourner, attended by TRESSEL and BERKELEY
10 268 
10 269   ANNE. Set down, set down your honourable load-
10 270     If honour may be shrouded in a hearse;
10 271     Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament
10 272     Th' untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.
10 273     Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!
10 274     Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster!
10 275     Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!
10 276     Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost
10 277     To hear the lamentations of poor Anne,
10 278     Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughtered son,
10 279     Stabb'd by the self-same hand that made these wounds.
10 280     Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life
10 281     I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.
10 282     O, cursed be the hand that made these holes!
10 283     Cursed the heart that had the heart to do it!
10 284     Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!
10 285     More direful hap betide that hated wretch
10 286     That makes us wretched by the death of thee
10 287     Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,
10 288     Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives!
10 289     If ever he have child, abortive be it,
10 290     Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,
10 291     Whose ugly and unnatural aspect
10 292     May fright the hopeful mother at the view,
10 293     And that be heir to his unhappiness!
10 294     If ever he have wife, let her be made
10 295     More miserable by the death of him
10 296     Than I am made by my young lord and thee!
10 297     Come, now towards Chertsey with your holy load,
10 298     Taken from Paul's to be interred there;
10 299     And still as you are weary of this weight
10 300     Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry's corse.
10 301                                 [The bearers take up the coffin]
10 302 
10 303                       Enter GLOUCESTER
10 304 
10 305   GLOUCESTER. Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.
10 306   ANNE. What black magician conjures up this fiend
10 307     To stop devoted charitable deeds?
10 308   GLOUCESTER. Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
10 309     I'll make a corse of him that disobeys!
10 310   FIRST GENTLEMAN. My lord, stand back, and let the coffin
10 311     pass.
10 312   GLOUCESTER. Unmannerd dog! Stand thou, when I command.
10 313     Advance thy halberd higher than my breast,
10 314     Or, by Saint Paul, I'll strike thee to my foot
10 315     And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.
10 316                                [The bearers set down the coffin]
10 317   ANNE. What, do you tremble? Are you all afraid?
10 318     Alas, I blame you not, for you are mortal,
10 319     And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.
10 320     Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell!
10 321     Thou hadst but power over his mortal body,
10 322     His soul thou canst not have; therefore, be gone.
10 323   GLOUCESTER. Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.
10 324   ANNE. Foul devil, for God's sake, hence and trouble us not;
10 325     For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell
10 326     Fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.
10 327     If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,
10 328     Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.
10 329     O, gentlemen, see, see! Dead Henry's wounds
10 330     Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh.
10 331     Blush, blush, thou lump of foul deformity,
10 332     For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood
10 333     From cold and empty veins where no blood dwells;
10 334     Thy deeds inhuman and unnatural
10 335     Provokes this deluge most unnatural.
10 336     O God, which this blood mad'st, revenge his death!
10 337     O earth, which this blood drink'st, revenge his death!
10 338     Either, heav'n, with lightning strike the murd'rer dead;
10 339     Or, earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,
10 340     As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood,
10 341     Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered.
10 342   GLOUCESTER. Lady, you know no rules of charity,
10 343     Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.
10 344   ANNE. Villain, thou knowest nor law of God nor man:
10 345     No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.
10 346   GLOUCESTER. But I know none, and therefore am no beast.
10 347   ANNE. O wonderful, when devils tell the truth!
10 348   GLOUCESTER. More wonderful when angels are so angry.
10 349     Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,
10 350     Of these supposed crimes to give me leave
10 351     By circumstance but to acquit myself.
10 352   ANNE. Vouchsafe, diffus'd infection of a man,
10 353     Of these known evils but to give me leave
10 354     By circumstance to accuse thy cursed self.
10 355   GLOUCESTER. Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
10 356     Some patient leisure to excuse myself.
10 357   ANNE. Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make
10 358     No excuse current but to hang thyself.
10 359   GLOUCESTER. By such despair I should accuse myself.
10 360   ANNE. And by despairing shalt thou stand excused
10 361     For doing worthy vengeance on thyself
10 362     That didst unworthy slaughter upon others.
10 363   GLOUCESTER. Say that I slew them not?
10 364   ANNE. Then say they were not slain.
10 365     But dead they are, and, devilish slave, by thee.
10 366   GLOUCESTER. I did not kill your husband.
10 367   ANNE. Why, then he is alive.
10 368   GLOUCESTER. Nay, he is dead, and slain by Edward's hands.
10 369   ANNE. In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret saw
10 370     Thy murd'rous falchion smoking in his blood;
10 371     The which thou once didst bend against her breast,
10 372     But that thy brothers beat aside the point.
10 373   GLOUCESTER. I was provoked by her sland'rous tongue
10 374     That laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.
10 375   ANNE. Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind,
10 376     That never dream'st on aught but butcheries.
10 377     Didst thou not kill this king?
10 378   GLOUCESTER. I grant ye.
10 379   ANNE. Dost grant me, hedgehog? Then, God grant me to
10 380     Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!
10 381     O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous!
10 382   GLOUCESTER. The better for the King of Heaven, that hath
10 383     him.
10 384   ANNE. He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.
10 385   GLOUCESTER. Let him thank me that holp to send him
10 386     thither,
10 387     For he was fitter for that place than earth.
10 388   ANNE. And thou unfit for any place but hell.
10 389   GLOUCESTER. Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.
10 390   ANNE. Some dungeon.
10 391   GLOUCESTER. Your bed-chamber.
10 392   ANNE. Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest!
10 393   GLOUCESTER. So will it, madam, till I lie with you.
10 394   ANNE. I hope so.
10 395   GLOUCESTER. I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,
10 396     To leave this keen encounter of our wits,
10 397     And fall something into a slower method-
10 398     Is not the causer of the timeless deaths
10 399     Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,
10 400     As blameful as the executioner?
10 401   ANNE. Thou wast the cause and most accurs'd effect.
10 402   GLOUCESTER. Your beauty was the cause of that effect-
10 403     Your beauty that did haunt me in my sleep
10 404     To undertake the death of all the world
10 405     So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.
10 406   ANNE. If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,
10 407     These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.
10 408   GLOUCESTER. These eyes could not endure that beauty's
10 409     wreck;
10 410     You should not blemish it if I stood by.
10 411     As all the world is cheered by the sun,
10 412     So I by that; it is my day, my life.
10 413   ANNE. Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!
10 414   GLOUCESTER. Curse not thyself, fair creature; thou art both.
10 415   ANNE. I would I were, to be reveng'd on thee.
10 416   GLOUCESTER. It is a quarrel most unnatural,
10 417     To be reveng'd on him that loveth thee.
10 418   ANNE. It is a quarrel just and reasonable,
10 419     To be reveng'd on him that kill'd my husband.
10 420   GLOUCESTER. He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband
10 421     Did it to help thee to a better husband.
10 422   ANNE. His better doth not breathe upon the earth.
10 423   GLOUCESTER. He lives that loves thee better than he could.
10 424   ANNE. Name him.
10 425   GLOUCESTER. Plantagenet.
10 426   ANNE. Why, that was he.
10 427   GLOUCESTER. The self-same name, but one of better nature.
10 428   ANNE. Where is he?
10 429   GLOUCESTER. Here.  [She spits at him]  Why dost thou spit
10 430     at me?
10 431   ANNE. Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake!
10 432   GLOUCESTER. Never came poison from so sweet a place.
10 433   ANNE. Never hung poison on a fouler toad.
10 434     Out of my sight! Thou dost infect mine eyes.
10 435   GLOUCESTER. Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.
10 436   ANNE. Would they were basilisks to strike thee dead!
10 437   GLOUCESTER. I would they were, that I might die at once;
10 438     For now they kill me with a living death.
10 439     Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,
10 440     Sham'd their aspects with store of childish drops-
10 441     These eyes, which never shed remorseful tear,
10 442     No, when my father York and Edward wept
10 443     To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made
10 444     When black-fac'd Clifford shook his sword at him;
10 445     Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,
10 446     Told the sad story of my father's death,
10 447     And twenty times made pause to sob and weep
10 448     That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks
10 449     Like trees bedash'd with rain-in that sad time
10 450     My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;
10 451     And what these sorrows could not thence exhale
10 452     Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.
10 453     I never sued to friend nor enemy;
10 454     My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;
10 455     But, now thy beauty is propos'd my fee,
10 456     My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.
10 457                                    [She looks scornfully at him]
10 458     Teach not thy lip such scorn; for it was made
10 459     For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.
10 460     If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,
10 461     Lo here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;
10 462     Which if thou please to hide in this true breast
10 463     And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,
10 464     I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,
10 465     And humbly beg the death upon my knee.
10 466       [He lays his breast open; she offers at it with his sword]
10 467     Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry-
10 468     But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.
10 469     Nay, now dispatch; 'twas I that stabb'd young Edward-
10 470     But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.
10 471                                            [She falls the sword]
10 472     Take up the sword again, or take up me.
10 473   ANNE. Arise, dissembler; though I wish thy death,
10 474     I will not be thy executioner.
10 475   GLOUCESTER. Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it;
10 476   ANNE. I have already.
10 477   GLOUCESTER. That was in thy rage.
10 478     Speak it again, and even with the word
10 479     This hand, which for thy love did kill thy love,
10 480     Shall for thy love kill a far truer love;
10 481     To both their deaths shalt thou be accessary.
10 482   ANNE. I would I knew thy heart.
10 483   GLOUCESTER. 'Tis figur'd in my tongue.
10 484   ANNE. I fear me both are false.
10 485   GLOUCESTER. Then never was man true.
10 486   ANNE. well put up your sword.
10 487   GLOUCESTER. Say, then, my peace is made.
10 488   ANNE. That shalt thou know hereafter.
10 489   GLOUCESTER. But shall I live in hope?
10 490   ANNE. All men, I hope, live so.
10 491   GLOUCESTER. Vouchsafe to wear this ring.
10 492   ANNE. To take is not to give.               [Puts on the ring]
10 493   GLOUCESTER. Look how my ring encompasseth thy finger,
10 494     Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart;
10 495     Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.
10 496     And if thy poor devoted servant may
10 497     But beg one favour at thy gracious hand,
10 498     Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever.
10 499   ANNE. What is it?
10 500   GLOUCESTER. That it may please you leave these sad designs
10 501     To him that hath most cause to be a mourner,
10 502     And presently repair to Crosby House;
10 503     Where-after I have solemnly interr'd
10 504     At Chertsey monast'ry this noble king,
10 505     And wet his grave with my repentant tears-
10 506     I will with all expedient duty see you.
10 507     For divers unknown reasons, I beseech you,
10 508     Grant me this boon.
10 509   ANNE. With all my heart; and much it joys me too
10 510     To see you are become so penitent.
10 511     Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me.
10 512   GLOUCESTER. Bid me farewell.
10 513   ANNE. 'Tis more than you deserve;
10 514     But since you teach me how to flatter you,
10 515     Imagine I have said farewell already.
10 516                              Exeunt two GENTLEMEN With LADY ANNE
10 517   GLOUCESTER. Sirs, take up the corse.
10 518   GENTLEMEN. Towards Chertsey, noble lord?
10 519   GLOUCESTER. No, to White Friars; there attend my coming.
10 520                                        Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER
10 521     Was ever woman in this humour woo'd?
10 522     Was ever woman in this humour won?
10 523     I'll have her; but I will not keep her long.
10 524     What! I that kill'd her husband and his father-
10 525     To take her in her heart's extremest hate,
10 526     With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,
10 527     The bleeding witness of my hatred by;
10 528     Having God, her conscience, and these bars against me,
10 529     And I no friends to back my suit at all
10 530     But the plain devil and dissembling looks,
10 531     And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!
10 532     Ha!
10 533     Hath she forgot already that brave prince,
10 534     Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
10 535     Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury?
10 536     A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman-
10 537     Fram'd in the prodigality of nature,
10 538     Young, valiant, wise, and no doubt right royal-
10 539     The spacious world cannot again afford;
10 540     And will she yet abase her eyes on me,
10 541     That cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince
10 542     And made her widow to a woeful bed?
10 543     On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety?
10 544     On me, that halts and am misshapen thus?
10 545     My dukedom to a beggarly denier,
10 546     I do mistake my person all this while.
10 547     Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot,
10 548     Myself to be a marv'llous proper man.
10 549     I'll be at charges for a looking-glass,
10 550     And entertain a score or two of tailors
10 551     To study fashions to adorn my body.
10 552     Since I am crept in favour with myself,
10 553     I will maintain it with some little cost.
10 554     But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave,
10 555     And then return lamenting to my love.
10 556     Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,
10 557     That I may see my shadow as I pass.                     Exit
10 558 
10 559 
10 560 
10 561 
10 562 SCENE 3.
10 563 
10 564 London. The palace
10 565 
10 566 Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH, LORD RIVERS, and LORD GREY
10 567 
10 568   RIVERS. Have patience, madam; there's no doubt his Majesty
10 569     Will soon recover his accustom'd health.
10 570   GREY. In that you brook it ill, it makes him worse;
10 571     Therefore, for God's sake, entertain good comfort,
10 572     And cheer his Grace with quick and merry eyes.
10 573   QUEEN ELIZABETH. If he were dead, what would betide on
10 574     me?
10 575   GREY. No other harm but loss of such a lord.
10 576   QUEEN ELIZABETH. The loss of such a lord includes all
10 577     harms.
10 578   GREY. The heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son
10 579     To be your comforter when he is gone.
10 580   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Ah, he is young; and his minority
10 581     Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,
10 582     A man that loves not me, nor none of you.
10 583   RIVER. Is it concluded he shall be Protector?
10 584   QUEEN ELIZABETH. It is determin'd, not concluded yet;
10 585     But so it must be, if the King miscarry.
10 586 
10 587                      Enter BUCKINGHAM and DERBY
10 588 
10 589   GREY. Here come the Lords of Buckingham and Derby.
10 590   BUCKINGHAM. Good time of day unto your royal Grace!
10 591   DERBY. God make your Majesty joyful as you have been.
10 592   QUEEN ELIZABETH. The Countess Richmond, good my Lord
10 593     of Derby,
10 594     To your good prayer will scarcely say amen.
10 595     Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she's your wife
10 596     And loves not me, be you, good lord, assur'd
10 597     I hate not you for her proud arrogance.
10 598   DERBY. I do beseech you, either not believe
10 599     The envious slanders of her false accusers;
10 600     Or, if she be accus'd on true report,
10 601     Bear with her weakness, which I think proceeds
10 602     From wayward sickness and no grounded malice.
10 603   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Saw you the King to-day, my Lord of
10 604     Derby?
10 605   DERBY. But now the Duke of Buckingham and I
10 606     Are come from visiting his Majesty.
10 607   QUEEN ELIZABETH. What likelihood of his amendment,
10 608     Lords?
10 609   BUCKINGHAM. Madam, good hope; his Grace speaks
10 610     cheerfully.
10 611   QUEEN ELIZABETH. God grant him health! Did you confer
10 612     with him?
10 613   BUCKINGHAM. Ay, madam; he desires to make atonement
10 614     Between the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers,
10 615     And between them and my Lord Chamberlain;
10 616     And sent to warn them to his royal presence.
10 617   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Would all were well! But that will
10 618     never be.
10 619     I fear our happiness is at the height.
10 620 
10 621               Enter GLOUCESTER, HASTINGS, and DORSET
10 622 
10 623   GLOUCESTER. They do me wrong, and I will not endure it.
10 624     Who is it that complains unto the King
10 625     That I, forsooth, am stern and love them not?
10 626     By holy Paul, they love his Grace but lightly
10 627     That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours.
10 628     Because I cannot flatter and look fair,
10 629     Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive, and cog,
10 630     Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,
10 631     I must be held a rancorous enemy.
10 632     Cannot a plain man live and think no harm
10 633     But thus his simple truth must be abus'd
10 634     With silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?
10 635   GREY. To who in all this presence speaks your Grace?
10 636   GLOUCESTER. To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.
10 637     When have I injur'd thee? when done thee wrong,
10 638     Or thee, or thee, or any of your faction?
10 639     A plague upon you all! His royal Grace-
10 640     Whom God preserve better than you would wish!-
10 641     Cannot be quiet searce a breathing while
10 642     But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.
10 643   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the
10 644     matter.
10 645     The King, on his own royal disposition
10 646     And not provok'd by any suitor else-
10 647     Aiming, belike, at your interior hatred
10 648     That in your outward action shows itself
10 649     Against my children, brothers, and myself-
10 650     Makes him to send that he may learn the ground.
10 651   GLOUCESTER. I cannot tell; the world is grown so bad
10 652     That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch.
10 653     Since every Jack became a gentleman,
10 654     There's many a gentle person made a Jack.
10 655   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Come, come, we know your meaning,
10 656     brother Gloucester:
10 657     You envy my advancement and my friends';
10 658     God grant we never may have need of you!
10 659   GLOUCESTER. Meantime, God grants that I have need of you.
10 660     Our brother is imprison'd by your means,
10 661     Myself disgrac'd, and the nobility
10 662     Held in contempt; while great promotions
10 663     Are daily given to ennoble those
10 664     That scarce some two days since were worth a noble.
10 665   QUEEN ELIZABETH. By Him that rais'd me to this careful
10 666     height
10 667     From that contented hap which I enjoy'd,
10 668     I never did incense his Majesty
10 669     Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been
10 670     An earnest advocate to plead for him.
10 671     My lord, you do me shameful injury
10 672     Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.
10 673   GLOUCESTER. You may deny that you were not the mean
10 674     Of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment.
10 675   RIVERS. She may, my lord; for-
10 676   GLOUCESTER. She may, Lord Rivers? Why, who knows
10 677     not so?
10 678     She may do more, sir, than denying that:
10 679     She may help you to many fair preferments
10 680     And then deny her aiding hand therein,
10 681     And lay those honours on your high desert.
10 682     What may she not? She may-ay, marry, may she-
10 683   RIVERS. What, marry, may she?
10 684   GLOUCESTER. What, marry, may she? Marry with a king,
10 685     A bachelor, and a handsome stripling too.
10 686     Iwis your grandam had a worser match.
10 687   QUEEN ELIZABETH. My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long
10 688     borne
10 689     Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs.
10 690     By heaven, I will acquaint his Majesty
10 691     Of those gross taunts that oft I have endur'd.
10 692     I had rather be a country servant-maid
10 693     Than a great queen with this condition-
10 694     To be so baited, scorn'd, and stormed at.
10 695 
10 696                 Enter old QUEEN MARGARET, behind
10 697 
10 698     Small joy have I in being England's Queen.
10 699   QUEEN MARGARET. And less'ned be that small, God, I
10 700     beseech Him!
10 701     Thy honour, state, and seat, is due to me.
10 702   GLOUCESTER. What! Threat you me with telling of the
10 703     King?
10 704     Tell him and spare not. Look what I have said
10 705     I will avouch't in presence of the King.
10 706     I dare adventure to be sent to th' Tow'r.
10 707     'Tis time to speak-my pains are quite forgot.
10 708   QUEEN MARGARET. Out, devil! I do remember them to
10 709     well:
10 710     Thou kill'dst my husband Henry in the Tower,
10 711     And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury.
10 712   GLOUCESTER. Ere you were queen, ay, or your husband
10 713     King,
10 714     I was a pack-horse in his great affairs,
10 715     A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,
10 716     A liberal rewarder of his friends;
10 717     To royalize his blood I spent mine own.
10 718   QUEEN MARGARET. Ay, and much better blood than his or
10 719     thine.
10 720   GLOUCESTER. In all which time you and your husband Grey
10 721     Were factious for the house of Lancaster;
10 722     And, Rivers, so were you. Was not your husband
10 723     In Margaret's battle at Saint Albans slain?
10 724     Let me put in your minds, if you forget,
10 725     What you have been ere this, and what you are;
10 726     Withal, what I have been, and what I am.
10 727   QUEEN MARGARET. A murd'rous villain, and so still thou art.
10 728   GLOUCESTER. Poor Clarence did forsake his father, Warwick,
10 729     Ay, and forswore himself-which Jesu pardon!-
10 730   QUEEN MARGARET. Which God revenge!
10 731   GLOUCESTER. To fight on Edward's party for the crown;
10 732     And for his meed, poor lord, he is mewed up.
10 733     I would to God my heart were flint like Edward's,
10 734     Or Edward's soft and pitiful like mine.
10 735     I am too childish-foolish for this world.
10 736   QUEEN MARGARET. Hie thee to hell for shame and leave this
10 737     world,
10 738     Thou cacodemon; there thy kingdom is.
10 739   RIVERS. My Lord of Gloucester, in those busy days
10 740     Which here you urge to prove us enemies,
10 741     We follow'd then our lord, our sovereign king.
10 742     So should we you, if you should be our king.
10 743   GLOUCESTER. If I should be! I had rather be a pedlar.
10 744     Far be it from my heart, the thought thereof!
10 745   QUEEN ELIZABETH. As little joy, my lord, as you suppose
10 746     You should enjoy were you this country's king,
10 747     As little joy you may suppose in me
10 748     That I enjoy, being the Queen thereof.
10 749   QUEEN MARGARET. As little joy enjoys the Queen thereof;
10 750     For I am she, and altogether joyless.
10 751     I can no longer hold me patient.                 [Advancing]
10 752     Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out
10 753     In sharing that which you have pill'd from me.
10 754     Which of you trembles not that looks on me?
10 755     If not that, I am Queen, you bow like subjects,
10 756     Yet that, by you depos'd, you quake like rebels?
10 757     Ah, gentle villain, do not turn away!
10 758   GLOUCESTER. Foul wrinkled witch, what mak'st thou in my
10 759     sight?
10 760   QUEEN MARGARET. But repetition of what thou hast marr'd,
10 761     That will I make before I let thee go.
10 762   GLOUCESTER. Wert thou not banished on pain of death?
10 763   QUEEN MARGARET. I was; but I do find more pain in
10 764     banishment
10 765     Than death can yield me here by my abode.
10 766     A husband and a son thou ow'st to me;
10 767     And thou a kingdom; all of you allegiance.
10 768     This sorrow that I have by right is yours;
10 769     And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.
10 770   GLOUCESTER. The curse my noble father laid on thee,
10 771     When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper
10 772     And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes,
10 773     And then to dry them gav'st the Duke a clout
10 774     Steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland-
10 775     His curses then from bitterness of soul
10 776     Denounc'd against thee are all fall'n upon thee;
10 777     And God, not we, hath plagu'd thy bloody deed.
10 778   QUEEN ELIZABETH. So just is God to right the innocent.
10 779   HASTINGS. O, 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe,
10 780     And the most merciless that e'er was heard of!
10 781   RIVERS. Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.
10 782   DORSET. No man but prophesied revenge for it.
10 783   BUCKINGHAM. Northumberland, then present, wept to see it.
10 784   QUEEN MARGARET. What, were you snarling all before I came,
10 785     Ready to catch each other by the throat,
10 786     And turn you all your hatred now on me?
10 787     Did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven
10 788     That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death,
10 789     Their kingdom's loss, my woeful banishment,
10 790     Should all but answer for that peevish brat?
10 791     Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?
10 792     Why then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!
10 793     Though not by war, by surfeit die your king,
10 794     As ours by murder, to make him a king!
10 795     Edward thy son, that now is Prince of Wales,
10 796     For Edward our son, that was Prince of Wales,
10 797     Die in his youth by like untimely violence!
10 798     Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,
10 799     Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self!
10 800     Long mayest thou live to wail thy children's death,
10 801     And see another, as I see thee now,
10 802     Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine!
10 803     Long die thy happy days before thy death;
10 804     And, after many length'ned hours of grief,
10 805     Die neither mother, wife, nor England's Queen!
10 806     Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by,
10 807     And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son
10 808     Was stabb'd with bloody daggers. God, I pray him,
10 809     That none of you may live his natural age,
10 810     But by some unlook'd accident cut off!
10 811   GLOUCESTER. Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd
10 812     hag.
10 813   QUEEN MARGARET. And leave out thee? Stay, dog, for thou
10 814     shalt hear me.
10 815     If heaven have any grievous plague in store
10 816     Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee,
10 817     O, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe,
10 818     And then hurl down their indignation
10 819     On thee, the troubler of the poor world's peace!
10 820     The worm of conscience still be-gnaw thy soul!
10 821     Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou liv'st,
10 822     And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends!
10 823     No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine,
10 824     Unless it be while some tormenting dream
10 825     Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils!
10 826     Thou elvish-mark'd, abortive, rooting hog,
10 827     Thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity
10 828     The slave of nature and the son of hell,
10 829     Thou slander of thy heavy mother's womb,
10 830     Thou loathed issue of thy father's loins,
10 831     Thou rag of honour, thou detested-
10 832   GLOUCESTER. Margaret!
10 833   QUEEN MARGARET. Richard!
10 834   GLOUCESTER. Ha?
10 835   QUEEN MARGARET. I call thee not.
10 836   GLOUCESTER. I cry thee mercy then, for I did think
10 837     That thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names.
10 838   QUEEN MARGARET. Why, so I did, but look'd for no reply.
10 839     O, let me make the period to my curse!
10 840   GLOUCESTER. 'Tis done by me, and ends in-Margaret.
10 841   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Thus have you breath'd your curse
10 842     against yourself.
10 843   QUEEN MARGARET. Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my
10 844     fortune!
10 845     Why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider
10 846     Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?
10 847     Fool, fool! thou whet'st a knife to kill thyself.
10 848     The day will come that thou shalt wish for me
10 849     To help thee curse this poisonous bunch-back'd toad.
10 850   HASTINGS. False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse,
10 851     Lest to thy harm thou move our patience.
10 852   QUEEN MARGARET. Foul shame upon you! you have all
10 853     mov'd mine.
10 854   RIVERS. Were you well serv'd, you would be taught your
10 855       duty.
10 856   QUEEN MARGARET. To serve me well you all should do me
10 857     duty,
10 858     Teach me to be your queen and you my subjects.
10 859     O, serve me well, and teach yourselves that duty!
10 860   DORSET. Dispute not with her; she is lunatic.
10 861   QUEEN MARGARET. Peace, Master Marquis, you are malapert;
10 862     Your fire-new stamp of honour is scarce current.
10 863     O, that your young nobility could judge
10 864     What 'twere to lose it and be miserable!
10 865     They that stand high have many blasts to shake them,
10 866     And if they fall they dash themselves to pieces.
10 867   GLOUCESTER. Good counsel, marry; learn it, learn it, Marquis.
10 868   DORSET. It touches you, my lord, as much as me.
10 869   GLOUCESTER. Ay, and much more; but I was born so high,
10 870     Our aery buildeth in the cedar's top,
10 871     And dallies with the wind, and scorns the sun.
10 872   QUEEN MARGARET. And turns the sun to shade-alas! alas!
10 873     Witness my son, now in the shade of death,
10 874     Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath
10 875     Hath in eternal darkness folded up.
10 876     Your aery buildeth in our aery's nest.
10 877     O God that seest it, do not suffer it;
10 878     As it is won with blood, lost be it so!
10 879   BUCKINGHAM. Peace, peace, for shame, if not for charity!
10 880   QUEEN MARGARET. Urge neither charity nor shame to me.
10 881     Uncharitably with me have you dealt,
10 882     And shamefully my hopes by you are butcher'd.
10 883     My charity is outrage, life my shame;
10 884     And in that shame still live my sorrow's rage!
10 885   BUCKINGHAM. Have done, have done.
10 886   QUEEN MARGARET. O princely Buckingham, I'll kiss thy
10 887     hand
10 888     In sign of league and amity with thee.
10 889     Now fair befall thee and thy noble house!
10 890     Thy garments are not spotted with our blood,
10 891     Nor thou within the compass of my curse.
10 892   BUCKINGHAM. Nor no one here; for curses never pass
10 893     The lips of those that breathe them in the air.
10 894   QUEEN MARGARET. I will not think but they ascend the sky
10 895     And there awake God's gentle-sleeping peace.
10 896     O Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog!
10 897     Look when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites,
10 898     His venom tooth will rankle to the death:
10 899     Have not to do with him, beware of him;
10 900     Sin, death, and hell, have set their marks on him,
10 901     And all their ministers attend on him.
10 902   GLOUCESTER. What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham?
10 903   BUCKINGHAM. Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.
10 904   QUEEN MARGARET. What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle
10 905     counsel,
10 906     And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?
10 907     O, but remember this another day,
10 908     When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow,
10 909     And say poor Margaret was a prophetess!
10 910     Live each of you the subjects to his hate,
10 911     And he to yours, and all of you to God's!               Exit
10 912   BUCKINGHAM. My hair doth stand an end to hear her curses.
10 913   RIVERS. And so doth mine. I muse why she's at liberty.
10 914   GLOUCESTER. I cannot blame her; by God's holy Mother,
10 915     She hath had too much wrong; and I repent
10 916     My part thereof that I have done to her.
10 917   QUEEN ELIZABETH. I never did her any to my knowledge.
10 918   GLOUCESTER. Yet you have all the vantage of her wrong.
10 919     I was too hot to do somebody good
10 920     That is too cold in thinking of it now.
10 921     Marry, as for Clarence, he is well repaid;
10 922     He is frank'd up to fatting for his pains;
10 923     God pardon them that are the cause thereof!
10 924   RIVERS. A virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion,
10 925     To pray for them that have done scathe to us!
10 926   GLOUCESTER. So do I ever-  [Aside]  being well advis'd;
10 927     For had I curs'd now, I had curs'd myself.
10 928 
10 929                          Enter CATESBY
10 930 
10 931   CATESBY. Madam, his Majesty doth can for you,
10 932     And for your Grace, and you, my gracious lords.
10 933   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Catesby, I come. Lords, will you go
10 934     with me?
10 935   RIVERS. We wait upon your Grace.
10 936                                        Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER
10 937   GLOUCESTER. I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.
10 938     The secret mischiefs that I set abroach
10 939     I lay unto the grievous charge of others.
10 940     Clarence, who I indeed have cast in darkness,
10 941     I do beweep to many simple gulls;
10 942     Namely, to Derby, Hastings, Buckingham;
10 943     And tell them 'tis the Queen and her allies
10 944     That stir the King against the Duke my brother.
10 945     Now they believe it, and withal whet me
10 946     To be reveng'd on Rivers, Dorset, Grey;
10 947     But then I sigh and, with a piece of Scripture,
10 948     Tell them that God bids us do good for evil.
10 949     And thus I clothe my naked villainy
10 950     With odd old ends stol'n forth of holy writ,
10 951     And seem a saint when most I play the devil.
10 952 
10 953                        Enter two MURDERERS
10 954 
10 955     But, soft, here come my executioners.
10 956     How now, my hardy stout resolved mates!
10 957     Are you now going to dispatch this thing?
10 958   FIRST MURDERER. We are, my lord, and come to have the
10 959     warrant,
10 960     That we may be admitted where he is.
10 961   GLOUCESTER. Well thought upon; I have it here about me.
10 962                                              [Gives the warrant]
10 963     When you have done, repair to Crosby Place.
10 964     But, sirs, be sudden in the execution,
10 965     Withal obdurate, do not hear him plead;
10 966     For Clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps
10 967     May move your hearts to pity, if you mark him.
10 968   FIRST MURDERER. Tut, tut, my lord, we will not stand to
10 969     prate;
10 970     Talkers are no good doers. Be assur'd
10 971     We go to use our hands and not our tongues.
10 972   GLOUCESTER. Your eyes drop millstones when fools' eyes fall
10 973     tears.
10 974     I like you, lads; about your business straight;
10 975     Go, go, dispatch.
10 976   FIRST MURDERER. We will, my noble lord.                 Exeunt
10 977 
10 978 
10 979 
10 980 
10 981 SCENE 4.
10 982 
10 983 London. The Tower
10 984 
10 985 Enter CLARENCE and KEEPER
10 986 
10 987   KEEPER. Why looks your Grace so heavily to-day?
10 988   CLARENCE. O, I have pass'd a miserable night,
10 989     So full of fearful dreams, of ugly sights,
10 990     That, as I am a Christian faithful man,
10 991     I would not spend another such a night
10 992     Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days-
10 993     So full of dismal terror was the time!
10 994   KEEPER. What was your dream, my lord? I pray you
10 995     tell me.
10 996   CLARENCE. Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower
10 997     And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy;
10 998     And in my company my brother Gloucester,
10 999     Who from my cabin tempted me to walk
10 1000     Upon the hatches. Thence we look'd toward England,
10 1001     And cited up a thousand heavy times,
10 1002     During the wars of York and Lancaster,
10 1003     That had befall'n us. As we pac'd along
10 1004     Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,
10 1005     Methought that Gloucester stumbled, and in falling
10 1006     Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard
10 1007     Into the tumbling billows of the main.
10 1008     O Lord, methought what pain it was to drown,
10 1009     What dreadful noise of waters in my ears,
10 1010     What sights of ugly death within my eyes!
10 1011     Methoughts I saw a thousand fearful wrecks,
10 1012     A thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon,
10 1013     Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,
10 1014     Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,
10 1015     All scatt'red in the bottom of the sea;
10 1016     Some lay in dead men's skulls, and in the holes
10 1017     Where eyes did once inhabit there were crept,
10 1018     As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,
10 1019     That woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep
10 1020     And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatt'red by.
10 1021   KEEPER. Had you such leisure in the time of death
10 1022     To gaze upon these secrets of the deep?
10 1023   CLARENCE. Methought I had; and often did I strive
10 1024     To yield the ghost, but still the envious flood
10 1025     Stopp'd in my soul and would not let it forth
10 1026     To find the empty, vast, and wand'ring air;
10 1027     But smother'd it within my panting bulk,
10 1028     Who almost burst to belch it in the sea.
10 1029   KEEPER. Awak'd you not in this sore agony?
10 1030   CLARENCE. No, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life.
10 1031     O, then began the tempest to my soul!
10 1032     I pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood
10 1033     With that sour ferryman which poets write of,
10 1034     Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.
10 1035     The first that there did greet my stranger soul
10 1036     Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick,
10 1037     Who spake aloud 'What scourge for perjury
10 1038     Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?'
10 1039     And so he vanish'd. Then came wand'ring by
10 1040     A shadow like an angel, with bright hair
10 1041     Dabbled in blood, and he shriek'd out aloud
10 1042     'Clarence is come-false, fleeting, perjur'd Clarence,
10 1043     That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury.
10 1044     Seize on him, Furies, take him unto torment!'
10 1045     With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends
10 1046     Environ'd me, and howled in mine ears
10 1047     Such hideous cries that, with the very noise,
10 1048     I trembling wak'd, and for a season after
10 1049     Could not believe but that I was in hell,
10 1050     Such terrible impression made my dream.
10 1051   KEEPER. No marvel, lord, though it affrighted you;
10 1052     I am afraid, methinks, to hear you tell it.
10 1053   CLARENCE. Ah, Keeper, Keeper, I have done these things
10 1054     That now give evidence against my soul
10 1055     For Edward's sake, and see how he requites me!
10 1056     O God! If my deep prayers cannot appease Thee,
10 1057     But Thou wilt be aveng'd on my misdeeds,
10 1058     Yet execute Thy wrath in me alone;
10 1059     O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!
10 1060     Keeper, I prithee sit by me awhile;
10 1061     My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.
10 1062   KEEPER. I will, my lord. God give your Grace good rest.
10 1063                                                [CLARENCE sleeps]
10 1064 
10 1065                   Enter BRAKENBURY the Lieutenant
10 1066 
10 1067   BRAKENBURY. Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,
10 1068     Makes the night morning and the noontide night.
10 1069     Princes have but their titles for their glories,
10 1070     An outward honour for an inward toil;
10 1071     And for unfelt imaginations
10 1072     They often feel a world of restless cares,
10 1073     So that between their tides and low name
10 1074     There's nothing differs but the outward fame.
10 1075 
10 1076                       Enter the two MURDERERS
10 1077 
10 1078   FIRST MURDERER. Ho! who's here?
10 1079   BRAKENBURY. What wouldst thou, fellow, and how cam'st
10 1080     thou hither?
10 1081   FIRST MURDERER. I would speak with Clarence, and I came
10 1082     hither on my legs.
10 1083   BRAKENBURY. What, so brief?
10 1084   SECOND MURDERER. 'Tis better, sir, than to be tedious. Let
10 1085     him see our commission and talk no more.
10 1086                                            [BRAKENBURY reads it]
10 1087   BRAKENBURY. I am, in this, commanded to deliver
10 1088     The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands.
10 1089     I will not reason what is meant hereby,
10 1090     Because I will be guiltless from the meaning.
10 1091     There lies the Duke asleep; and there the keys.
10 1092     I'll to the King and signify to him
10 1093     That thus I have resign'd to you my charge.
10 1094   FIRST MURDERER. You may, sir; 'tis a point of wisdom. Fare
10 1095     you well.                       Exeunt BRAKENBURY and KEEPER
10 1096   SECOND MURDERER. What, shall I stab him as he sleeps?
10 1097   FIRST MURDERER. No; he'll say 'twas done cowardly, when
10 1098     he wakes.
10 1099   SECOND MURDERER. Why, he shall never wake until the great
10 1100     judgment-day.
10 1101   FIRST MURDERER. Why, then he'll say we stabb'd him
10 1102     sleeping.
10 1103   SECOND MURDERER. The urging of that word judgment hath
10 1104     bred a kind of remorse in me.
10 1105   FIRST MURDERER. What, art thou afraid?
10 1106   SECOND MURDERER. Not to kill him, having a warrant; but to
10 1107     be damn'd for killing him, from the which no warrant can
10 1108     defend me.
10 1109   FIRST MURDERER. I thought thou hadst been resolute.
10 1110   SECOND MURDERER. So I am, to let him live.
10 1111   FIRST MURDERER. I'll back to the Duke of Gloucester and
10 1112     tell him so.
10 1113   SECOND MURDERER. Nay, I prithee, stay a little. I hope this
10 1114     passionate humour of mine will change; it was wont to
10 1115     hold me but while one tells twenty.
10 1116   FIRST MURDERER. How dost thou feel thyself now?
10 1117     SECOND MURDERER. Faith, some certain dregs of conscience
10 1118     are yet within me.
10 1119   FIRST MURDERER. Remember our reward, when the deed's
10 1120     done.
10 1121   SECOND MURDERER. Zounds, he dies; I had forgot the reward.
10 1122   FIRST MURDERER. Where's thy conscience now?
10 1123   SECOND MURDERER. O, in the Duke of Gloucester's purse!
10 1124   FIRST MURDERER. When he opens his purse to give us our
10 1125     reward, thy conscience flies out.
10 1126   SECOND MURDERER. 'Tis no matter; let it go; there's few or
10 1127     none will entertain it.
10 1128   FIRST MURDERER. What if it come to thee again?
10 1129   SECOND MURDERER. I'll not meddle with it-it makes a man
10 1130     coward: a man cannot steal, but it accuseth him; a man
10 1131     cannot swear, but it checks him; a man cannot lie with his
10 1132     neighbour's wife, but it detects him. 'Tis a blushing shame-
10 1133     fac'd spirit that mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills a man
10 1134     full of obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold
10 1135     that-by chance I found. It beggars any man that keeps it.
10 1136     It is turn'd out of towns and cities for a dangerous thing;
10 1137     and every man that means to live well endeavours to trust
10 1138     to himself and live without it.
10 1139   FIRST MURDERER. Zounds, 'tis even now at my elbow,
10 1140     persuading me not to kill the Duke.
10 1141   SECOND MURDERER. Take the devil in thy mind and believe
10 1142     him not; he would insinuate with thee but to make the
10 1143     sigh.
10 1144   FIRST MURDERER. I am strong-fram'd; he cannot prevail with
10 1145     me.
10 1146   SECOND MURDERER. Spoke like a tall man that respects thy
10 1147     reputation. Come, shall we fall to work?
10 1148   FIRST MURDERER. Take him on the costard with the hilts of
10 1149     thy sword, and then chop him in the malmsey-butt in the
10 1150     next room.
10 1151   SECOND MURDERER. O excellent device! and make a sop of
10 1152     him.
10 1153   FIRST MURDERER. Soft! he wakes.
10 1154   SECOND MURDERER. Strike!
10 1155   FIRST MURDERER. No, we'll reason with him.
10 1156   CLARENCE. Where art thou, Keeper? Give me a cup of wine.
10 1157   SECOND MURDERER. You shall have wine enough, my lord,
10 1158     anon.
10 1159   CLARENCE. In God's name, what art thou?
10 1160   FIRST MURDERER. A man, as you are.
10 1161   CLARENCE. But not as I am, royal.
10 1162   SECOND MURDERER. Nor you as we are, loyal.
10 1163   CLARENCE. Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.
10 1164   FIRST MURDERER. My voice is now the King's, my looks
10 1165     mine own.
10 1166   CLARENCE. How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!
10 1167     Your eyes do menace me. Why look you pale?
10 1168     Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?
10 1169   SECOND MURDERER. To, to, to-
10 1170   CLARENCE. To murder me?
10 1171   BOTH MURDERERS. Ay, ay.
10 1172   CLARENCE. You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,
10 1173     And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.
10 1174     Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?
10 1175   FIRST MURDERER. Offended us you have not, but the King.
10 1176   CLARENCE. I shall be reconcil'd to him again.
10 1177   SECOND MURDERER. Never, my lord; therefore prepare to die.
10 1178   CLARENCE. Are you drawn forth among a world of men
10 1179     To slay the innocent? What is my offence?
10 1180     Where is the evidence that doth accuse me?
10 1181     What lawful quest have given their verdict up
10 1182     Unto the frowning judge, or who pronounc'd
10 1183     The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death?
10 1184     Before I be convict by course of law,
10 1185     To threaten me with death is most unlawful.
10 1186     I charge you, as you hope to have redemption
10 1187     By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins,
10 1188     That you depart and lay no hands on me.
10 1189     The deed you undertake is damnable.
10 1190   FIRST MURDERER. What we will do, we do upon command.
10 1191   SECOND MURDERER. And he that hath commanded is our
10 1192     King.
10 1193   CLARENCE. Erroneous vassals! the great King of kings
10 1194     Hath in the tables of his law commanded
10 1195     That thou shalt do no murder. Will you then
10 1196     Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's?
10 1197     Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hand
10 1198     To hurl upon their heads that break his law.
10 1199   SECOND MURDERER. And that same vengeance doth he hurl
10 1200     on thee
10 1201     For false forswearing, and for murder too;
10 1202     Thou didst receive the sacrament to fight
10 1203     In quarrel of the house of Lancaster.
10 1204   FIRST MURDERER. And like a traitor to the name of God
10 1205     Didst break that vow; and with thy treacherous blade
10 1206     Unripp'dst the bowels of thy sov'reign's son.
10 1207   SECOND MURDERER. Whom thou wast sworn to cherish and
10 1208     defend.
10 1209   FIRST MURDERER. How canst thou urge God's dreadful law
10 1210     to us,
10 1211     When thou hast broke it in such dear degree?
10 1212   CLARENCE. Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed?
10 1213     For Edward, for my brother, for his sake.
10 1214     He sends you not to murder me for this,
10 1215     For in that sin he is as deep as I.
10 1216     If God will be avenged for the deed,
10 1217     O, know you yet He doth it publicly.
10 1218     Take not the quarrel from His pow'rful arm;
10 1219     He needs no indirect or lawless course
10 1220     To cut off those that have offended Him.
10 1221   FIRST MURDERER. Who made thee then a bloody minister
10 1222     When gallant-springing brave Plantagenet,
10 1223     That princely novice, was struck dead by thee?
10 1224   CLARENCE. My brother's love, the devil, and my rage.
10 1225   FIRST MURDERER. Thy brother's love, our duty, and thy
10 1226     faults,
10 1227     Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee.
10 1228   CLARENCE. If you do love my brother, hate not me;
10 1229     I am his brother, and I love him well.
10 1230     If you are hir'd for meed, go back again,
10 1231     And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,
10 1232     Who shall reward you better for my life
10 1233     Than Edward will for tidings of my death.
10 1234   SECOND MURDERER. You are deceiv'd: your brother Gloucester
10 1235     hates you.
10 1236   CLARENCE. O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear.
10 1237     Go you to him from me.
10 1238   FIRST MURDERER. Ay, so we will.
10 1239   CLARENCE. Tell him when that our princely father York
10 1240     Bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm
10 1241     And charg'd us from his soul to love each other,
10 1242     He little thought of this divided friendship.
10 1243     Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep.
10 1244   FIRST MURDERER. Ay, millstones; as he lesson'd us to weep.
10 1245   CLARENCE. O, do not slander him, for he is kind.
10 1246   FIRST MURDERER. Right, as snow in harvest. Come, you
10 1247     deceive yourself:
10 1248     'Tis he that sends us to destroy you here.
10 1249     CLARENCE. It cannot be; for he bewept my fortune
10 1250     And hugg'd me in his arms, and swore with sobs
10 1251     That he would labour my delivery.
10 1252   FIRST MURDERER. Why, so he doth, when he delivers you
10 1253     From this earth's thraldom to the joys of heaven.
10 1254   SECOND MURDERER. Make peace with God, for you must die,
10 1255     my lord.
10 1256   CLARENCE. Have you that holy feeling in your souls
10 1257     To counsel me to make my peace with God,
10 1258     And are you yet to your own souls so blind
10 1259     That you will war with God by murd'ring me?
10 1260     O, sirs, consider: they that set you on
10 1261     To do this deed will hate you for the deed.
10 1262   SECOND MURDERER. What shall we do?
10 1263   CLARENCE. Relent, and save your souls.
10 1264   FIRST MURDERER. Relent! No, 'tis cowardly and womanish.
10 1265   CLARENCE. Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish.
10 1266     Which of you, if you were a prince's son,
10 1267     Being pent from liberty as I am now,
10 1268     If two such murderers as yourselves came to you,
10 1269     Would not entreat for life?
10 1270     My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks;
10 1271     O, if thine eye be not a flatterer,
10 1272     Come thou on my side and entreat for me-
10 1273     As you would beg were you in my distress.
10 1274     A begging prince what beggar pities not?
10 1275   SECOND MURDERER. Look behind you, my lord.
10 1276   FIRST MURDERER.  [Stabbing him]  Take that, and that. If all
10 1277     this will not do,
10 1278     I'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within.
10 1279                                               Exit with the body
10 1280   SECOND MURDERER. A bloody deed, and desperately
10 1281     dispatch'd!
10 1282     How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands
10 1283     Of this most grievous murder!
10 1284 
10 1285                        Re-enter FIRST MURDERER
10 1286 
10 1287   FIRST MURDERER-How now, what mean'st thou that thou
10 1288     help'st me not?
10 1289     By heavens, the Duke shall know how slack you have
10 1290     been!
10 1291   SECOND MURDERER. I would he knew that I had sav'd his
10 1292     brother!
10 1293     Take thou the fee, and tell him what I say;
10 1294     For I repent me that the Duke is slain.                 Exit
10 1295   FIRST MURDERER. So do not I. Go, coward as thou art.
10 1296     Well, I'll go hide the body in some hole,
10 1297     Till that the Duke give order for his burial;
10 1298     And when I have my meed, I will away;
10 1299     For this will out, and then I must not stay.            Exit
10 1300 
10 1301

10 1315 ACT II. SCENE 1.
10 1316 
10 1317 London. The palace
10 1318 
10 1319 Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD sick, QUEEN ELIZABETH, DORSET,
10 1320 RIVERS,
10 1321 HASTINGS, BUCKINGHAM, GREY, and others
10 1322 
10 1323   KING EDWARD. Why, so. Now have I done a good day's
10 1324     work.
10 1325     You peers, continue this united league.
10 1326     I every day expect an embassage
10 1327     From my Redeemer to redeem me hence;
10 1328     And more at peace my soul shall part to heaven,
10 1329     Since I have made my friends at peace on earth.
10 1330     Hastings and Rivers, take each other's hand;
10 1331     Dissemble not your hatred, swear your love.
10 1332   RIVERS. By heaven, my soul is purg'd from grudging hate;
10 1333     And with my hand I seal my true heart's love.
10 1334   HASTINGS. So thrive I, as I truly swear the like!
10 1335   KING EDWARD. Take heed you dally not before your king;
10 1336     Lest He that is the supreme King of kings
10 1337     Confound your hidden falsehood and award
10 1338     Either of you to be the other's end.
10 1339   HASTINGS. So prosper I, as I swear perfect love!
10 1340   RIVERS. And I, as I love Hastings with my heart!
10 1341   KING EDWARD. Madam, yourself is not exempt from this;
10 1342     Nor you, son Dorset; Buckingham, nor you:
10 1343     You have been factious one against the other.
10 1344     Wife, love Lord Hastings, let him kiss your hand;
10 1345     And what you do, do it unfeignedly.
10 1346   QUEEN ELIZABETH. There, Hastings; I will never more
10 1347     remember
10 1348     Our former hatred, so thrive I and mine!
10 1349   KING EDWARD. Dorset, embrace him; Hastings, love Lord
10 1350     Marquis.
10 1351   DORSET. This interchange of love, I here protest,
10 1352     Upon my part shall be inviolable.
10 1353   HASTINGS. And so swear I.                       [They embrace]
10 1354   KING EDWARD. Now, princely Buckingham, seal thou this
10 1355     league
10 1356     With thy embracements to my wife's allies,
10 1357     And make me happy in your unity.
10 1358   BUCKINGHAM.  [To the QUEEN]  Whenever Buckingham
10 1359     doth turn his hate
10 1360     Upon your Grace, but with all duteous love
10 1361     Doth cherish you and yours, God punish me
10 1362     With hate in those where I expect most love!
10 1363     When I have most need to employ a friend
10 1364     And most assured that he is a friend,
10 1365     Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile,
10 1366     Be he unto me! This do I beg of God
10 1367     When I am cold in love to you or yours.
10 1368                                                   [They embrace]
10 1369   KING EDWARD. A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham,
10 1370     Is this thy vow unto my sickly heart.
10 1371     There wanteth now our brother Gloucester here
10 1372     To make the blessed period of this peace.
10 1373   BUCKINGHAM. And, in good time,
10 1374     Here comes Sir Richard Ratcliff and the Duke.
10 1375 
10 1376                       Enter GLOUCESTER, and RATCLIFF
10 1377 
10 1378   GLOUCESTER. Good morrow to my sovereign king and
10 1379     Queen;
10 1380     And, princely peers, a happy time of day!
10 1381   KING EDWARD. Happy, indeed, as we have spent the day.
10 1382     Gloucester, we have done deeds of charity,
10 1383     Made peace of enmity, fair love of hate,
10 1384     Between these swelling wrong-incensed peers.
10 1385   GLOUCESTER. A blessed labour, my most sovereign lord.
10 1386     Among this princely heap, if any here,
10 1387     By false intelligence or wrong surmise,
10 1388     Hold me a foe-
10 1389     If I unwittingly, or in my rage,
10 1390     Have aught committed that is hardly borne
10 1391     To any in this presence, I desire
10 1392     To reconcile me to his friendly peace:
10 1393     'Tis death to me to be at enmity;
10 1394     I hate it, and desire all good men's love.
10 1395     First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,
10 1396     Which I will purchase with my duteous service;
10 1397     Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham,
10 1398     If ever any grudge were lodg'd between us;
10 1399     Of you, and you, Lord Rivers, and of Dorset,
10 1400     That all without desert have frown'd on me;
10 1401     Of you, Lord Woodville, and, Lord Scales, of you;
10 1402     Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen-indeed, of all.
10 1403     I do not know that Englishman alive
10 1404     With whom my soul is any jot at odds
10 1405     More than the infant that is born to-night.
10 1406     I thank my God for my humility.
10 1407   QUEEN ELIZABETH. A holy day shall this be kept hereafter.
10 1408     I would to God all strifes were well compounded.
10 1409     My sovereign lord, I do beseech your Highness
10 1410     To take our brother Clarence to your grace.
10 1411   GLOUCESTER. Why, madam, have I off'red love for this,
10 1412     To be so flouted in this royal presence?
10 1413     Who knows not that the gentle Duke is dead?
10 1414                                                 [They all start]
10 1415     You do him injury to scorn his corse.
10 1416   KING EDWARD. Who knows not he is dead! Who knows
10 1417     he is?
10 1418   QUEEN ELIZABETH. All-seeing heaven, what a world is this!
10 1419   BUCKINGHAM. Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?
10 1420   DORSET. Ay, my good lord; and no man in the presence
10 1421     But his red colour hath forsook his cheeks.
10 1422   KING EDWARD. Is Clarence dead? The order was revers'd.
10 1423   GLOUCESTER. But he, poor man, by your first order died,
10 1424     And that a winged Mercury did bear;
10 1425     Some tardy cripple bare the countermand
10 1426     That came too lag to see him buried.
10 1427     God grant that some, less noble and less loyal,
10 1428     Nearer in bloody thoughts, an not in blood,
10 1429     Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did,
10 1430     And yet go current from suspicion!
10 1431 
10 1432                            Enter DERBY
10 1433 
10 1434   DERBY. A boon, my sovereign, for my service done!
10 1435   KING EDWARD. I prithee, peace; my soul is full of sorrow.
10 1436   DERBY. I Will not rise unless your Highness hear me.
10 1437   KING EDWARD. Then say at once what is it thou requests.
10 1438   DERBY. The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life;
10 1439     Who slew to-day a riotous gentleman
10 1440     Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk.
10 1441   KING EDWARD. Have I a tongue to doom my brother's death,
10 1442     And shall that tongue give pardon to a slave?
10 1443     My brother killed no man-his fault was thought,
10 1444     And yet his punishment was bitter death.
10 1445     Who sued to me for him? Who, in my wrath,
10 1446     Kneel'd at my feet, and bid me be advis'd?
10 1447     Who spoke of brotherhood? Who spoke of love?
10 1448     Who told me how the poor soul did forsake
10 1449     The mighty Warwick and did fight for me?
10 1450     Who told me, in the field at Tewksbury
10 1451     When Oxford had me down, he rescued me
10 1452     And said 'Dear Brother, live, and be a king'?
10 1453     Who told me, when we both lay in the field
10 1454     Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me
10 1455     Even in his garments, and did give himself,
10 1456     All thin and naked, to the numb cold night?
10 1457     All this from my remembrance brutish wrath
10 1458     Sinfully pluck'd, and not a man of you
10 1459     Had so much race to put it in my mind.
10 1460     But when your carters or your waiting-vassals
10 1461     Have done a drunken slaughter and defac'd
10 1462     The precious image of our dear Redeemer,
10 1463     You straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon;
10 1464     And I, unjustly too, must grant it you.        [DERBY rises]
10 1465     But for my brother not a man would speak;
10 1466     Nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself
10 1467     For him, poor soul. The proudest of you all
10 1468     Have been beholding to him in his life;
10 1469     Yet none of you would once beg for his life.
10 1470     O God, I fear thy justice will take hold
10 1471     On me, and you, and mine, and yours, for this!
10 1472     Come, Hastings, help me to my closet. Ah, poor Clarence!
10 1473                                  Exeunt some with KING and QUEEN
10 1474   GLOUCESTER. This is the fruits of rashness. Mark'd you not
10 1475     How that the guilty kindred of the Queen
10 1476     Look'd pale when they did hear of Clarence' death?
10 1477     O, they did urge it still unto the King!
10 1478     God will revenge it. Come, lords, will you go
10 1479     To comfort Edward with our company?
10 1480   BUCKINGHAM. We wait upon your Grace.                    Exeunt
10 1481

10 1484 
10 1485 SCENE 2.
10 1486 
10 1487 London. The palace
10 1488 
10 1489 Enter the old DUCHESS OF YORK, with the SON and DAUGHTER of
10 1490 CLARENCE
10 1491 
10 1492   SON. Good grandam, tell us, is our father dead?
10 1493   DUCHESS. No, boy.
10 1494   DAUGHTER. Why do you weep so oft, and beat your breast,
10 1495     And cry 'O Clarence, my unhappy son!'?
10 1496   SON. Why do you look on us, and shake your head,
10 1497     And call us orphans, wretches, castaways,
10 1498     If that our noble father were alive?
10 1499   DUCHESS. My pretty cousins, you mistake me both;
10 1500     I do lament the sickness of the King,
10 1501     As loath to lose him, not your father's death;
10 1502     It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost.
10 1503   SON. Then you conclude, my grandam, he is dead.
10 1504     The King mine uncle is to blame for it.
10 1505     God will revenge it; whom I will importune
10 1506     With earnest prayers all to that effect.
10 1507   DAUGHTER. And so will I.
10 1508   DUCHESS. Peace, children, peace! The King doth love you
10 1509     well.
10 1510     Incapable and shallow innocents,
10 1511     You cannot guess who caus'd your father's death.
10 1512   SON. Grandam, we can; for my good uncle Gloucester
10 1513     Told me the King, provok'd to it by the Queen,
10 1514     Devis'd impeachments to imprison him.
10 1515     And when my uncle told me so, he wept,
10 1516     And pitied me, and kindly kiss'd my cheek;
10 1517     Bade me rely on him as on my father,
10 1518     And he would love me dearly as a child.
10 1519   DUCHESS. Ah, that deceit should steal such gentle shape,
10 1520     And with a virtuous vizor hide deep vice!
10 1521     He is my son; ay, and therein my shame;
10 1522     Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit.
10 1523   SON. Think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam?
10 1524   DUCHESS. Ay, boy.
10 1525   SON. I cannot think it. Hark! what noise is this?
10 1526 
10 1527             Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH, with her hair about her
10 1528                 ears; RIVERS and DORSET after her
10 1529 
10 1530   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Ah, who shall hinder me to wail and
10 1531     weep,
10 1532     To chide my fortune, and torment myself?
10 1533     I'll join with black despair against my soul
10 1534     And to myself become an enemy.
10 1535   DUCHESS. What means this scene of rude impatience?
10 1536   QUEEN ELIZABETH. To make an act of tragic violence.
10 1537   EDWARD, my lord, thy son, our king, is dead.
10 1538     Why grow the branches when the root is gone?
10 1539     Why wither not the leaves that want their sap?
10 1540     If you will live, lament; if die, be brief,
10 1541     That our swift-winged souls may catch the King's,
10 1542     Or like obedient subjects follow him
10 1543     To his new kingdom of ne'er-changing night.
10 1544   DUCHESS. Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow
10 1545     As I had title in thy noble husband!
10 1546     I have bewept a worthy husband's death,
10 1547     And liv'd with looking on his images;
10 1548     But now two mirrors of his princely semblance
10 1549     Are crack'd in pieces by malignant death,
10 1550     And I for comfort have but one false glass,
10 1551     That grieves me when I see my shame in him.
10 1552     Thou art a widow, yet thou art a mother
10 1553     And hast the comfort of thy children left;
10 1554     But death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms
10 1555     And pluck'd two crutches from my feeble hands-
10 1556     Clarence and Edward. O, what cause have I-
10 1557     Thine being but a moiety of my moan-
10 1558     To overgo thy woes and drown thy cries?
10 1559   SON. Ah, aunt, you wept not for our father's death!
10 1560     How can we aid you with our kindred tears?
10 1561   DAUGHTER. Our fatherless distress was left unmoan'd;
10 1562     Your widow-dolour likewise be unwept!
10 1563   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Give me no help in lamentation;
10 1564     I am not barren to bring forth complaints.
10 1565     All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes
10 1566     That I, being govern'd by the watery moon,
10 1567     May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world!
10 1568     Ah for my husband, for my dear Lord Edward!
10 1569   CHILDREN. Ah for our father, for our dear Lord Clarence!
10 1570   DUCHESS. Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!
10 1571   QUEEN ELIZABETH. What stay had I but Edward? and he's
10 1572     gone.
10 1573   CHILDREN. What stay had we but Clarence? and he's gone.
10 1574   DUCHESS. What stays had I but they? and they are gone.
10 1575   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Was never widow had so dear a loss.
10 1576   CHILDREN. Were never orphans had so dear a loss.
10 1577   DUCHESS. Was never mother had so dear a loss.
10 1578     Alas, I am the mother of these griefs!
10 1579     Their woes are parcell'd, mine is general.
10 1580     She for an Edward weeps, and so do I:
10 1581     I for a Clarence weep, so doth not she.
10 1582     These babes for Clarence weep, and so do I:
10 1583     I for an Edward weep, so do not they.
10 1584     Alas, you three on me, threefold distress'd,
10 1585     Pour all your tears! I am your sorrow's nurse,
10 1586     And I will pamper it with lamentation.
10 1587   DORSET. Comfort, dear mother. God is much displeas'd
10 1588     That you take with unthankfulness his doing.
10 1589     In common worldly things 'tis called ungrateful
10 1590     With dull unwillingness to repay a debt
10 1591     Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent;
10 1592     Much more to be thus opposite with heaven,
10 1593     For it requires the royal debt it lent you.
10 1594   RIVERS. Madam, bethink you, like a careful mother,
10 1595     Of the young prince your son. Send straight for him;
10 1596     Let him be crown'd; in him your comfort lives.
10 1597     Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward's grave,
10 1598     And plant your joys in living Edward's throne.
10 1599 
10 1600                Enter GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM, DERBY,
10 1601                       HASTINGS, and RATCLIFF
10 1602 
10 1603   GLOUCESTER. Sister, have comfort. All of us have cause
10 1604     To wail the dimming of our shining star;
10 1605     But none can help our harms by wailing them.
10 1606     Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy;
10 1607     I did not see your Grace. Humbly on my knee
10 1608     I crave your blessing.
10 1609   DUCHESS. God bless thee; and put meekness in thy breast,
10 1610     Love, charity, obedience, and true duty!
10 1611   GLOUCESTER. Amen!  [Aside]  And make me die a good old
10 1612     man!
10 1613     That is the butt end of a mother's blessing;
10 1614     I marvel that her Grace did leave it out.
10 1615   BUCKINGHAM. You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing
10 1616     peers,
10 1617     That bear this heavy mutual load of moan,
10 1618     Now cheer each other in each other's love.
10 1619     Though we have spent our harvest of this king,
10 1620     We are to reap the harvest of his son.
10 1621     The broken rancour of your high-swol'n hearts,
10 1622     But lately splinter'd, knit, and join'd together,
10 1623     Must gently be preserv'd, cherish'd, and kept.
10 1624     Me seemeth good that, with some little train,
10 1625     Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fet
10 1626     Hither to London, to be crown'd our King.
10 1627 
10 1628  RIVERS. Why with some little train, my Lord of
10 1629     Buckingham?
10 1630   BUCKINGHAM. Marry, my lord, lest by a multitude
10 1631     The new-heal'd wound of malice should break out,
10 1632     Which would be so much the more dangerous
10 1633     By how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd;
10 1634     Where every horse bears his commanding rein
10 1635     And may direct his course as please himself,
10 1636     As well the fear of harm as harm apparent,
10 1637     In my opinion, ought to be prevented.
10 1638   GLOUCESTER. I hope the King made peace with all of us;
10 1639     And the compact is firm and true in me.
10 1640   RIVERS. And so in me; and so, I think, in an.
10 1641     Yet, since it is but green, it should be put
10 1642     To no apparent likelihood of breach,
10 1643     Which haply by much company might be urg'd;
10 1644     Therefore I say with noble Buckingham
10 1645     That it is meet so few should fetch the Prince.
10 1646   HASTINGS. And so say I.
10 1647   GLOUCESTER. Then be it so; and go we to determine
10 1648     Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow.
10 1649     Madam, and you, my sister, will you go
10 1650     To give your censures in this business?
10 1651                         Exeunt all but BUCKINGHAM and GLOUCESTER
10 1652   BUCKINGHAM. My lord, whoever journeys to the Prince,
10 1653     For God sake, let not us two stay at home;
10 1654     For by the way I'll sort occasion,
10 1655     As index to the story we late talk'd of,
10 1656     To part the Queen's proud kindred from the Prince.
10 1657   GLOUCESTER. My other self, my counsel's consistory,
10 1658     My oracle, my prophet, my dear cousin,
10 1659     I, as a child, will go by thy direction.
10 1660     Toward Ludlow then, for we'll not stay behind.        Exeunt
10 1661 
10 1662 
10 1663 
10 1664 
10 1665 SCENE 3.
10 1666 
10 1667 London. A street
10 1668 
10 1669 Enter one CITIZEN at one door, and another at the other
10 1670 
10 1671   FIRST CITIZEN. Good morrow, neighbour. Whither away so
10 1672     fast?
10 1673   SECOND CITIZEN. I promise you, I scarcely know myself.
10 1674     Hear you the news abroad?
10 1675   FIRST CITIZEN. Yes, that the King is dead.
10 1676   SECOND CITIZEN. Ill news, by'r lady; seldom comes the
10 1677     better.
10 1678     I fear, I fear 'twill prove a giddy world.
10 1679 
10 1680                         Enter another CITIZEN
10 1681 
10 1682   THIRD CITIZEN. Neighbours, God speed!
10 1683   FIRST CITIZEN. Give you good morrow, sir.
10 1684   THIRD CITIZEN. Doth the news hold of good King Edward's
10 1685     death?
10 1686   SECOND CITIZEN. Ay, sir, it is too true; God help the while!
10 1687   THIRD CITIZEN. Then, masters, look to see a troublous
10 1688     world.
10 1689   FIRST CITIZEN. No, no; by God's good grace, his son shall
10 1690     reign.
10 1691   THIRD CITIZEN. Woe to that land that's govern'd by a child.
10 1692   SECOND CITIZEN. In him there is a hope of government,
10 1693     Which, in his nonage, council under him,
10 1694     And, in his full and ripened years, himself,
10 1695     No doubt, shall then, and till then, govern well.
10 1696   FIRST CITIZEN. So stood the state when Henry the Sixth
10 1697     Was crown'd in Paris but at nine months old.
10 1698   THIRD CITIZEN. Stood the state so? No, no, good friends,
10 1699     God wot;
10 1700     For then this land was famously enrich'd
10 1701     With politic grave counsel; then the King
10 1702     Had virtuous uncles to protect his Grace.
10 1703   FIRST CITIZEN. Why, so hath this, both by his father and
10 1704     mother.
10 1705   THIRD CITIZEN. Better it were they all came by his father,
10 1706     Or by his father there were none at all;
10 1707     For emulation who shall now be nearest
10 1708     Will touch us all too near, if God prevent not.
10 1709     O, full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester!
10 1710     And the Queen's sons and brothers haught and proud;
10 1711     And were they to be rul'd, and not to rule,
10 1712     This sickly land might solace as before.
10 1713   FIRST CITIZEN. Come, come, we fear the worst; all will be
10 1714     well.
10 1715   THIRD CITIZEN. When clouds are seen, wise men put on
10 1716     their cloaks;
10 1717     When great leaves fall, then winter is at hand;
10 1718     When the sun sets, who doth not look for night?
10 1719     Untimely storms make men expect a dearth.
10 1720     All may be well; but, if God sort it so,
10 1721     'Tis more than we deserve or I expect.
10 1722   SECOND CITIZEN. Truly, the hearts of men are fun of fear.
10 1723     You cannot reason almost with a man
10 1724     That looks not heavily and fun of dread.
10 1725   THIRD CITIZEN. Before the days of change, still is it so;
10 1726     By a divine instinct men's minds mistrust
10 1727     Ensuing danger; as by proof we see
10 1728     The water swell before a boist'rous storm.
10 1729     But leave it all to God. Whither away?
10 1730   SECOND CITIZEN. Marry, we were sent for to the justices.
10 1731   THIRD CITIZEN. And so was I; I'll bear you company.
10 1732                                                           Exeunt

10 1737 SCENE 4.
10 1738 
10 1739 London. The palace
10 1740 
10 1741 Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, the young DUKE OF YORK, QUEEN
10 1742 ELIZABETH,
10 1743 and the DUCHESS OF YORK
10 1744 
10 1745   ARCHBISHOP. Last night, I hear, they lay at Stony Stratford,
10 1746     And at Northampton they do rest to-night;
10 1747     To-morrow or next day they will be here.
10 1748   DUCHESS. I long with all my heart to see the Prince.
10 1749     I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.
10 1750   QUEEN ELIZABETH. But I hear no; they say my son of York
10 1751     Has almost overta'en him in his growth.
10 1752   YORK. Ay, mother; but I would not have it so.
10 1753   DUCHESS. Why, my good cousin, it is good to grow.
10 1754   YORK. Grandam, one night as we did sit at supper,
10 1755     My uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow
10 1756     More than my brother. 'Ay,' quoth my uncle Gloucester
10 1757     'Small herbs have grace: great weeds do grow apace.'
10 1758     And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast,
10 1759     Because sweet flow'rs are slow and weeds make haste.
10 1760   DUCHESS. Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold
10 1761     In him that did object the same to thee.
10 1762     He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,
10 1763     So long a-growing and so leisurely
10 1764     That, if his rule were true, he should be gracious.
10 1765   ARCHBISHOP. And so no doubt he is, my gracious madam.
10 1766   DUCHESS. I hope he is; but yet let mothers doubt.
10 1767   YORK. Now, by my troth, if I had been rememb'red,
10 1768     I could have given my uncle's Grace a flout
10 1769     To touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine.
10 1770   DUCHESS. How, my young York? I prithee let me hear it.
10 1771   YORK. Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast
10 1772     That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old.
10 1773     'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.
10 1774     Grandam, this would have been a biting jest.
10 1775   DUCHESS. I prithee, pretty York, who told thee this?
10 1776   YORK. Grandam, his nurse.
10 1777   DUCHESS. His nurse! Why she was dead ere thou wast
10 1778     born.
10 1779   YORK. If 'twere not she, I cannot tell who told me.
10 1780   QUEEN ELIZABETH. A parlous boy! Go to, you are too
10 1781     shrewd.
10 1782   ARCHBISHOP. Good madam, be not angry with the child.
10 1783   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Pitchers have ears.
10 1784 
10 1785                         Enter a MESSENGER
10 1786 
10 1787   ARCHBISHOP. Here comes a messenger. What news?
10 1788   MESSENGER. Such news, my lord, as grieves me to report.
10 1789   QUEEN ELIZABETH. How doth the Prince?
10 1790   MESSENGER. Well, madam, and in health.
10 1791   DUCHESS. What is thy news?
10 1792   MESSENGER. Lord Rivers and Lord Grey
10 1793     Are sent to Pomfret, and with them
10 1794     Sir Thomas Vaughan, prisoners.
10 1795   DUCHESS. Who hath committed them?
10 1796   MESSENGER. The mighty Dukes, Gloucester and Buckingham.
10 1797   ARCHBISHOP. For what offence?
10 1798   MESSENGER. The sum of all I can, I have disclos'd.
10 1799     Why or for what the nobles were committed
10 1800     Is all unknown to me, my gracious lord.
10 1801   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Ay me, I see the ruin of my house!
10 1802     The tiger now hath seiz'd the gentle hind;
10 1803     Insulting tyranny begins to jet
10 1804     Upon the innocent and aweless throne.
10 1805     Welcome, destruction, blood, and massacre!
10 1806     I see, as in a map, the end of all.
10 1807   DUCHESS. Accursed and unquiet wrangling days,
10 1808     How many of you have mine eyes beheld!
10 1809     My husband lost his life to get the crown;
10 1810     And often up and down my sons were toss'd
10 1811     For me to joy and weep their gain and loss;
10 1812     And being seated, and domestic broils
10 1813     Clean over-blown, themselves the conquerors
10 1814     Make war upon themselves-brother to brother,
10 1815     Blood to blood, self against self. O, preposterous
10 1816     And frantic outrage, end thy damned spleen,
10 1817     Or let me die, to look on death no more!
10 1818   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Come, come, my boy; we will to
10 1819     sanctuary.
10 1820     Madam, farewell.
10 1821   DUCHESS. Stay, I will go with you.
10 1822   QUEEN ELIZABETH. You have no cause.
10 1823   ARCHBISHOP.  [To the QUEEN]  My gracious lady, go.
10 1824     And thither bear your treasure and your goods.
10 1825     For my part, I'll resign unto your Grace
10 1826     The seal I keep; and so betide to me
10 1827     As well I tender you and all of yours!
10 1828     Go, I'll conduct you to the sanctuary.                Exeunt

10 1844 ACT III. SCENE 1.
10 1845 
10 1846 London. A street
10 1847 
10 1848 The trumpets sound. Enter the PRINCE OF WALES, GLOUCESTER,
10 1849 BUCKINGHAM,
10 1850 CATESBY, CARDINAL BOURCHIER, and others
10 1851 
10 1852   BUCKINGHAM. Welcome, sweet Prince, to London, to your
10 1853     chamber.
10 1854   GLOUCESTER. Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign.
10 1855     The weary way hath made you melancholy.
10 1856   PRINCE. No, uncle; but our crosses on the way
10 1857     Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy.
10 1858     I want more uncles here to welcome me.
10 1859   GLOUCESTER. Sweet Prince, the untainted virtue of your
10 1860     years
10 1861     Hath not yet div'd into the world's deceit;
10 1862     Nor more can you distinguish of a man
10 1863     Than of his outward show; which, God He knows,
10 1864     Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.
10 1865     Those uncles which you want were dangerous;
10 1866     Your Grace attended to their sug'red words
10 1867     But look'd not on the poison of their hearts.
10 1868     God keep you from them and from such false friends!
10 1869   PRINCE. God keep me from false friends! but they were
10 1870     none.
10 1871   GLOUCESTER. My lord, the Mayor of London comes to greet
10 1872     you.
10 1873 
10 1874                 Enter the LORD MAYOR and his train
10 1875 
10 1876   MAYOR. God bless your Grace with health and happy days!
10 1877   PRINCE. I thank you, good my lord, and thank you all.
10 1878     I thought my mother and my brother York
10 1879     Would long ere this have met us on the way.
10 1880     Fie, what a slug is Hastings, that he comes not
10 1881     To tell us whether they will come or no!
10 1882 
10 1883                         Enter LORD HASTINGS
10 1884 
10 1885   BUCKINGHAM. And, in good time, here comes the sweating
10 1886     Lord.
10 1887   PRINCE. Welcome, my lord. What, will our mother come?
10 1888   HASTINGS. On what occasion, God He knows, not I,
10 1889     The Queen your mother and your brother York
10 1890     Have taken sanctuary. The tender Prince
10 1891     Would fain have come with me to meet your Grace,
10 1892     But by his mother was perforce withheld.
10 1893   BUCKINGHAM. Fie, what an indirect and peevish course
10 1894     Is this of hers? Lord Cardinal, will your Grace
10 1895     Persuade the Queen to send the Duke of York
10 1896     Unto his princely brother presently?
10 1897     If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him
10 1898     And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.
10 1899   CARDINAL. My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory
10 1900     Can from his mother win the Duke of York,
10 1901     Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate
10 1902     To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid
10 1903     We should infringe the holy privilege
10 1904     Of blessed sanctuary! Not for all this land
10 1905     Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.
10 1906   BUCKINGHAM. You are too senseless-obstinate, my lord,
10 1907     Too ceremonious and traditional.
10 1908     Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,
10 1909     You break not sanctuary in seizing him.
10 1910     The benefit thereof is always granted
10 1911     To those whose dealings have deserv'd the place
10 1912     And those who have the wit to claim the place.
10 1913     This Prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserv'd it,
10 1914     And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it.
10 1915     Then, taking him from thence that is not there,
10 1916     You break no privilege nor charter there.
10 1917     Oft have I heard of sanctuary men;
10 1918     But sanctuary children never till now.
10 1919   CARDINAL. My lord, you shall o'errule my mind for once.
10 1920     Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?
10 1921   HASTINGS. I go, my lord.
10 1922   PRINCE. Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.
10 1923                                     Exeunt CARDINAL and HASTINGS
10 1924     Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come,
10 1925     Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?
10 1926   GLOUCESTER. Where it seems best unto your royal self.
10 1927     If I may counsel you, some day or two
10 1928     Your Highness shall repose you at the Tower,
10 1929     Then where you please and shall be thought most fit
10 1930     For your best health and recreation.
10 1931   PRINCE. I do not like the Tower, of any place.
10 1932     Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?
10 1933   BUCKINGHAM. He did, my gracious lord, begin that place,
10 1934     Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.
10 1935   PRINCE. Is it upon record, or else reported
10 1936     Successively from age to age, he built it?
10 1937   BUCKINGHAM. Upon record, my gracious lord.
10 1938   PRINCE. But say, my lord, it were not regist'red,
10 1939     Methinks the truth should Eve from age to age,
10 1940     As 'twere retail'd to all posterity,
10 1941     Even to the general all-ending day.
10 1942   GLOUCESTER.  [Aside]  So wise so young, they say, do never
10 1943     live long.
10 1944   PRINCE. What say you, uncle?
10 1945   GLOUCESTER. I say, without characters, fame lives long.
10 1946     [Aside]  Thus, like the formal vice, Iniquity,
10 1947     I moralize two meanings in one word.
10 1948   PRINCE. That Julius Caesar was a famous man;
10 1949     With what his valour did enrich his wit,
10 1950     His wit set down to make his valour live.
10 1951     Death makes no conquest of this conqueror;
10 1952     For now he lives in fame, though not in life.
10 1953     I'll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham-
10 1954   BUCKINGHAM. What, my gracious lord?
10 1955   PRINCE. An if I live until I be a man,
10 1956     I'll win our ancient right in France again,
10 1957     Or die a soldier as I liv'd a king.
10 1958   GLOUCESTER.  [Aside]  Short summers lightly have a forward
10 1959     spring.
10 1960 
10 1961               Enter HASTINGS, young YORK, and the CARDINAL
10 1962 
10 1963   BUCKINGHAM. Now, in good time, here comes the Duke of
10 1964     York.
10 1965   PRINCE. Richard of York, how fares our loving brother?
10 1966   YORK. Well, my dread lord; so must I can you now.
10 1967   PRINCE. Ay brother, to our grief, as it is yours.
10 1968     Too late he died that might have kept that title,
10 1969     Which by his death hath lost much majesty.
10 1970   GLOUCESTER. How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?
10 1971   YORK. I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord,
10 1972     You said that idle weeds are fast in growth.
10 1973     The Prince my brother hath outgrown me far.
10 1974   GLOUCESTER. He hath, my lord.
10 1975   YORK. And therefore is he idle?
10 1976   GLOUCESTER. O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.
10 1977   YORK. Then he is more beholding to you than I.
10 1978   GLOUCESTER. He may command me as my sovereign;
10 1979     But you have power in me as in a kinsman.
10 1980   YORK. I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.
10 1981   GLOUCESTER. My dagger, little cousin? With all my heart!
10 1982   PRINCE. A beggar, brother?
10 1983   YORK. Of my kind uncle, that I know will give,
10 1984     And being but a toy, which is no grief to give.
10 1985   GLOUCESTER. A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin.
10 1986   YORK. A greater gift! O, that's the sword to it!
10 1987   GLOUCESTER. Ay, gentle cousin, were it light enough.
10 1988   YORK. O, then, I see you will part but with light gifts:
10 1989     In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay.
10 1990   GLOUCESTER. It is too heavy for your Grace to wear.
10 1991   YORK. I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.
10 1992   GLOUCESTER. What, would you have my weapon, little
10 1993     Lord?
10 1994   YORK. I would, that I might thank you as you call me.
10 1995   GLOUCESTER. How?
10 1996   YORK. Little.
10 1997   PRINCE. My Lord of York will still be cross in talk.
10 1998     Uncle, your Grace knows how to bear with him.
10 1999   YORK. You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me.
10 2000     Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me;
10 2001     Because that I am little, like an ape,
10 2002     He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.
10 2003   BUCKINGHAM. With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!
10 2004     To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle
10 2005     He prettily and aptly taunts himself.
10 2006     So cunning and so young is wonderful.
10 2007   GLOUCESTER. My lord, will't please you pass along?
10 2008     Myself and my good cousin Buckingham
10 2009     Will to your mother, to entreat of her
10 2010     To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.
10 2011   YORK. What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?
10 2012   PRINCE. My Lord Protector needs will have it so.
10 2013   YORK. I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.
10 2014   GLOUCESTER. Why, what should you fear?
10 2015   YORK. Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost.
10 2016     My grandam told me he was murder'd there.
10 2017   PRINCE. I fear no uncles dead.
10 2018   GLOUCESTER. Nor none that live, I hope.
10 2019   PRINCE. An if they live, I hope I need not fear.
10 2020     But come, my lord; and with a heavy heart,
10 2021     Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower.
10 2022     A sennet.
10 2023               Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM, and CATESBY
10 2024   BUCKINGHAM. Think you, my lord, this little prating York
10 2025     Was not incensed by his subtle mother
10 2026     To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?
10 2027   GLOUCESTER. No doubt, no doubt. O, 'tis a perilous boy;
10 2028     Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable.
10 2029     He is all the mother's, from the top to toe.
10 2030   BUCKINGHAM. Well, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby.
10 2031     Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend
10 2032     As closely to conceal what we impart.
10 2033     Thou know'st our reasons urg'd upon the way.
10 2034     What think'st thou? Is it not an easy matter
10 2035     To make William Lord Hastings of our mind,
10 2036     For the instalment of this noble Duke
10 2037     In the seat royal of this famous isle?
10 2038   CATESBY. He for his father's sake so loves the Prince
10 2039     That he will not be won to aught against him.
10 2040   BUCKINGHAM. What think'st thou then of Stanley? Will
10 2041     not he?
10 2042   CATESBY. He will do all in all as Hastings doth.
10 2043   BUCKINGHAM. Well then, no more but this: go, gentle
10 2044     Catesby,
10 2045     And, as it were far off, sound thou Lord Hastings
10 2046     How he doth stand affected to our purpose;
10 2047     And summon him to-morrow to the Tower,
10 2048     To sit about the coronation.
10 2049     If thou dost find him tractable to us,
10 2050     Encourage him, and tell him all our reasons;
10 2051     If he be leaden, icy, cold, unwilling,
10 2052     Be thou so too, and so break off the talk,
10 2053     And give us notice of his inclination;
10 2054     For we to-morrow hold divided councils,
10 2055     Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd.
10 2056   GLOUCESTER. Commend me to Lord William. Tell him,
10 2057     Catesby,
10 2058     His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries
10 2059     To-morrow are let blood at Pomfret Castle;
10 2060     And bid my lord, for joy of this good news,
10 2061     Give Mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more.
10 2062   BUCKINGHAM. Good Catesby, go effect this business soundly.
10 2063   CATESBY. My good lords both, with all the heed I can.
10 2064   GLOUCESTER. Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?
10 2065   CATESBY. You shall, my lord.
10 2066   GLOUCESTER. At Crosby House, there shall you find us both.
10 2067                                                     Exit CATESBY
10 2068   BUCKINGHAM. Now, my lord, what shall we do if we
10 2069     perceive
10 2070     Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?
10 2071   GLOUCESTER. Chop off his head-something we will
10 2072     determine.
10 2073     And, look when I am King, claim thou of me
10 2074     The earldom of Hereford and all the movables
10 2075     Whereof the King my brother was possess'd.
10 2076   BUCKINGHAM. I'll claim that promise at your Grace's hand.
10 2077   GLOUCESTER. And look to have it yielded with all kindness.
10 2078     Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards
10 2079     We may digest our complots in some form.              Exeunt
10 2080 
10 2081 
10 2082 
10 2083 
10 2084 SCENE 2.
10 2085 
10 2086 Before LORD HASTING'S house
10 2087 
10 2088 Enter a MESSENGER to the door of HASTINGS
10 2089 
10 2090   MESSENGER. My lord, my lord!                        [Knocking]
10 2091   HASTINGS.  [Within]  Who knocks?
10 2092   MESSENGER. One from the Lord Stanley.
10 2093   HASTINGS.  [Within]  What is't o'clock?
10 2094   MESSENGER. Upon the stroke of four.
10 2095 
10 2096                         Enter LORD HASTINGS
10 2097 
10 2098   HASTINGS. Cannot my Lord Stanley sleep these tedious
10 2099     nights?
10 2100   MESSENGER. So it appears by that I have to say.
10 2101     First, he commends him to your noble self.
10 2102   HASTINGS. What then?
10 2103   MESSENGER. Then certifies your lordship that this night
10 2104     He dreamt the boar had razed off his helm.
10 2105     Besides, he says there are two councils kept,
10 2106     And that may be determin'd at the one
10 2107     Which may make you and him to rue at th' other.
10 2108     Therefore he sends to know your lordship's pleasure-
10 2109     If you will presently take horse with him
10 2110     And with all speed post with him toward the north
10 2111     To shun the danger that his soul divines.
10 2112   HASTINGS. Go, fellow, go, return unto thy lord;
10 2113     Bid him not fear the separated council:
10 2114     His honour and myself are at the one,
10 2115     And at the other is my good friend Catesby;
10 2116     Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us
10 2117     Whereof I shall not have intelligence.
10 2118     Tell him his fears are shallow, without instance;
10 2119     And for his dreams, I wonder he's so simple
10 2120     To trust the mock'ry of unquiet slumbers.
10 2121     To fly the boar before the boar pursues
10 2122     Were to incense the boar to follow us
10 2123     And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.
10 2124     Go, bid thy master rise and come to me;
10 2125     And we will both together to the Tower,
10 2126     Where, he shall see, the boar will use us kindly.
10 2127   MESSENGER. I'll go, my lord, and tell him what you say.
10 2128  Exit
10 2129 
10 2130                          Enter CATESBY
10 2131 
10 2132   CATESBY. Many good morrows to my noble lord!
10 2133   HASTINGS. Good morrow, Catesby; you are early stirring.
10 2134     What news, what news, in this our tott'ring state?
10 2135   CATESBY. It is a reeling world indeed, my lord;
10 2136     And I believe will never stand upright
10 2137     Till Richard wear the garland of the realm.
10 2138   HASTINGS. How, wear the garland! Dost thou mean the
10 2139     crown?
10 2140   CATESBY. Ay, my good lord.
10 2141   HASTINGS. I'll have this crown of mine cut from my
10 2142     shoulders
10 2143     Before I'll see the crown so foul misplac'd.
10 2144     But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?
10 2145   CATESBY. Ay, on my life; and hopes to find you forward
10 2146     Upon his party for the gain thereof;
10 2147     And thereupon he sends you this good news,
10 2148     That this same very day your enemies,
10 2149     The kindred of the Queen, must die at Pomfret.
10 2150   HASTINGS. Indeed, I am no mourner for that news,
10 2151     Because they have been still my adversaries;
10 2152     But that I'll give my voice on Richard's side
10 2153     To bar my master's heirs in true descent,
10 2154     God knows I will not do it to the death.
10 2155   CATESBY. God keep your lordship in that gracious mind!
10 2156   HASTINGS. But I shall laugh at this a twelve month hence,
10 2157     That they which brought me in my master's hate,
10 2158     I live to look upon their tragedy.
10 2159     Well, Catesby, ere a fortnight make me older,
10 2160     I'll send some packing that yet think not on't.
10 2161   CATESBY. 'Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,
10 2162     When men are unprepar'd and look not for it.
10 2163   HASTINGS. O monstrous, monstrous! And so falls it out
10 2164     With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey; and so 'twill do
10 2165     With some men else that think themselves as safe
10 2166     As thou and I, who, as thou knowest, are dear
10 2167     To princely Richard and to Buckingham.
10 2168   CATESBY. The Princes both make high account of you-
10 2169     [Aside]  For they account his head upon the bridge.
10 2170   HASTINGS. I know they do, and I have well deserv'd it.
10 2171 
10 2172                       Enter LORD STANLEY
10 2173 
10 2174     Come on, come on; where is your boar-spear, man?
10 2175     Fear you the boar, and go so unprovided?
10 2176   STANLEY. My lord, good morrow; good morrow, Catesby.
10 2177     You may jest on, but, by the holy rood,
10 2178     I do not like these several councils, I.
10 2179   HASTINGS. My lord, I hold my life as dear as yours,
10 2180     And never in my days, I do protest,
10 2181     Was it so precious to me as 'tis now.
10 2182     Think you, but that I know our state secure,
10 2183     I would be so triumphant as I am?
10 2184   STANLEY. The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from
10 2185     London,
10 2186     Were jocund and suppos'd their states were sure,
10 2187     And they indeed had no cause to mistrust;
10 2188     But yet you see how soon the day o'ercast.
10 2189     This sudden stab of rancour I misdoubt;
10 2190     Pray God, I say, I prove a needless coward.
10 2191     What, shall we toward the Tower? The day is spent.
10 2192   HASTINGS. Come, come, have with you. Wot you what, my
10 2193     Lord?
10 2194     To-day the lords you talk'd of are beheaded.
10 2195   STANLEY. They, for their truth, might better wear their
10 2196     heads
10 2197     Than some that have accus'd them wear their hats.
10 2198     But come, my lord, let's away.
10 2199 
10 2200                  Enter HASTINGS, a pursuivant
10 2201 
10 2202   HASTINGS. Go on before; I'll talk with this good fellow.
10 2203                                       Exeunt STANLEY and CATESBY
10 2204     How now, Hastings! How goes the world with thee?
10 2205   PURSUIVANT. The better that your lordship please to ask.
10 2206   HASTINGS. I tell thee, man, 'tis better with me now
10 2207     Than when thou met'st me last where now we meet:
10 2208     Then was I going prisoner to the Tower
10 2209     By the suggestion of the Queen's allies;
10 2210     But now, I tell thee-keep it to thyself-
10 2211     This day those enernies are put to death,
10 2212     And I in better state than e'er I was.
10 2213   PURSUIVANT. God hold it, to your honour's good content!
10 2214   HASTINGS. Gramercy, Hastings; there, drink that for me.
10 2215                                           [Throws him his purse]
10 2216   PURSUIVANT. I thank your honour.                          Exit
10 2217 
10 2218                             Enter a PRIEST
10 2219 
10 2220   PRIEST. Well met, my lord; I am glad to see your honour.
10 2221   HASTINGS. I thank thee, good Sir John, with all my heart.
10 2222     I am in your debt for your last exercise;
10 2223     Come the next Sabbath, and I will content you.
10 2224                                         [He whispers in his ear]
10 2225   PRIEST. I'll wait upon your lordship.
10 2226 
10 2227                             Enter BUCKINGHAM
10 2228 
10 2229   BUCKINGHAM. What, talking with a priest, Lord
10 2230     Chamberlain!
10 2231     Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest:
10 2232     Your honour hath no shriving work in hand.
10 2233   HASTINGS. Good faith, and when I met this holy man,
10 2234     The men you talk of came into my mind.
10 2235     What, go you toward the Tower?
10 2236   BUCKINGHAM. I do, my lord, but long I cannot stay there;
10 2237     I shall return before your lordship thence.
10 2238   HASTINGS. Nay, like enough, for I stay dinner there.
10 2239   BUCKINGHAM.  [Aside]  And supper too, although thou
10 2240     knowest it not.-
10 2241     Come, will you go?
10 2242   HASTINGS. I'll wait upon your lordship.                 Exeunt
10 2243 
10 2244 
10 2245 
10 2246 
10 2247 SCENE 3.
10 2248 
10 2249 Pomfret Castle
10 2250 
10 2251 Enter SIR RICHARD RATCLIFF, with halberds, carrying the Nobles,
10 2252 RIVERS, GREY, and VAUGHAN, to death
10 2253 
10 2254   RIVERS. Sir Richard Ratcliff, let me tell thee this:
10 2255     To-day shalt thou behold a subject die
10 2256     For truth, for duty, and for loyalty.
10 2257   GREY. God bless the Prince from all the pack of you!
10 2258     A knot you are of damned blood-suckers.
10 2259   VAUGHAN. You live that shall cry woe for this hereafter.
10 2260   RATCLIFF. Dispatch; the limit of your lives is out.
10 2261   RIVERS. O Pomfret, Pomfret! O thou bloody prison,
10 2262     Fatal and ominous to noble peers!
10 2263     Within the guilty closure of thy walls
10 2264   RICHARD the Second here was hack'd to death;
10 2265     And for more slander to thy dismal seat,
10 2266     We give to thee our guiltless blood to drink.
10 2267   GREY. Now Margaret's curse is fall'n upon our heads,
10 2268     When she exclaim'd on Hastings, you, and I,
10 2269     For standing by when Richard stabb'd her son.
10 2270   RIVERS. Then curs'd she Richard, then curs'd she
10 2271     Buckingham,
10 2272     Then curs'd she Hastings. O, remember, God,
10 2273     To hear her prayer for them, as now for us!
10 2274     And for my sister, and her princely sons,
10 2275     Be satisfied, dear God, with our true blood,
10 2276     Which, as thou know'st, unjustly must be spilt.
10 2277   RATCLIFF. Make haste; the hour of death is expiate.
10 2278   RIVERS. Come, Grey; come, Vaughan; let us here embrace.
10 2279     Farewell, until we meet again in heaven.              Exeunt
10 2280 
10 2281 
10 2282 
10 2283 
10 2284 SCENE 4
10 2285 
10 2286 London. The Tower
10 2287 
10 2288 Enter BUCKINGHAM, DERBY, HASTINGS, the BISHOP of ELY, RATCLIFF,
10 2289 LOVEL,
10 2290 with others and seat themselves at a table
10 2291 
10 2292   HASTINGS. Now, noble peers, the cause why we are met
10 2293     Is to determine of the coronation.
10 2294     In God's name speak-when is the royal day?
10 2295   BUCKINGHAM. Is all things ready for the royal time?
10 2296   DERBY. It is, and wants but nomination.
10 2297   BISHOP OF ELY. To-morrow then I judge a happy day.
10 2298   BUCKINGHAM. Who knows the Lord Protector's mind
10 2299     herein?
10 2300     Who is most inward with the noble Duke?
10 2301   BISHOP OF ELY. Your Grace, we think, should soonest know
10 2302     his mind.
10 2303   BUCKINGHAM. We know each other's faces; for our hearts,
10 2304     He knows no more of mine than I of yours;
10 2305     Or I of his, my lord, than you of mine.
10 2306     Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love.
10 2307   HASTINGS. I thank his Grace, I know he loves me well;
10 2308     But for his purpose in the coronation
10 2309     I have not sounded him, nor he deliver'd
10 2310     His gracious pleasure any way therein.
10 2311     But you, my honourable lords, may name the time;
10 2312     And in the Duke's behalf I'll give my voice,
10 2313     Which, I presume, he'll take in gentle part.
10 2314 
10 2315                        Enter GLOUCESTER
10 2316 
10 2317   BISHOP OF ELY. In happy time, here comes the Duke himself.
10 2318   GLOUCESTER. My noble lords and cousins an, good morrow.
10 2319     I have been long a sleeper, but I trust
10 2320     My absence doth neglect no great design
10 2321     Which by my presence might have been concluded.
10 2322   BUCKINGHAM. Had you not come upon your cue, my lord,
10 2323   WILLIAM Lord Hastings had pronounc'd your part-
10 2324     I mean, your voice for crowning of the King.
10 2325   GLOUCESTER. Than my Lord Hastings no man might be
10 2326     bolder;
10 2327     His lordship knows me well and loves me well.
10 2328     My lord of Ely, when I was last in Holborn
10 2329     I saw good strawberries in your garden there.
10 2330     I do beseech you send for some of them.
10 2331   BISHOP of ELY. Marry and will, my lord, with all my heart.
10 2332  Exit
10 2333   GLOUCESTER. Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you.
10 2334                                                [Takes him aside]
10 2335     Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business,
10 2336     And finds the testy gentleman so hot
10 2337     That he will lose his head ere give consent
10 2338     His master's child, as worshipfully he terms it,
10 2339     Shall lose the royalty of England's throne.
10 2340   BUCKINGHAM. Withdraw yourself awhile; I'll go with you.
10 2341                                 Exeunt GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM
10 2342   DERBY. We have not yet set down this day of triumph.
10 2343     To-morrow, in my judgment, is too sudden;
10 2344     For I myself am not so well provided
10 2345     As else I would be, were the day prolong'd.
10 2346 
10 2347                     Re-enter the BISHOP OF ELY
10 2348 
10 2349   BISHOP OF ELY. Where is my lord the Duke of Gloucester?
10 2350     I have sent for these strawberries.
10 2351   HASTINGS. His Grace looks cheerfully and smooth this
10 2352     morning;
10 2353     There's some conceit or other likes him well
10 2354     When that he bids good morrow with such spirit.
10 2355     I think there's never a man in Christendom
10 2356     Can lesser hide his love or hate than he;
10 2357     For by his face straight shall you know his heart.
10 2358   DERBY. What of his heart perceive you in his face
10 2359     By any livelihood he show'd to-day?
10 2360   HASTINGS. Marry, that with no man here he is offended;
10 2361     For, were he, he had shown it in his looks.
10 2362 
10 2363                Re-enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM
10 2364 
10 2365   GLOUCESTER. I pray you all, tell me what they deserve
10 2366     That do conspire my death with devilish plots
10 2367     Of damned witchcraft, and that have prevail'd
10 2368     Upon my body with their hellish charms?
10 2369   HASTINGS. The tender love I bear your Grace, my lord,
10 2370     Makes me most forward in this princely presence
10 2371     To doom th' offenders, whosoe'er they be.
10 2372     I say, my lord, they have deserved death.
10 2373   GLOUCESTER. Then be your eyes the witness of their evil.
10 2374     Look how I am bewitch'd; behold, mine arm
10 2375     Is like a blasted sapling wither'd up.
10 2376     And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch,
10 2377     Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore,
10 2378     That by their witchcraft thus have marked me.
10 2379   HASTINGS. If they have done this deed, my noble lord-
10 2380   GLOUCESTER. If?-thou protector of this damned strumpet,
10 2381     Talk'st thou to me of ifs? Thou art a traitor.
10 2382     Off with his head! Now by Saint Paul I swear
10 2383     I will not dine until I see the same.
10 2384     Lovel and Ratcliff, look that it be done.
10 2385     The rest that love me, rise and follow me.
10 2386                     Exeunt all but HASTINGS, LOVEL, and RATCLIFF
10 2387   HASTINGS. Woe, woe, for England! not a whit for me;
10 2388     For I, too fond, might have prevented this.
10 2389   STANLEY did dream the boar did raze our helms,
10 2390     And I did scorn it and disdain to fly.
10 2391     Three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumble,
10 2392     And started when he look'd upon the Tower,
10 2393     As loath to bear me to the slaughter-house.
10 2394     O, now I need the priest that spake to me!
10 2395     I now repent I told the pursuivant,
10 2396     As too triumphing, how mine enemies
10 2397     To-day at Pomfret bloodily were butcher'd,
10 2398     And I myself secure in grace and favour.
10 2399     O Margaret, Margaret, now thy heavy curse
10 2400     Is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched head!
10 2401   RATCLIFF. Come, come, dispatch; the Duke would be at
10 2402     dinner.
10 2403     Make a short shrift; he longs to see your head.
10 2404   HASTINGS. O momentary grace of mortal men,
10 2405     Which we more hunt for than the grace of God!
10 2406     Who builds his hope in air of your good looks
10 2407     Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,
10 2408     Ready with every nod to tumble down
10 2409     Into the fatal bowels of the deep.
10 2410   LOVEL. Come, come, dispatch; 'tis bootless to exclaim.
10 2411   HASTINGS. O bloody Richard! Miserable England!
10 2412     I prophesy the fearfull'st time to thee
10 2413     That ever wretched age hath look'd upon.
10 2414     Come, lead me to the block; bear him my head.
10 2415     They smile at me who shortly shall be dead.           Exeunt
10 2416 
10 2417 
10 2418 
10 2419 
10 2420 SCENE 5.
10 2421 
10 2422 London. The Tower-walls
10 2423 
10 2424 Enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM in rotten armour, marvellous
10 2425 ill-favoured
10 2426 
10 2427   GLOUCESTER. Come, cousin, canst thou quake and change
10 2428     thy colour,
10 2429     Murder thy breath in middle of a word,
10 2430     And then again begin, and stop again,
10 2431     As if thou were distraught and mad with terror?
10 2432   BUCKINGHAM. Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian;
10 2433     Speak and look back, and pry on every side,
10 2434     Tremble and start at wagging of a straw,
10 2435     Intending deep suspicion. Ghastly looks
10 2436     Are at my service, like enforced smiles;
10 2437     And both are ready in their offices
10 2438     At any time to grace my stratagems.
10 2439     But what, is Catesby gone?
10 2440   GLOUCESTER. He is; and, see, he brings the mayor along.
10 2441 
10 2442                  Enter the LORD MAYOR and CATESBY
10 2443 
10 2444   BUCKINGHAM. Lord Mayor-
10 2445   GLOUCESTER. Look to the drawbridge there!
10 2446   BUCKINGHAM. Hark! a drum.
10 2447   GLOUCESTER. Catesby, o'erlook the walls.
10 2448   BUCKINGHAM. Lord Mayor, the reason we have sent-
10 2449   GLOUCESTER. Look back, defend thee; here are enemies.
10 2450   BUCKINGHAM. God and our innocence defend and guard us!
10 2451 
10 2452            Enter LOVEL and RATCLIFF, with HASTINGS' head
10 2453 
10 2454   GLOUCESTER. Be patient; they are friends-Ratcliff and Lovel.
10 2455   LOVEL. Here is the head of that ignoble traitor,
10 2456     The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.
10 2457   GLOUCESTER. So dear I lov'd the man that I must weep.
10 2458     I took him for the plainest harmless creature
10 2459     That breath'd upon the earth a Christian;
10 2460     Made him my book, wherein my soul recorded
10 2461     The history of all her secret thoughts.
10 2462     So smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue
10 2463     That, his apparent open guilt omitted,
10 2464     I mean his conversation with Shore's wife-
10 2465     He liv'd from all attainder of suspects.
10 2466   BUCKINGHAM. Well, well, he was the covert'st shelt'red
10 2467     traitor
10 2468     That ever liv'd.
10 2469     Would you imagine, or almost believe-
10 2470     Were't not that by great preservation
10 2471     We live to tell it-that the subtle traitor
10 2472     This day had plotted, in the council-house,
10 2473     To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester.
10 2474   MAYOR. Had he done so?
10 2475   GLOUCESTER. What! think you we are Turks or Infidels?
10 2476     Or that we would, against the form of law,
10 2477     Proceed thus rashly in the villain's death
10 2478     But that the extreme peril of the case,
10 2479     The peace of England and our persons' safety,
10 2480     Enforc'd us to this execution?
10 2481   MAYOR. Now, fair befall you! He deserv'd his death;
10 2482     And your good Graces both have well proceeded
10 2483     To warn false traitors from the like attempts.
10 2484     I never look'd for better at his hands
10 2485     After he once fell in with Mistress Shore.
10 2486   BUCKINGHAM. Yet had we not determin'd he should die
10 2487     Until your lordship came to see his end-
10 2488     Which now the loving haste of these our friends,
10 2489     Something against our meanings, have prevented-
10 2490     Because, my lord, I would have had you heard
10 2491     The traitor speak, and timorously confess
10 2492     The manner and the purpose of his treasons:
10 2493     That you might well have signified the same
10 2494     Unto the citizens, who haply may
10 2495     Misconster us in him and wail his death.
10 2496   MAYOR. But, my good lord, your Grace's words shall serve
10 2497     As well as I had seen and heard him speak;
10 2498     And do not doubt, right noble Princes both,
10 2499     But I'll acquaint our duteous citizens
10 2500     With all your just proceedings in this cause.
10 2501   GLOUCESTER. And to that end we wish'd your lordship here,
10 2502     T' avoid the the the censures of the carping world.
10 2503   BUCKINGHAM. Which since you come too late of our intent,
10 2504     Yet witness what you hear we did intend.
10 2505     And so, my good Lord Mayor, we bid farewell.
10 2506                                                  Exit LORD MAYOR
10 2507   GLOUCESTER. Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham.
10 2508     The Mayor towards Guildhall hies him in an post.
10 2509     There, at your meet'st advantage of the time,
10 2510     Infer the bastardy of Edward's children.
10 2511     Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen
10 2512     Only for saying he would make his son
10 2513     Heir to the crown-meaning indeed his house,
10 2514     Which by the sign thereof was termed so.
10 2515     Moreover, urge his hateful luxury
10 2516     And bestial appetite in change of lust,
10 2517     Which stretch'd unto their servants, daughters, wives,
10 2518     Even where his raging eye or savage heart
10 2519     Without control lusted to make a prey.
10 2520     Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person:
10 2521     Tell them, when that my mother went with child
10 2522     Of that insatiate Edward, noble York
10 2523     My princely father then had wars in France
10 2524     And, by true computation of the time,
10 2525     Found that the issue was not his begot;
10 2526     Which well appeared in his lineaments,
10 2527     Being nothing like the noble Duke my father.
10 2528     Yet touch this sparingly, as 'twere far off;
10 2529     Because, my lord, you know my mother lives.
10 2530   BUCKINGHAM. Doubt not, my lord, I'll play the orator
10 2531     As if the golden fee for which I plead
10 2532     Were for myself; and so, my lord, adieu.
10 2533   GLOUCESTER. If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard's
10 2534     Castle;
10 2535     Where you shall find me well accompanied
10 2536     With reverend fathers and well learned bishops.
10 2537   BUCKINGHAM. I go; and towards three or four o'clock
10 2538     Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.           Exit
10 2539   GLOUCESTER. Go, Lovel, with all speed to Doctor Shaw.
10 2540     [To CATESBY]  Go thou to Friar Penker. Bid them both
10 2541     Meet me within this hour at Baynard's Castle.
10 2542                                        Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER
10 2543     Now will I go to take some privy order
10 2544     To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight,
10 2545     And to give order that no manner person
10 2546     Have any time recourse unto the Princes.                Exit
10 2547 
10 2548

10 2551 SCENE 6.
10 2552 
10 2553 London. A street
10 2554 
10 2555 Enter a SCRIVENER
10 2556 
10 2557   SCRIVENER. Here is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings;
10 2558     Which in a set hand fairly is engross'd
10 2559     That it may be to-day read o'er in Paul's.
10 2560     And mark how well the sequel hangs together:
10 2561     Eleven hours I have spent to write it over,
10 2562     For yesternight by Catesby was it sent me;
10 2563     The precedent was full as long a-doing;
10 2564     And yet within these five hours Hastings liv'd,
10 2565     Untainted, unexamin'd, free, at liberty.
10 2566     Here's a good world the while! Who is so gros
10 2567     That cannot see this palpable device?
10 2568     Yet who's so bold but says he sees it not?
10 2569     Bad is the world; and all will come to nought,
10 2570     When such ill dealing must be seen in thought.          Exit
10 2571 
10 2572 
10 2573 
10 2574 
10 2575 SCENE 7.
10 2576 
10 2577 London. Baynard's Castle
10 2578 
10 2579 Enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM, at several doors
10 2580 
10 2581   GLOUCESTER. How now, how now! What say the citizens?
10 2582   BUCKINGHAM. Now, by the holy Mother of our Lord,
10 2583     The citizens are mum, say not a word.
10 2584   GLOUCESTER. Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's
10 2585     children?
10 2586   BUCKINGHAM. I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy,
10 2587     And his contract by deputy in France;
10 2588     Th' insatiate greediness of his desire,
10 2589     And his enforcement of the city wives;
10 2590     His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,
10 2591     As being got, your father then in France,
10 2592     And his resemblance, being not like the Duke.
10 2593     Withal I did infer your lineaments,
10 2594     Being the right idea of your father,
10 2595     Both in your form and nobleness of mind;
10 2596     Laid open all your victories in Scotland,
10 2597     Your discipline in war, wisdom in peace,
10 2598     Your bounty, virtue, fair humility;
10 2599     Indeed, left nothing fitting for your purpose
10 2600     Untouch'd or slightly handled in discourse.
10 2601     And when mine oratory drew toward end
10 2602     I bid them that did love their country's good
10 2603     Cry 'God save Richard, England's royal King!'
10 2604   GLOUCESTER. And did they so?
10 2605   BUCKINGHAM. No, so God help me, they spake not a word;
10 2606     But, like dumb statues or breathing stones,
10 2607     Star'd each on other, and look'd deadly pale.
10 2608     Which when I saw, I reprehended them,
10 2609     And ask'd the Mayor what meant this wilfull silence.
10 2610     His answer was, the people were not used
10 2611     To be spoke to but by the Recorder.
10 2612     Then he was urg'd to tell my tale again.
10 2613     'Thus saith the Duke, thus hath the Duke inferr'd'-
10 2614     But nothing spoke in warrant from himself.
10 2615     When he had done, some followers of mine own
10 2616     At lower end of the hall hurl'd up their caps,
10 2617     And some ten voices cried 'God save King Richard!'
10 2618     And thus I took the vantage of those few-
10 2619     'Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth I
10 2620     'This general applause and cheerful shout
10 2621     Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard.'
10 2622     And even here brake off and came away.
10 2623   GLOUCESTER. What, tongueless blocks were they? Would
10 2624     they not speak?
10 2625     Will not the Mayor then and his brethren come?
10 2626   BUCKINGHAM. The Mayor is here at hand. Intend some fear;
10 2627     Be not you spoke with but by mighty suit;
10 2628     And look you get a prayer-book in your hand,
10 2629     And stand between two churchmen, good my lord;
10 2630     For on that ground I'll make a holy descant;
10 2631     And be not easily won to our requests.
10 2632     Play the maid's part: still answer nay, and take it.
10 2633   GLOUCESTER. I go; and if you plead as well for them
10 2634     As I can say nay to thee for myself,
10 2635     No doubt we bring it to a happy issue.
10 2636   BUCKINGHAM. Go, go, up to the leads; the Lord Mayor
10 2637     knocks.                                      Exit GLOUCESTER
10 2638 
10 2639            Enter the LORD MAYOR, ALDERMEN, and citizens
10 2640 
10 2641     Welcome, my lord. I dance attendance here;
10 2642     I think the Duke will not be spoke withal.
10 2643 
10 2644                          Enter CATESBY
10 2645 
10 2646     Now, Catesby, what says your lord to my request?
10 2647   CATESBY. He doth entreat your Grace, my noble lord,
10 2648     To visit him to-morrow or next day.
10 2649     He is within, with two right reverend fathers,
10 2650     Divinely bent to meditation;
10 2651     And in no worldly suits would he be mov'd,
10 2652     To draw him from his holy exercise.
10 2653   BUCKINGHAM. Return, good Catesby, to the gracious Duke;
10 2654     Tell him, myself, the Mayor and Aldermen,
10 2655     In deep designs, in matter of great moment,
10 2656     No less importing than our general good,
10 2657     Are come to have some conference with his Grace.
10 2658   CATESBY. I'll signify so much unto him straight.          Exit
10 2659   BUCKINGHAM. Ah ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!
10 2660     He is not lolling on a lewd love-bed,
10 2661     But on his knees at meditation;
10 2662     Not dallying with a brace of courtezans,
10 2663     But meditating with two deep divines;
10 2664     Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,
10 2665     But praying, to enrich his watchful soul.
10 2666     Happy were England would this virtuous prince
10 2667     Take on his Grace the sovereignty thereof;
10 2668     But, sure, I fear we shall not win him to it.
10 2669   MAYOR. Marry, God defend his Grace should say us nay!
10 2670   BUCKINGHAM. I fear he will. Here Catesby comes again.
10 2671 
10 2672                           Re-enter CATESBY
10 2673 
10 2674     Now, Catesby, what says his Grace?
10 2675   CATESBY. My lord,
10 2676     He wonders to what end you have assembled
10 2677     Such troops of citizens to come to him.
10 2678     His Grace not being warn'd thereof before,
10 2679     He fears, my lord, you mean no good to him.
10 2680   BUCKINGHAM. Sorry I am my noble cousin should
10 2681     Suspect me that I mean no good to him.
10 2682     By heaven, we come to him in perfect love;
10 2683     And so once more return and tell his Grace.
10 2684                                                     Exit CATESBY
10 2685     When holy and devout religious men
10 2686     Are at their beads, 'tis much to draw them thence,
10 2687     So sweet is zealous contemplation.
10 2688 
10 2689            Enter GLOUCESTER aloft, between two BISHOPS.
10 2690                       CATESBY returns
10 2691 
10 2692   MAYOR. See where his Grace stands 'tween two clergymen!
10 2693   BUCKINGHAM. Two props of virtue for a Christian prince,
10 2694     To stay him from the fall of vanity;
10 2695     And, see, a book of prayer in his hand,
10 2696     True ornaments to know a holy man.
10 2697     Famous Plantagenet, most gracious Prince,
10 2698     Lend favourable ear to our requests,
10 2699     And pardon us the interruption
10 2700     Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal.
10 2701   GLOUCESTER. My lord, there needs no such apology:
10 2702     I do beseech your Grace to pardon me,
10 2703     Who, earnest in the service of my God,
10 2704     Deferr'd the visitation of my friends.
10 2705     But, leaving this, what is your Grace's pleasure?
10 2706   BUCKINGHAM. Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above,
10 2707     And all good men of this ungovern'd isle.
10 2708   GLOUCESTER. I do suspect I have done some offence
10 2709     That seems disgracious in the city's eye,
10 2710     And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.
10 2711   BUCKINGHAM. You have, my lord. Would it might please
10 2712     your Grace,
10 2713     On our entreaties, to amend your fault!
10 2714   GLOUCESTER. Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?
10 2715   BUCKINGHAM. Know then, it is your fault that you resign
10 2716     The supreme seat, the throne majestical,
10 2717     The scept'red office of your ancestors,
10 2718     Your state of fortune and your due of birth,
10 2719     The lineal glory of your royal house,
10 2720     To the corruption of a blemish'd stock;
10 2721     Whiles in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,
10 2722     Which here we waken to our country's good,
10 2723     The noble isle doth want her proper limbs;
10 2724     Her face defac'd with scars of infamy,
10 2725     Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,
10 2726     And almost should'red in the swallowing gulf
10 2727     Of dark forgetfulness and deep oblivion.
10 2728     Which to recure, we heartily solicit
10 2729     Your gracious self to take on you the charge
10 2730     And kingly government of this your land-
10 2731     Not as protector, steward, substitute,
10 2732     Or lowly factor for another's gain;
10 2733     But as successively, from blood to blood,
10 2734     Your right of birth, your empery, your own.
10 2735     For this, consorted with the citizens,
10 2736     Your very worshipful and loving friends,
10 2737     And by their vehement instigation,
10 2738     In this just cause come I to move your Grace.
10 2739   GLOUCESTER. I cannot tell if to depart in silence
10 2740     Or bitterly to speak in your reproof
10 2741     Best fitteth my degree or your condition.
10 2742     If not to answer, you might haply think
10 2743     Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded
10 2744     To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,
10 2745     Which fondly you would here impose on me;
10 2746     If to reprove you for this suit of yours,
10 2747     So season'd with your faithful love to me,
10 2748     Then, on the other side, I check'd my friends.
10 2749     Therefore-to speak, and to avoid the first,
10 2750     And then, in speaking, not to incur the last-
10 2751     Definitively thus I answer you:
10 2752     Your love deserves my thanks, but my desert
10 2753     Unmeritable shuns your high request.
10 2754     First, if all obstacles were cut away,
10 2755     And that my path were even to the crown,
10 2756     As the ripe revenue and due of birth,
10 2757     Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,
10 2758     So mighty and so many my defects,
10 2759     That I would rather hide me from my greatness-
10 2760     Being a bark to brook no mighty sea-
10 2761     Than in my greatness covet to be hid,
10 2762     And in the vapour of my glory smother'd.
10 2763     But, God be thank'd, there is no need of me-
10 2764     And much I need to help you, were there need.
10 2765     The royal tree hath left us royal fruit
10 2766     Which, mellow'd by the stealing hours of time,
10 2767     Will well become the seat of majesty
10 2768     And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.
10 2769     On him I lay that you would lay on me-
10 2770     The right and fortune of his happy stars,
10 2771     Which God defend that I should wring from him.
10 2772   BUCKINGHAM. My lord, this argues conscience in your
10 2773     Grace;
10 2774     But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,
10 2775     All circumstances well considered.
10 2776     You say that Edward is your brother's son.
10 2777     So say we too, but not by Edward's wife;
10 2778     For first was he contract to Lady Lucy-
10 2779     Your mother lives a witness to his vow-
10 2780     And afterward by substitute betroth'd
10 2781     To Bona, sister to the King of France.
10 2782     These both put off, a poor petitioner,
10 2783     A care-craz'd mother to a many sons,
10 2784     A beauty-waning and distressed widow,
10 2785     Even in the afternoon of her best days,
10 2786     Made prize and purchase of his wanton eye,
10 2787     Seduc'd the pitch and height of his degree
10 2788     To base declension and loath'd bigamy.
10 2789     By her, in his unlawful bed, he got
10 2790     This Edward, whom our manners call the Prince.
10 2791     More bitterly could I expostulate,
10 2792     Save that, for reverence to some alive,
10 2793     I give a sparing limit to my tongue.
10 2794     Then, good my lord, take to your royal self
10 2795     This proffer'd benefit of dignity;
10 2796     If not to bless us and the land withal,
10 2797     Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry
10 2798     From the corruption of abusing times
10 2799     Unto a lineal true-derived course.
10 2800   MAYOR. Do, good my lord; your citizens entreat you.
10 2801   BUCKINGHAM. Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love.
10 2802   CATESBY. O, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit!
10 2803   GLOUCESTER. Alas, why would you heap this care on me?
10 2804     I am unfit for state and majesty.
10 2805     I do beseech you, take it not amiss:
10 2806     I cannot nor I will not yield to you.
10 2807   BUCKINGHAM. If you refuse it-as, in love and zeal,
10 2808     Loath to depose the child, your brother's son;
10 2809     As well we know your tenderness of heart
10 2810     And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,
10 2811     Which we have noted in you to your kindred
10 2812     And egally indeed to all estates-
10 2813     Yet know, whe'er you accept our suit or no,
10 2814     Your brother's son shall never reign our king;
10 2815     But we will plant some other in the throne
10 2816     To the disgrace and downfall of your house;
10 2817     And in this resolution here we leave you.
10 2818     Come, citizens. Zounds, I'll entreat no more.
10 2819   GLOUCESTER. O, do not swear, my lord of Buckingham.
10 2820                           Exeunt BUCKINGHAM, MAYOR, and citizens
10 2821   CATESBY. Call him again, sweet Prince, accept their suit.
10 2822     If you deny them, all the land will rue it.
10 2823   GLOUCESTER. Will you enforce me to a world of cares?
10 2824     Call them again. I am not made of stones,
10 2825     But penetrable to your kind entreaties,
10 2826     Albeit against my conscience and my soul.
10 2827 
10 2828                   Re-enter BUCKINGHAM and the rest
10 2829 
10 2830     Cousin of Buckingham, and sage grave men,
10 2831     Since you will buckle fortune on my back,
10 2832     To bear her burden, whe'er I will or no,
10 2833     I must have patience to endure the load;
10 2834     But if black scandal or foul-fac'd reproach
10 2835     Attend the sequel of your imposition,
10 2836     Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me
10 2837     From all the impure blots and stains thereof;
10 2838     For God doth know, and you may partly see,
10 2839     How far I am from the desire of this.
10 2840   MAYOR. God bless your Grace! We see it, and will say it.
10 2841   GLOUCESTER. In saying so, you shall but say the truth.
10 2842   BUCKINGHAM. Then I salute you with this royal title-
10 2843     Long live King Richard, England's worthy King!
10 2844   ALL. Amen.
10 2845   BUCKINGHAM. To-morrow may it please you to be crown'd?
10 2846   GLOUCESTER. Even when you please, for you will have it so.
10 2847   BUCKINGHAM. To-morrow, then, we will attend your Grace;
10 2848     And so, most joyfully, we take our leave.
10 2849   GLOUCESTER.  [To the BISHOPS]  Come, let us to our holy
10 2850     work again.
10 2851     Farewell, my cousin; farewell, gentle friends.        Exeunt
10 2852

10 2867 ACT IV. SCENE 1.
10 2868 
10 2869 London. Before the Tower
10 2870 
10 2871 Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH, DUCHESS of YORK, and MARQUIS of DORSET, at
10 2872 one door;
10 2873 ANNE, DUCHESS of GLOUCESTER, leading LADY MARGARET PLANTAGENET,
10 2874 CLARENCE's young daughter, at another door
10 2875 
10 2876   DUCHESS. Who meets us here? My niece Plantagenet,
10 2877     Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester?
10 2878     Now, for my life, she's wand'ring to the Tower,
10 2879     On pure heart's love, to greet the tender Princes.
10 2880     Daughter, well met.
10 2881   ANNE. God give your Graces both
10 2882     A happy and a joyful time of day!
10 2883   QUEEN ELIZABETH. As much to you, good sister! Whither
10 2884     away?
10 2885   ANNE. No farther than the Tower; and, as I guess,
10 2886     Upon the like devotion as yourselves,
10 2887     To gratulate the gentle Princes there.
10 2888   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Kind sister, thanks; we'll enter
10 2889     all together.
10 2890 
10 2891                        Enter BRAKENBURY
10 2892 
10 2893     And in good time, here the lieutenant comes.
10 2894     Master Lieutenant, pray you, by your leave,
10 2895     How doth the Prince, and my young son of York?
10 2896   BRAKENBURY. Right well, dear madam. By your patience,
10 2897     I may not suffer you to visit them.
10 2898     The King hath strictly charg'd the contrary.
10 2899   QUEEN ELIZABETH. The King! Who's that?
10 2900   BRAKENBURY. I mean the Lord Protector.
10 2901   QUEEN ELIZABETH. The Lord protect him from that kingly
10 2902     title!
10 2903     Hath he set bounds between their love and me?
10 2904     I am their mother; who shall bar me from them?
10 2905   DUCHESS. I am their father's mother; I will see them.
10 2906   ANNE. Their aunt I am in law, in love their mother.
10 2907     Then bring me to their sights; I'll bear thy blame,
10 2908     And take thy office from thee on my peril.
10 2909   BRAKENBURY. No, madam, no. I may not leave it so;
10 2910     I am bound by oath, and therefore pardon me.            Exit
10 2911 
10 2912                          Enter STANLEY
10 2913 
10 2914   STANLEY. Let me but meet you, ladies, one hour hence,
10 2915     And I'll salute your Grace of York as mother
10 2916     And reverend looker-on of two fair queens.
10 2917     [To ANNE]  Come, madam, you must straight to
10 2918     Westminster,
10 2919     There to be crowned Richard's royal queen.
10 2920   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Ah, cut my lace asunder
10 2921     That my pent heart may have some scope to beat,
10 2922     Or else I swoon with this dead-killing news!
10 2923   ANNE. Despiteful tidings! O unpleasing news!
10 2924   DORSET. Be of good cheer; mother, how fares your Grace?
10 2925   QUEEN ELIZABETH. O Dorset, speak not to me, get thee
10 2926     gone!
10 2927     Death and destruction dogs thee at thy heels;
10 2928     Thy mother's name is ominous to children.
10 2929     If thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas,
10 2930     And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell.
10 2931     Go, hie thee, hie thee from this slaughter-house,
10 2932     Lest thou increase the number of the dead,
10 2933     And make me die the thrall of Margaret's curse,
10 2934     Nor mother, wife, nor England's counted queen.
10 2935   STANLEY. Full of wise care is this your counsel, madam.
10 2936     Take all the swift advantage of the hours;
10 2937     You shall have letters from me to my son
10 2938     In your behalf, to meet you on the way.
10 2939     Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay.
10 2940   DUCHESS. O ill-dispersing wind of misery!
10 2941     O my accursed womb, the bed of death!
10 2942     A cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world,
10 2943     Whose unavoided eye is murderous.
10 2944   STANLEY. Come, madam, come; I in all haste was sent.
10 2945   ANNE. And I with all unwillingness will go.
10 2946     O, would to God that the inclusive verge
10 2947     Of golden metal that must round my brow
10 2948     Were red-hot steel, to sear me to the brains!
10 2949     Anointed let me be with deadly venom,
10 2950     And die ere men can say 'God save the Queen!'
10 2951   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Go, go, poor soul; I envy not thy glory.
10 2952     To feed my humour, wish thyself no harm.
10 2953   ANNE. No, why? When he that is my husband now
10 2954     Came to me, as I follow'd Henry's corse;
10 2955     When scarce the blood was well wash'd from his hands
10 2956     Which issued from my other angel husband,
10 2957     And that dear saint which then I weeping follow'd-
10 2958     O, when, I say, I look'd on Richard's face,
10 2959     This was my wish: 'Be thou' quoth I 'accurs'd
10 2960     For making me, so young, so old a widow;
10 2961     And when thou wed'st, let sorrow haunt thy bed;
10 2962     And be thy wife, if any be so mad,
10 2963     More miserable by the life of thee
10 2964     Than thou hast made me by my dear lord's death.'
10 2965     Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,
10 2966     Within so small a time, my woman's heart
10 2967     Grossly grew captive to his honey words
10 2968     And prov'd the subject of mine own soul's curse,
10 2969     Which hitherto hath held my eyes from rest;
10 2970     For never yet one hour in his bed
10 2971     Did I enjoy the golden dew of sleep,
10 2972     But with his timorous dreams was still awak'd.
10 2973     Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick;
10 2974     And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.
10 2975   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Poor heart, adieu! I pity thy complaining.
10 2976   ANNE. No more than with my soul I mourn for yours.
10 2977   DORSET. Farewell, thou woeful welcomer of glory!
10 2978   ANNE. Adieu, poor soul, that tak'st thy leave of it!
10 2979   DUCHESS.  [To DORSET]  Go thou to Richmond, and good
10 2980     fortune guide thee!
10 2981     [To ANNE]  Go thou to Richard, and good angels tend
10 2982     thee!  [To QUEEN ELIZABETH]  Go thou to sanctuary, and good
10 2983     thoughts possess thee!
10 2984     I to my grave, where peace and rest lie with me!
10 2985     Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
10 2986     And each hour's joy wreck'd with a week of teen.
10 2987   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Stay, yet look back with me unto the
10 2988     Tower.
10 2989     Pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes
10 2990     Whom envy hath immur'd within your walls,
10 2991     Rough cradle for such little pretty ones.
10 2992     Rude ragged nurse, old sullen playfellow
10 2993     For tender princes, use my babies well.
10 2994     So foolish sorrows bids your stones farewell.         Exeunt
10 2995 
10 2996 
10 2997 
10 2998 
10 2999 SCENE 2.
10 3000 
10 3001 London. The palace
10 3002 
10 3003 Sound a sennet. Enter RICHARD, in pomp, as KING; BUCKINGHAM,
10 3004 CATESBY,
10 3005 RATCLIFF, LOVEL, a PAGE, and others
10 3006 
10 3007   KING RICHARD. Stand all apart. Cousin of Buckingham!
10 3008   BUCKINGHAM. My gracious sovereign?
10 3009   KING RICHARD. Give me thy hand.
10 3010                            [Here he ascendeth the throne. Sound]
10 3011     Thus high, by thy advice
10 3012     And thy assistance, is King Richard seated.
10 3013     But shall we wear these glories for a day;
10 3014     Or shall they last, and we rejoice in them?
10 3015   BUCKINGHAM. Still live they, and for ever let them last!
10 3016   KING RICHARD. Ah, Buckingham, now do I play the touch,
10 3017     To try if thou be current gold indeed.
10 3018     Young Edward lives-think now what I would speak.
10 3019   BUCKINGHAM. Say on, my loving lord.
10 3020   KING RICHARD. Why, Buckingham, I say I would be King.
10 3021   BUCKINGHAM. Why, so you are, my thrice-renowned lord.
10 3022   KING RICHARD. Ha! am I King? 'Tis so; but Edward lives.
10 3023   BUCKINGHAM. True, noble Prince.
10 3024   KING RICHARD. O bitter consequence:
10 3025     That Edward still should live-true noble Prince!
10 3026     Cousin, thou wast not wont to be so dull.
10 3027     Shall I be plain? I wish the bastards dead.
10 3028     And I would have it suddenly perform'd.
10 3029     What say'st thou now? Speak suddenly, be brief.
10 3030   BUCKINGHAM. Your Grace may do your pleasure.
10 3031   KING RICHARD. Tut, tut, thou art all ice; thy kindness freezes.
10 3032     Say, have I thy consent that they shall die?
10 3033   BUCKINGHAM. Give me some little breath, some pause,
10 3034     dear Lord,
10 3035     Before I positively speak in this.
10 3036     I will resolve you herein presently.                    Exit
10 3037   CATESBY.  [Aside to another]  The King is angry; see, he
10 3038     gnaws his lip.
10 3039   KING RICHARD. I will converse with iron-witted fools
10 3040                                       [Descends from the throne]
10 3041     And unrespective boys; none are for me
10 3042     That look into me with considerate eyes.
10 3043     High-reaching Buckingham grows circumspect.
10 3044     Boy!
10 3045   PAGE. My lord?
10 3046   KING RICHARD. Know'st thou not any whom corrupting
10 3047     gold
10 3048     Will tempt unto a close exploit of death?
10 3049   PAGE. I know a discontented gentleman
10 3050     Whose humble means match not his haughty spirit.
10 3051     Gold were as good as twenty orators,
10 3052     And will, no doubt, tempt him to anything.
10 3053   KING RICHARD. What is his name?
10 3054   PAGE. His name, my lord, is Tyrrel.
10 3055   KING RICHARD. I partly know the man. Go, call him hither,
10 3056     boy.                                               Exit PAGE
10 3057     The deep-revolving witty Buckingham
10 3058     No more shall be the neighbour to my counsels.
10 3059     Hath he so long held out with me, untir'd,
10 3060     And stops he now for breath? Well, be it so.
10 3061 
10 3062                             Enter STANLEY
10 3063 
10 3064     How now, Lord Stanley! What's the news?
10 3065   STANLEY. Know, my loving lord,
10 3066     The Marquis Dorset, as I hear, is fled
10 3067     To Richmond, in the parts where he abides.    [Stands apart]
10 3068   KING RICHARD. Come hither, Catesby. Rumour it abroad
10 3069     That Anne, my wife, is very grievous sick;
10 3070     I will take order for her keeping close.
10 3071     Inquire me out some mean poor gentleman,
10 3072     Whom I will marry straight to Clarence' daughter-
10 3073     The boy is foolish, and I fear not him.
10 3074     Look how thou dream'st! I say again, give out
10 3075     That Anne, my queen, is sick and like to die.
10 3076     About it; for it stands me much upon
10 3077     To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me.
10 3078                                                     Exit CATESBY
10 3079     I must be married to my brother's daughter,
10 3080     Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass.
10 3081     Murder her brothers, and then marry her!
10 3082     Uncertain way of gain! But I am in
10 3083     So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin.
10 3084     Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye.
10 3085 
10 3086                      Re-enter PAGE, with TYRREL
10 3087 
10 3088     Is thy name Tyrrel?
10 3089   TYRREL. James Tyrrel, and your most obedient subject.
10 3090   KING RICHARD. Art thou, indeed?
10 3091   TYRREL. Prove me, my gracious lord.
10 3092   KING RICHARD. Dar'st'thou resolve to kill a friend of mine?
10 3093   TYRREL. Please you;
10 3094     But I had rather kill two enemies.
10 3095   KING RICHARD. Why, then thou hast it. Two deep enemies,
10 3096     Foes to my rest, and my sweet sleep's disturbers,
10 3097     Are they that I would have thee deal upon.
10 3098   TYRREL, I mean those bastards in the Tower.
10 3099   TYRREL. Let me have open means to come to them,
10 3100     And soon I'll rid you from the fear of them.
10 3101   KING RICHARD. Thou sing'st sweet music. Hark, come
10 3102     hither, Tyrrel.
10 3103     Go, by this token. Rise, and lend thine ear.      [Whispers]
10 3104     There is no more but so: say it is done,
10 3105     And I will love thee and prefer thee for it.
10 3106   TYRREL. I will dispatch it straight.                      Exit
10 3107 
10 3108                     Re-enter BUCKINGHAM
10 3109 
10 3110     BUCKINGHAM. My lord, I have consider'd in my mind
10 3111     The late request that you did sound me in.
10 3112   KING RICHARD. Well, let that rest. Dorset is fled to
10 3113     Richmond.
10 3114   BUCKINGHAM. I hear the news, my lord.
10 3115   KING RICHARD. Stanley, he is your wife's son: well, look
10 3116     unto it.
10 3117   BUCKINGHAM. My lord, I claim the gift, my due by promise,
10 3118     For which your honour and your faith is pawn'd:
10 3119     Th' earldom of Hereford and the movables
10 3120     Which you have promised I shall possess.
10 3121   KING RICHARD. Stanley, look to your wife; if she convey
10 3122     Letters to Richmond, you shall answer it.
10 3123   BUCKINGHAM. What says your Highness to my just request?
10 3124   KING RICHARD. I do remember me: Henry the Sixth
10 3125     Did prophesy that Richmond should be King,
10 3126     When Richmond was a little peevish boy.
10 3127     A king!-perhaps-
10 3128   BUCKINGHAM. My lord-
10 3129   KING RICHARD. How chance the prophet could not at that
10 3130     time
10 3131     Have told me, I being by, that I should kill him?
10 3132   BUCKINGHAM. My lord, your promise for the earldom-
10 3133   KING RICHARD. Richmond! When last I was at Exeter,
10 3134     The mayor in courtesy show'd me the castle
10 3135     And call'd it Rugemount, at which name I started,
10 3136     Because a bard of Ireland told me once
10 3137     I should not live long after I saw Richmond.
10 3138   BUCKINGHAM. My lord-
10 3139   KING RICHARD. Ay, what's o'clock?
10 3140   BUCKINGHAM. I am thus bold to put your Grace in mind
10 3141     Of what you promis'd me.
10 3142   KING RICHARD. Well, but o'clock?
10 3143   BUCKINGHAM. Upon the stroke of ten.
10 3144   KING RICHARD. Well, let it strike.
10 3145   BUCKINGHAM. Why let it strike?
10 3146   KING RICHARD. Because that like a Jack thou keep'st the
10 3147     stroke
10 3148     Betwixt thy begging and my meditation.
10 3149     I am not in the giving vein to-day.
10 3150   BUCKINGHAM. May it please you to resolve me in my suit.
10 3151   KING RICHARD. Thou troublest me; I am not in the vein.
10 3152                                        Exeunt all but Buckingham
10 3153   BUCKINGHAM. And is it thus? Repays he my deep service
10 3154     With such contempt? Made I him King for this?
10 3155     O, let me think on Hastings, and be gone
10 3156     To Brecknock while my fearful head is on!               Exit

10 3161 SCENE 3.
10 3162 
10 3163 London. The palace
10 3164 
10 3165 Enter TYRREL
10 3166 
10 3167   TYRREL. The tyrannous and bloody act is done,
10 3168     The most arch deed of piteous massacre
10 3169     That ever yet this land was guilty of.
10 3170     Dighton and Forrest, who I did suborn
10 3171     To do this piece of ruthless butchery,
10 3172     Albeit they were flesh'd villains, bloody dogs,
10 3173     Melted with tenderness and mild compassion,
10 3174     Wept like two children in their deaths' sad story.
10 3175     'O, thus' quoth Dighton 'lay the gentle babes'-
10 3176     'Thus, thus,' quoth Forrest 'girdling one another
10 3177     Within their alabaster innocent arms.
10 3178     Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,
10 3179     And in their summer beauty kiss'd each other.
10 3180     A book of prayers on their pillow lay;
10 3181     Which once,' quoth Forrest 'almost chang'd my mind;
10 3182     But, O, the devil'-there the villain stopp'd;
10 3183     When Dighton thus told on: 'We smothered
10 3184     The most replenished sweet work of nature
10 3185     That from the prime creation e'er she framed.'
10 3186     Hence both are gone with conscience and remorse
10 3187     They could not speak; and so I left them both,
10 3188     To bear this tidings to the bloody King.
10 3189 
10 3190                         Enter KING RICHARD
10 3191 
10 3192     And here he comes. All health, my sovereign lord!
10 3193   KING RICHARD. Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news?
10 3194   TYRREL. If to have done the thing you gave in charge
10 3195     Beget your happiness, be happy then,
10 3196     For it is done.
10 3197   KING RICHARD. But didst thou see them dead?
10 3198   TYRREL. I did, my lord.
10 3199   KING RICHARD. And buried, gentle Tyrrel?
10 3200   TYRREL. The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them;
10 3201     But where, to say the truth, I do not know.
10 3202   KING RICHARD. Come to me, Tyrrel, soon at after supper,
10 3203     When thou shalt tell the process of their death.
10 3204     Meantime, but think how I may do thee good
10 3205     And be inheritor of thy desire.
10 3206     Farewell till then.
10 3207   TYRREL. I humbly take my leave.                           Exit
10 3208   KING RICHARD. The son of Clarence have I pent up close;
10 3209     His daughter meanly have I match'd in marriage;
10 3210     The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom,
10 3211     And Anne my wife hath bid this world good night.
10 3212     Now, for I know the Britaine Richmond aims
10 3213     At young Elizabeth, my brother's daughter,
10 3214     And by that knot looks proudly on the crown,
10 3215     To her go I, a jolly thriving wooer.
10 3216 
10 3217                            Enter RATCLIFF
10 3218 
10 3219   RATCLIFF. My lord!
10 3220   KING RICHARD. Good or bad news, that thou com'st in so
10 3221     bluntly?
10 3222   RATCLIFF. Bad news, my lord: Morton is fled to Richmond;
10 3223     And Buckingham, back'd with the hardy Welshmen,
10 3224     Is in the field, and still his power increaseth.
10 3225   KING RICHARD. Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
10 3226     Than Buckingham and his rash-levied strength.
10 3227     Come, I have learn'd that fearful commenting
10 3228     Is leaden servitor to dull delay;
10 3229     Delay leads impotent and snail-pac'd beggary.
10 3230     Then fiery expedition be my wing,
10 3231     Jove's Mercury, and herald for a king!
10 3232     Go, muster men. My counsel is my shield.
10 3233     We must be brief when traitors brave the field.       Exeunt
10 3234 
10 3235 
10 3236 
10 3237 
10 3238 SCENE 4.
10 3239 
10 3240 London. Before the palace
10 3241 
10 3242 Enter old QUEEN MARGARET
10 3243 
10 3244   QUEEN MARGARET. So now prosperity begins to mellow
10 3245     And drop into the rotten mouth of death.
10 3246     Here in these confines slily have I lurk'd
10 3247     To watch the waning of mine enemies.
10 3248     A dire induction am I witness to,
10 3249     And will to France, hoping the consequence
10 3250     Will prove as bitter, black, and tragical.
10 3251     Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret. Who comes here?
10 3252                                                        [Retires]
10 3253 
10 3254            Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH and the DUCHESS OF YORK
10 3255 
10 3256   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Ah, my poor princes! ah, my tender
10 3257     babes!
10 3258     My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets!
10 3259     If yet your gentle souls fly in the air
10 3260     And be not fix'd in doom perpetual,
10 3261     Hover about me with your airy wings
10 3262     And hear your mother's lamentation.
10 3263   QUEEN MARGARET. Hover about her; say that right for right
10 3264     Hath dimm'd your infant morn to aged night.
10 3265   DUCHESS. So many miseries have craz'd my voice
10 3266     That my woe-wearied tongue is still and mute.
10 3267     Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?
10 3268   QUEEN MARGARET. Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet,
10 3269     Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.
10 3270   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Wilt thou, O God, fly from such gentle
10 3271     lambs
10 3272     And throw them in the entrails of the wolf?
10 3273     When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done?
10 3274   QUEEN MARGARET. When holy Harry died, and my sweet
10 3275     son.
10 3276   DUCHESS. Dead life, blind sight, poor mortal living ghost,
10 3277     Woe's scene, world's shame, grave's due by life usurp'd,
10 3278     Brief abstract and record of tedious days,
10 3279     Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,    [Sitting down]
10 3280     Unlawfully made drunk with innocent blood.
10 3281   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Ah, that thou wouldst as soon afford a
10 3282     grave
10 3283     As thou canst yield a melancholy seat!
10 3284     Then would I hide my bones, not rest them here.
10 3285     Ah, who hath any cause to mourn but we?
10 3286                                            [Sitting down by her]
10 3287   QUEEN MARGARET.  [Coming forward]  If ancient sorrow be
10 3288     most reverend,
10 3289     Give mine the benefit of seniory,
10 3290     And let my griefs frown on the upper hand.
10 3291     If sorrow can admit society,        [Sitting down with them]
10 3292     Tell o'er your woes again by viewing mine.
10 3293     I had an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;
10 3294     I had a husband, till a Richard kill'd him:
10 3295     Thou hadst an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;
10 3296     Thou hadst a Richard, till a Richard kill'd him.
10 3297   DUCHESS. I had a Richard too, and thou didst kill him;
10 3298     I had a Rutland too, thou holp'st to kill him.
10 3299   QUEEN MARGARET. Thou hadst a Clarence too, and Richard
10 3300     kill'd him.
10 3301     From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept
10 3302     A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death.
10 3303     That dog, that had his teeth before his eyes
10 3304     To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood,
10 3305     That foul defacer of God's handiwork,
10 3306     That excellent grand tyrant of the earth
10 3307     That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls,
10 3308     Thy womb let loose to chase us to our graves.
10 3309     O upright, just, and true-disposing God,
10 3310     How do I thank thee that this carnal cur
10 3311     Preys on the issue of his mother's body
10 3312     And makes her pew-fellow with others' moan!
10 3313   DUCHESS. O Harry's wife, triumph not in my woes!
10 3314     God witness with me, I have wept for thine.
10 3315   QUEEN MARGARET. Bear with me; I am hungry for revenge,
10 3316     And now I cloy me with beholding it.
10 3317     Thy Edward he is dead, that kill'd my Edward;
10 3318     The other Edward dead, to quit my Edward;
10 3319     Young York he is but boot, because both they
10 3320     Match'd not the high perfection of my loss.
10 3321     Thy Clarence he is dead that stabb'd my Edward;
10 3322     And the beholders of this frantic play,
10 3323     Th' adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey,
10 3324     Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves.
10 3325     Richard yet lives, hell's black intelligencer;
10 3326     Only reserv'd their factor to buy souls
10 3327     And send them thither. But at hand, at hand,
10 3328     Ensues his piteous and unpitied end.
10 3329     Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray,
10 3330     To have him suddenly convey'd from hence.
10 3331     Cancel his bond of life, dear God, I pray,
10 3332     That I may live and say 'The dog is dead.'
10 3333   QUEEN ELIZABETH. O, thou didst prophesy the time would
10 3334       come
10 3335     That I should wish for thee to help me curse
10 3336     That bottled spider, that foul bunch-back'd toad!
10 3337   QUEEN MARGARET. I Call'd thee then vain flourish of my
10 3338       fortune;
10 3339     I call'd thee then poor shadow, painted queen,
10 3340     The presentation of but what I was,
10 3341     The flattering index of a direful pageant,
10 3342     One heav'd a-high to be hurl'd down below,
10 3343     A mother only mock'd with two fair babes,
10 3344     A dream of what thou wast, a garish flag
10 3345     To be the aim of every dangerous shot,
10 3346     A sign of dignity, a breath, a bubble,
10 3347     A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.
10 3348     Where is thy husband now? Where be thy brothers?
10 3349     Where be thy two sons? Wherein dost thou joy?
10 3350     Who sues, and kneels, and says 'God save the Queen'?
10 3351     Where be the bending peers that flattered thee?
10 3352     Where be the thronging troops that followed thee?
10 3353     Decline an this, and see what now thou art:
10 3354     For happy wife, a most distressed widow;
10 3355     For joyful mother, one that wails the name;
10 3356     For one being su'd to, one that humbly sues;
10 3357     For Queen, a very caitiff crown'd with care;
10 3358     For she that scorn'd at me, now scorn'd of me;
10 3359     For she being fear'd of all, now fearing one;
10 3360     For she commanding all, obey'd of none.
10 3361     Thus hath the course of justice whirl'd about
10 3362     And left thee but a very prey to time,
10 3363     Having no more but thought of what thou wast
10 3364     To torture thee the more, being what thou art.
10 3365     Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not
10 3366     Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?
10 3367     Now thy proud neck bears half my burden'd yoke,
10 3368     From which even here I slip my weary head
10 3369     And leave the burden of it all on thee.
10 3370     Farewell, York's wife, and queen of sad mischance;
10 3371     These English woes shall make me smile in France.
10 3372   QUEEN ELIZABETH. O thou well skill'd in curses, stay awhile
10 3373     And teach me how to curse mine enemies!
10 3374   QUEEN MARGARET. Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the
10 3375       days;
10 3376     Compare dead happiness with living woe;
10 3377     Think that thy babes were sweeter than they were,
10 3378     And he that slew them fouler than he is.
10 3379     Bett'ring thy loss makes the bad-causer worse;
10 3380     Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.
10 3381   QUEEN ELIZABETH. My words are dull; O, quicken them
10 3382     with thine!
10 3383   QUEEN MARGARET. Thy woes will make them sharp and
10 3384     pierce like mine.                                       Exit
10 3385   DUCHESS. Why should calamity be fun of words?
10 3386   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Windy attorneys to their client woes,
10 3387     Airy succeeders of intestate joys,
10 3388     Poor breathing orators of miseries,
10 3389     Let them have scope; though what they will impart
10 3390     Help nothing else, yet do they case the heart.
10 3391   DUCHESS. If so, then be not tongue-tied. Go with me,
10 3392     And in the breath of bitter words let's smother
10 3393     My damned son that thy two sweet sons smother'd.
10 3394     The trumpet sounds; be copious in exclaims.
10 3395 
10 3396          Enter KING RICHARD and his train, marching with
10 3397                      drums and trumpets
10 3398 
10 3399   KING RICHARD. Who intercepts me in my expedition?
10 3400   DUCHESS. O, she that might have intercepted thee,
10 3401     By strangling thee in her accursed womb,
10 3402     From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done!
10 3403   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Hidest thou that forehead with a golden
10 3404     crown
10 3405     Where't should be branded, if that right were right,
10 3406     The slaughter of the Prince that ow'd that crown,
10 3407     And the dire death of my poor sons and brothers?
10 3408     Tell me, thou villain slave, where are my children?
10 3409   DUCHESS. Thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother
10 3410     Clarence?
10 3411     And little Ned Plantagenet, his son?
10 3412   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Where is the gentle Rivers, Vaughan,
10 3413     Grey?
10 3414   DUCHESS. Where is kind Hastings?
10 3415   KING RICHARD. A flourish, trumpets! Strike alarum, drums!
10 3416     Let not the heavens hear these tell-tale women
10 3417     Rail on the Lord's anointed. Strike, I say!
10 3418                                              [Flourish. Alarums]
10 3419     Either be patient and entreat me fair,
10 3420     Or with the clamorous report of war
10 3421     Thus will I drown your exclamations.
10 3422   DUCHESS. Art thou my son?
10 3423   KING RICHARD. Ay, I thank God, my father, and yourself.
10 3424   DUCHESS. Then patiently hear my impatience.
10 3425   KING RICHARD. Madam, I have a touch of your condition
10 3426     That cannot brook the accent of reproof.
10 3427   DUCHESS. O, let me speak!
10 3428   KING RICHARD. Do, then; but I'll not hear.
10 3429   DUCHESS. I will be mild and gentle in my words.
10 3430   KING RICHARD. And brief, good mother; for I am in haste.
10 3431   DUCHESS. Art thou so hasty? I have stay'd for thee,
10 3432     God knows, in torment and in agony.
10 3433   KING RICHARD. And came I not at last to comfort you?
10 3434   DUCHESS. No, by the holy rood, thou know'st it well
10 3435     Thou cam'st on earth to make the earth my hell.
10 3436     A grievous burden was thy birth to me;
10 3437     Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy;
10 3438     Thy school-days frightful, desp'rate, wild, and furious;
10 3439     Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous;
10 3440     Thy age confirm'd, proud, subtle, sly, and bloody,
10 3441     More mild, but yet more harmful-kind in hatred.
10 3442     What comfortable hour canst thou name
10 3443     That ever grac'd me with thy company?
10 3444   KING RICHARD. Faith, none but Humphrey Hour, that call'd
10 3445     your Grace
10 3446     To breakfast once forth of my company.
10 3447     If I be so disgracious in your eye,
10 3448     Let me march on and not offend you, madam.
10 3449     Strike up the drum.
10 3450   DUCHESS. I prithee hear me speak.
10 3451   KING RICHARD. You speak too bitterly.
10 3452   DUCHESS. Hear me a word;
10 3453     For I shall never speak to thee again.
10 3454   KING RICHARD. So.
10 3455   DUCHESS. Either thou wilt die by God's just ordinance
10 3456     Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror;
10 3457     Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish
10 3458     And never more behold thy face again.
10 3459     Therefore take with thee my most grievous curse,
10 3460     Which in the day of battle tire thee more
10 3461     Than all the complete armour that thou wear'st!
10 3462     My prayers on the adverse party fight;
10 3463     And there the little souls of Edward's children
10 3464     Whisper the spirits of thine enemies
10 3465     And promise them success and victory.
10 3466     Bloody thou art; bloody will be thy end.
10 3467     Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.        Exit
10 3468   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Though far more cause, yet much less
10 3469       spirit to curse
10 3470     Abides in me; I say amen to her.
10 3471   KING RICHARD. Stay, madam, I must talk a word with you.
10 3472   QUEEN ELIZABETH. I have no moe sons of the royal blood
10 3473     For thee to slaughter. For my daughters, Richard,
10 3474     They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens;
10 3475     And therefore level not to hit their lives.
10 3476   KING RICHARD. You have a daughter call'd Elizabeth.
10 3477     Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.
10 3478   QUEEN ELIZABETH. And must she die for this? O, let her
10 3479       live,
10 3480     And I'll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty,
10 3481     Slander myself as false to Edward's bed,
10 3482     Throw over her the veil of infamy;
10 3483     So she may live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter,
10 3484     I will confess she was not Edward's daughter.
10 3485   KING RICHARD. Wrong not her birth; she is a royal
10 3486     Princess.
10 3487   QUEEN ELIZABETH. To save her life I'll say she is not so.
10 3488   KING RICHARD. Her life is safest only in her birth.
10 3489   QUEEN ELIZABETH. And only in that safety died her
10 3490       brothers.
10 3491   KING RICHARD. Lo, at their birth good stars were opposite.
10 3492   QUEEN ELIZABETH. No, to their lives ill friends were
10 3493       contrary.
10 3494   KING RICHARD. All unavoided is the doom of destiny.
10 3495   QUEEN ELIZABETH. True, when avoided grace makes destiny.
10 3496     My babes were destin'd to a fairer death,
10 3497     If grace had bless'd thee with a fairer life.
10 3498   KING RICHARD. You speak as if that I had slain my cousins.
10 3499   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Cousins, indeed; and by their uncle
10 3500       cozen'd
10 3501     Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life.
10 3502     Whose hand soever lanc'd their tender hearts,
10 3503     Thy head, an indirectly, gave direction.
10 3504     No doubt the murd'rous knife was dull and blunt
10 3505     Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart
10 3506     To revel in the entrails of my lambs.
10 3507     But that stiff use of grief makes wild grief tame,
10 3508     My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys
10 3509     Till that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes;
10 3510     And I, in such a desp'rate bay of death,
10 3511     Like a poor bark, of sails and tackling reft,
10 3512     Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.
10 3513   KING RICHARD. Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise
10 3514     And dangerous success of bloody wars,
10 3515     As I intend more good to you and yours
10 3516     Than ever you or yours by me were harm'd!
10 3517   QUEEN ELIZABETH. What good is cover'd with the face of
10 3518       heaven,
10 3519     To be discover'd, that can do me good?
10 3520   KING RICHARD. advancement of your children, gentle
10 3521     lady.
10 3522   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Up to some scaffold, there to lose their
10 3523     heads?
10 3524   KING RICHARD. Unto the dignity and height of Fortune,
10 3525     The high imperial type of this earth's glory.
10 3526   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Flatter my sorrow with report of it;
10 3527     Tell me what state, what dignity, what honour,
10 3528     Canst thou demise to any child of mine?
10 3529   KING RICHARD. Even all I have-ay, and myself and all
10 3530     Will I withal endow a child of thine;
10 3531     So in the Lethe of thy angry soul
10 3532     Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs
10 3533     Which thou supposest I have done to thee.
10 3534   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Be brief, lest that the process of thy
10 3535       kindness
10 3536     Last longer telling than thy kindness' date.
10 3537   KING RICHARD. Then know, that from my soul I love thy
10 3538     daughter.
10 3539   QUEEN ELIZABETH. My daughter's mother thinks it with her
10 3540     soul.
10 3541   KING RICHARD. What do you think?
10 3542   QUEEN ELIZABETH. That thou dost love my daughter from
10 3543       thy soul.
10 3544     So from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers,
10 3545     And from my heart's love I do thank thee for it.
10 3546   KING RICHARD. Be not so hasty to confound my meaning.
10 3547     I mean that with my soul I love thy daughter
10 3548     And do intend to make her Queen of England.
10 3549   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Well, then, who dost thou mean shall be
10 3550     her king?
10 3551   KING RICHARD. Even he that makes her Queen. Who else
10 3552     should be?
10 3553   QUEEN ELIZABETH. What, thou?
10 3554   KING RICHARD. Even so. How think you of it?
10 3555   QUEEN ELIZABETH. How canst thou woo her?
10 3556   KING RICHARD. That would I learn of you,
10 3557     As one being best acquainted with her humour.
10 3558   QUEEN ELIZABETH. And wilt thou learn of me?
10 3559   KING RICHARD. Madam, with all my heart.
10 3560   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Send to her, by the man that slew her
10 3561     brothers,
10 3562     A pair of bleeding hearts; thereon engrave
10 3563     'Edward' and 'York.' Then haply will she weep;
10 3564     Therefore present to her-as sometimes Margaret
10 3565     Did to thy father, steep'd in Rutland's blood-
10 3566     A handkerchief; which, say to her, did drain
10 3567     The purple sap from her sweet brother's body,
10 3568     And bid her wipe her weeping eyes withal.
10 3569     If this inducement move her not to love,
10 3570     Send her a letter of thy noble deeds;
10 3571     Tell her thou mad'st away her uncle Clarence,
10 3572     Her uncle Rivers; ay, and for her sake
10 3573     Mad'st quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne.
10 3574   KING RICHARD. You mock me, madam; this is not the way
10 3575     To win your daughter.
10 3576   QUEEN ELIZABETH. There is no other way;
10 3577     Unless thou couldst put on some other shape
10 3578     And not be Richard that hath done all this.
10 3579   KING RICHARD. Say that I did all this for love of her.
10 3580   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Nay, then indeed she cannot choose but
10 3581       hate thee,
10 3582     Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.
10 3583   KING RICHARD. Look what is done cannot be now amended.
10 3584     Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,
10 3585     Which after-hours gives leisure to repent.
10 3586     If I did take the kingdom from your sons,
10 3587     To make amends I'll give it to your daughter.
10 3588     If I have kill'd the issue of your womb,
10 3589     To quicken your increase I will beget
10 3590     Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter.
10 3591     A grandam's name is little less in love
10 3592     Than is the doating title of a mother;
10 3593     They are as children but one step below,
10 3594     Even of your metal, of your very blood;
10 3595     Of all one pain, save for a night of groans
10 3596     Endur'd of her, for whom you bid like sorrow.
10 3597     Your children were vexation to your youth;
10 3598     But mine shall be a comfort to your age.
10 3599     The loss you have is but a son being King,
10 3600     And by that loss your daughter is made Queen.
10 3601     I cannot make you what amends I would,
10 3602     Therefore accept such kindness as I can.
10 3603     Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul
10 3604     Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,
10 3605     This fair alliance quickly shall can home
10 3606     To high promotions and great dignity.
10 3607     The King, that calls your beauteous daughter wife,
10 3608     Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother;
10 3609     Again shall you be mother to a king,
10 3610     And all the ruins of distressful times
10 3611     Repair'd with double riches of content.
10 3612     What! we have many goodly days to see.
10 3613     The liquid drops of tears that you have shed
10 3614     Shall come again, transform'd to orient pearl,
10 3615     Advantaging their loan with interest
10 3616     Of ten times double gain of happiness.
10 3617     Go, then, my mother, to thy daughter go;
10 3618     Make bold her bashful years with your experience;
10 3619     Prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale;
10 3620     Put in her tender heart th' aspiring flame
10 3621     Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the Princes
10 3622     With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys.
10 3623     And when this arm of mine hath chastised
10 3624     The petty rebel, dull-brain'd Buckingham,
10 3625     Bound with triumphant garlands will I come,
10 3626     And lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed;
10 3627     To whom I will retail my conquest won,
10 3628     And she shall be sole victoress, Caesar's Caesar.
10 3629   QUEEN ELIZABETH. What were I best to say? Her father's
10 3630       brother
10 3631     Would be her lord? Or shall I say her uncle?
10 3632     Or he that slew her brothers and her uncles?
10 3633     Under what title shall I woo for thee
10 3634     That God, the law, my honour, and her love
10 3635     Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?
10 3636   KING RICHARD. Infer fair England's peace by this alliance.
10 3637   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Which she shall purchase with
10 3638     still-lasting war.
10 3639   KING RICHARD. Tell her the King, that may command,
10 3640     entreats.
10 3641   QUEEN ELIZABETH. That at her hands which the King's
10 3642     King forbids.
10 3643   KING RICHARD. Say she shall be a high and mighty queen.
10 3644   QUEEN ELIZABETH. To wail the title, as her mother doth.
10 3645   KING RICHARD. Say I will love her everlastingly.
10 3646   QUEEN ELIZABETH. But how long shall that title 'ever' last?
10 3647   KING RICHARD. Sweetly in force unto her fair life's end.
10 3648   QUEEN ELIZABETH. But how long fairly shall her sweet life
10 3649     last?
10 3650   KING RICHARD. As long as heaven and nature lengthens it.
10 3651   QUEEN ELIZABETH. As long as hell and Richard likes of it.
10 3652   KING RICHARD. Say I, her sovereign, am her subject low.
10 3653   QUEEN ELIZABETH. But she, your subject, loathes such
10 3654     sovereignty.
10 3655   KING RICHARD. Be eloquent in my behalf to her.
10 3656   QUEEN ELIZABETH. An honest tale speeds best being plainly
10 3657     told.
10 3658   KING RICHARD. Then plainly to her tell my loving tale.
10 3659   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.
10 3660   KING RICHARD. Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.
10 3661   QUEEN ELIZABETH. O, no, my reasons are too deep and
10 3662       dead-
10 3663     Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their graves.
10 3664   KING RICHARD. Harp not on that string, madam; that is past.
10 3665   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Harp on it still shall I till heartstrings
10 3666     break.
10 3667   KING RICHARD. Now, by my George, my garter, and my
10 3668     crown-
10 3669   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Profan'd, dishonour'd, and the third
10 3670     usurp'd.
10 3671   KING RICHARD. I swear-
10 3672   QUEEN ELIZABETH. By nothing; for this is no oath:
10 3673     Thy George, profan'd, hath lost his lordly honour;
10 3674     Thy garter, blemish'd, pawn'd his knightly virtue;
10 3675     Thy crown, usurp'd, disgrac'd his kingly glory.
10 3676     If something thou wouldst swear to be believ'd,
10 3677     Swear then by something that thou hast not wrong'd.
10 3678   KING RICHARD. Then, by my self-
10 3679   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Thy self is self-misus'd.
10 3680   KING RICHARD. Now, by the world-
10 3681   QUEEN ELIZABETH. 'Tis full of thy foul wrongs.
10 3682   KING RICHARD. My father's death-
10 3683   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Thy life hath it dishonour'd.
10 3684   KING RICHARD. Why, then, by God-
10 3685   QUEEN ELIZABETH. God's wrong is most of all.
10 3686     If thou didst fear to break an oath with Him,
10 3687     The unity the King my husband made
10 3688     Thou hadst not broken, nor my brothers died.
10 3689     If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,
10 3690     Th' imperial metal, circling now thy head,
10 3691     Had grac'd the tender temples of my child;
10 3692     And both the Princes had been breathing here,
10 3693     Which now, two tender bedfellows for dust,
10 3694     Thy broken faith hath made the prey for worms.
10 3695     What canst thou swear by now?
10 3696   KING RICHARD. The time to come.
10 3697   QUEEN ELIZABETH. That thou hast wronged in the time
10 3698     o'erpast;
10 3699     For I myself have many tears to wash
10 3700     Hereafter time, for time past wrong'd by thee.
10 3701     The children live whose fathers thou hast slaughter'd,
10 3702     Ungovern'd youth, to wail it in their age;
10 3703     The parents live whose children thou hast butcheed,
10 3704     Old barren plants, to wail it with their age.
10 3705     Swear not by time to come; for that thou hast
10 3706     Misus'd ere us'd, by times ill-us'd o'erpast.
10 3707   KING RICHARD. As I intend to prosper and repent,
10 3708     So thrive I in my dangerous affairs
10 3709     Of hostile arms! Myself myself confound!
10 3710     Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours!
10 3711     Day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy rest!
10 3712     Be opposite all planets of good luck
10 3713     To my proceeding!-if, with dear heart's love,
10 3714     Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts,
10 3715     I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter.
10 3716     In her consists my happiness and thine;
10 3717     Without her, follows to myself and thee,
10 3718     Herself, the land, and many a Christian soul,
10 3719     Death, desolation, ruin, and decay.
10 3720     It cannot be avoided but by this;
10 3721     It will not be avoided but by this.
10 3722     Therefore, dear mother-I must call you so-
10 3723     Be the attorney of my love to her;
10 3724     Plead what I will be, not what I have been;
10 3725     Not my deserts, but what I will deserve.
10 3726     Urge the necessity and state of times,
10 3727     And be not peevish-fond in great designs.
10 3728   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?
10 3729   KING RICHARD. Ay, if the devil tempt you to do good.
10 3730   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Shall I forget myself to be myself?
10 3731   KING RICHARD. Ay, if your self's remembrance wrong
10 3732     yourself.
10 3733   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Yet thou didst kill my children.
10 3734   KING RICHARD. But in your daughter's womb I bury them;
10 3735     Where, in that nest of spicery, they will breed
10 3736     Selves of themselves, to your recomforture.
10 3737   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Shall I go win my daughter to thy will?
10 3738   KING RICHARD. And be a happy mother by the deed.
10 3739   QUEEN ELIZABETH. I go. Write to me very shortly,
10 3740     And you shall understand from me her mind.
10 3741   KING RICHARD. Bear her my true love's kiss; and so, farewell.
10 3742                                Kissing her. Exit QUEEN ELIZABETH
10 3743     Relenting fool, and shallow, changing woman!
10 3744 
10 3745                  Enter RATCLIFF; CATESBY following
10 3746 
10 3747     How now! what news?
10 3748   RATCLIFF. Most mighty sovereign, on the western coast
10 3749     Rideth a puissant navy; to our shores
10 3750     Throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends,
10 3751     Unarm'd, and unresolv'd to beat them back.
10 3752     'Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral;
10 3753     And there they hull, expecting but the aid
10 3754     Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore.
10 3755   KING RICHARD. Some light-foot friend post to the Duke of
10 3756     Norfolk.
10 3757     Ratcliff, thyself-or Catesby; where is he?
10 3758   CATESBY. Here, my good lord.
10 3759   KING RICHARD. Catesby, fly to the Duke.
10 3760   CATESBY. I will my lord, with all convenient haste.
10 3761   KING RICHARD. Ratcliff, come hither. Post to Salisbury;
10 3762     When thou com'st thither-  [To CATESBY]  Dull,
10 3763     unmindfull villain,
10 3764     Why stay'st thou here, and go'st not to the Duke?
10 3765   CATESBY. First, mighty liege, tell me your Highness' pleasure,
10 3766     What from your Grace I shall deliver to him.
10 3767   KING RICHARD. O, true, good Catesby. Bid him levy straight
10 3768     The greatest strength and power that he can make
10 3769     And meet me suddenly at Salisbury.
10 3770   CATESBY. I go.                                            Exit
10 3771   RATCLIFF. What, may it please you, shall I do at Salisbury?
10 3772   KING RICHARD. Why, what wouldst thou do there before I
10 3773     go?
10 3774   RATCLIFF. Your Highness told me I should post before.
10 3775   KING RICHARD. My mind is chang'd.
10 3776 
10 3777                            Enter LORD STANLEY
10 3778 
10 3779   STANLEY, what news with you?
10 3780   STANLEY. None good, my liege, to please you with
10 3781     the hearing;
10 3782     Nor none so bad but well may be reported.
10 3783   KING RICHARD. Hoyday, a riddle! neither good nor bad!
10 3784     What need'st thou run so many miles about,
10 3785     When thou mayest tell thy tale the nearest way?
10 3786     Once more, what news?
10 3787   STANLEY. Richmond is on the seas.
10 3788   KING RICHARD. There let him sink, and be the seas on him!
10 3789     White-liver'd runagate, what doth he there?
10 3790   STANLEY. I know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess.
10 3791   KING RICHARD. Well, as you guess?
10 3792   STANLEY. Stirr'd up by Dorset, Buckingham, and Morton,
10 3793     He makes for England here to claim the crown.
10 3794   KING RICHARD. Is the chair empty? Is the sword unsway'd?
10 3795     Is the King dead, the empire unpossess'd?
10 3796     What heir of York is there alive but we?
10 3797     And who is England's King but great York's heir?
10 3798     Then tell me what makes he upon the seas.
10 3799   STANLEY. Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess.
10 3800   KING RICHARD. Unless for that he comes to be your liege,
10 3801     You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes.
10 3802     Thou wilt revolt and fly to him, I fear.
10 3803   STANLEY. No, my good lord; therefore mistrust me not.
10 3804   KING RICHARD. Where is thy power then, to beat him back?
10 3805     Where be thy tenants and thy followers?
10 3806     Are they not now upon the western shore,
10 3807     Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships?
10 3808   STANLEY. No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.
10 3809   KING RICHARD. Cold friends to me. What do they in the
10 3810     north,
10 3811     When they should serve their sovereign in the west?
10 3812   STANLEY. They have not been commanded, mighty King.
10 3813     Pleaseth your Majesty to give me leave,
10 3814     I'll muster up my friends and meet your Grace
10 3815     Where and what time your Majesty shall please.
10 3816   KING RICHARD. Ay, ay, thou wouldst be gone to join with
10 3817     Richmond;
10 3818     But I'll not trust thee.
10 3819   STANLEY. Most mighty sovereign,
10 3820     You have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful.
10 3821     I never was nor never will be false.
10 3822   KING RICHARD. Go, then, and muster men. But leave behind
10 3823     Your son, George Stanley. Look your heart be firm,
10 3824     Or else his head's assurance is but frail.
10 3825   STANLEY. So deal with him as I prove true to you.         Exit
10 3826 
10 3827                           Enter a MESSENGER
10 3828 
10 3829   MESSENGER. My gracious sovereign, now in Devonshire,
10 3830     As I by friends am well advertised,
10 3831     Sir Edward Courtney and the haughty prelate,
10 3832     Bishop of Exeter, his elder brother,
10 3833     With many moe confederates, are in arms.

10 3835                          Enter another MESSENGER
10 3836 
10 3837   SECOND MESSENGER. In Kent, my liege, the Guilfords are in
10 3838     arms;
10 3839     And every hour more competitors
10 3840     Flock to the rebels, and their power grows strong.
10 3841 
10 3842                          Enter another MESSENGER
10 3843 
10 3844   THIRD MESSENGER. My lord, the army of great Buckingham-
10 3845   KING RICHARD. Out on you, owls! Nothing but songs of
10 3846     death?                                      [He strikes him]
10 3847     There, take thou that till thou bring better news.
10 3848   THIRD MESSENGER. The news I have to tell your Majesty
10 3849     Is that by sudden floods and fall of waters
10 3850     Buckingham's army is dispers'd and scatter'd;
10 3851     And he himself wand'red away alone,
10 3852     No man knows whither.
10 3853   KING RICHARD. I cry thee mercy.
10 3854     There is my purse to cure that blow of thine.
10 3855     Hath any well-advised friend proclaim'd
10 3856     Reward to him that brings the traitor in?
10 3857   THIRD MESSENGER. Such proclamation hath been made,
10 3858     my Lord.
10 3859 
10 3860                       Enter another MESSENGER
10 3861 
10 3862   FOURTH MESSENGER. Sir Thomas Lovel and Lord Marquis
10 3863     Dorset,
10 3864     'Tis said, my liege, in Yorkshire are in arms.
10 3865     But this good comfort bring I to your Highness-
10 3866     The Britaine navy is dispers'd by tempest.
10 3867     Richmond in Dorsetshire sent out a boat
10 3868     Unto the shore, to ask those on the banks
10 3869     If they were his assistants, yea or no;
10 3870     Who answer'd him they came from Buckingham
10 3871     Upon his party. He, mistrusting them,
10 3872     Hois'd sail, and made his course again for Britaine.
10 3873   KING RICHARD. March on, march on, since we are up in
10 3874     arms;
10 3875     If not to fight with foreign enemies,
10 3876     Yet to beat down these rebels here at home.
10 3877 
10 3878                           Re-enter CATESBY
10 3879 
10 3880   CATESBY. My liege, the Duke of Buckingham is taken-
10 3881     That is the best news. That the Earl of Richmond
10 3882     Is with a mighty power landed at Milford
10 3883     Is colder tidings, yet they must be told.
10 3884   KING RICHARD. Away towards Salisbury! While we reason
10 3885     here
10 3886     A royal battle might be won and lost.
10 3887     Some one take order Buckingham be brought
10 3888     To Salisbury; the rest march on with me.
10 3889     Flourish.                                             Exeunt

10 3898 Enter STANLEY and SIR CHRISTOPHER URSWICK
10 3899 
10 3900   STANLEY. Sir Christopher, tell Richmond this from me:
10 3901     That in the sty of the most deadly boar
10 3902     My son George Stanley is frank'd up in hold;
10 3903     If I revolt, off goes young George's head;
10 3904     The fear of that holds off my present aid.
10 3905     So, get thee gone; commend me to thy lord.
10 3906     Withal say that the Queen hath heartily consented
10 3907     He should espouse Elizabeth her daughter.
10 3908     But tell me, where is princely Richmond now?
10 3909   CHRISTOPHER. At Pembroke, or at Ha'rford west in Wales.
10 3910   STANLEY. What men of name resort to him?
10 3911   CHRISTOPHER. Sir Walter Herbert, a renowned soldier;
10 3912   SIR Gilbert Talbot, Sir William Stanley,
10 3913   OXFORD, redoubted Pembroke, Sir James Blunt,
10 3914     And Rice ap Thomas, with a valiant crew;
10 3915     And many other of great name and worth;
10 3916     And towards London do they bend their power,
10 3917     If by the way they be not fought withal.
10 3918   STANLEY. Well, hie thee to thy lord; I kiss his hand;
10 3919     My letter will resolve him of my mind.
10 3920     Farewell.                                             Exeunt

10 3938 Salisbury. An open place
10 3939 
10 3940 Enter the SHERIFF and guard, with BUCKINGHAM, led to execution
10 3941 
10 3942   BUCKINGHAM. Will not King Richard let me speak with
10 3943     him?
10 3944   SHERIFF. No, my good lord; therefore be patient.
10 3945   BUCKINGHAM. Hastings, and Edward's children, Grey, and
10 3946     Rivers,
10 3947     Holy King Henry, and thy fair son Edward,
10 3948     Vaughan, and all that have miscarried
10 3949     By underhand corrupted foul injustice,
10 3950     If that your moody discontented souls
10 3951     Do through the clouds behold this present hour,
10 3952     Even for revenge mock my destruction!
10 3953     This is All-Souls' day, fellow, is it not?
10 3954   SHERIFF. It is, my lord.
10 3955   BUCKINGHAM. Why, then All-Souls' day is my body's
10 3956     doomsday.
10 3957     This is the day which in King Edward's time
10 3958     I wish'd might fall on me when I was found
10 3959     False to his children and his wife's allies;
10 3960     This is the day wherein I wish'd to fall
10 3961     By the false faith of him whom most I trusted;
10 3962     This, this All-Souls' day to my fearful soul
10 3963     Is the determin'd respite of my wrongs;
10 3964     That high All-Seer which I dallied with
10 3965     Hath turn'd my feigned prayer on my head
10 3966     And given in earnest what I begg'd in jest.
10 3967     Thus doth He force the swords of wicked men
10 3968     To turn their own points in their masters' bosoms.
10 3969     Thus Margaret's curse falls heavy on my neck.
10 3970     'When he' quoth she 'shall split thy heart with sorrow,
10 3971     Remember Margaret was a prophetess.'
10 3972     Come lead me, officers, to the block of shame;
10 3973     Wrong hath but wrong, and blame the due of blame.

10 3981 Camp near Tamworth
10 3982 
10 3983 Enter RICHMOND, OXFORD, SIR JAMES BLUNT, SIR WALTER HERBERT, and
10 3984 others,
10 3985 with drum and colours
10 3986 
10 3987   RICHMOND. Fellows in arms, and my most loving friends,
10 3988     Bruis'd underneath the yoke of tyranny,
10 3989     Thus far into the bowels of the land
10 3990     Have we march'd on without impediment;
10 3991     And here receive we from our father Stanley
10 3992     Lines of fair comfort and encouragement.
10 3993     The wretched, bloody, and usurping boar,
10 3994     That spoil'd your summer fields and fruitful vines,
10 3995     Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough
10 3996     In your embowell'd bosoms-this foul swine
10 3997     Is now even in the centre of this isle,
10 3998     Near to the town of Leicester, as we learn.
10 3999     From Tamworth thither is but one day's march.
10 4000     In God's name cheerly on, courageous friends,
10 4001     To reap the harvest of perpetual peace
10 4002     By this one bloody trial of sharp war.
10 4003   OXFORD. Every man's conscience is a thousand men,
10 4004     To fight against this guilty homicide.
10 4005   HERBERT. I doubt not but his friends will turn to us.
10 4006   BLUNT. He hath no friends but what are friends for fear,
10 4007     Which in his dearest need will fly from him.
10 4008   RICHMOND. All for our vantage. Then in God's name march.
10 4009     True hope is swift and flies with swallow's wings;
10 4010     Kings it makes gods, and meaner creatures kings.      Exeunt

10 4017 Bosworth Field
10 4018 
10 4019 Enter KING RICHARD in arms, with NORFOLK, RATCLIFF,
10 4020 the EARL of SURREYS and others
10 4021 
10 4022   KING RICHARD. Here pitch our tent, even here in Bosworth
10 4023     field.
10 4024     My Lord of Surrey, why look you so sad?
10 4025   SURREY. My heart is ten times lighter than my looks.
10 4026   KING RICHARD. My Lord of Norfolk!
10 4027   NORFOLK. Here, most gracious liege.
10 4028   KING RICHARD. Norfolk, we must have knocks; ha! must we
10 4029     not?
10 4030   NORFOLK. We must both give and take, my loving lord.
10 4031   KING RICHARD. Up With my tent! Here will I lie to-night;
10 4032                       [Soldiers begin to set up the KING'S tent]
10 4033     But where to-morrow? Well, all's one for that.
10 4034     Who hath descried the number of the traitors?
10 4035   NORFOLK. Six or seven thousand is their utmost power.
10 4036   KING RICHARD. Why, our battalia trebles that account;
10 4037     Besides, the King's name is a tower of strength,
10 4038     Which they upon the adverse faction want.
10 4039     Up with the tent! Come, noble gentlemen,
10 4040     Let us survey the vantage of the ground.
10 4041     Call for some men of sound direction.
10 4042     Let's lack no discipline, make no delay;
10 4043     For, lords, to-morrow is a busy day.                  Exeunt
10 4044 
10 4045              Enter, on the other side of the field,
10 4046           RICHMOND, SIR WILLIAM BRANDON, OXFORD, DORSET,
10 4047               and others. Some pitch RICHMOND'S tent
10 4048 
10 4049   RICHMOND. The weary sun hath made a golden set,
10 4050     And by the bright tract of his fiery car
10 4051     Gives token of a goodly day to-morrow.
10 4052     Sir William Brandon, you shall bear my standard.
10 4053     Give me some ink and paper in my tent.
10 4054     I'll draw the form and model of our battle,
10 4055     Limit each leader to his several charge,
10 4056     And part in just proportion our small power.
10 4057     My Lord of Oxford-you, Sir William Brandon-
10 4058     And you, Sir Walter Herbert-stay with me.
10 4059     The Earl of Pembroke keeps his regiment;
10 4060     Good Captain Blunt, bear my good night to him,
10 4061     And by the second hour in the morning
10 4062     Desire the Earl to see me in my tent.
10 4063     Yet one thing more, good Captain, do for me-
10 4064     Where is Lord Stanley quarter'd, do you know?
10 4065   BLUNT. Unless I have mista'en his colours much-
10 4066     Which well I am assur'd I have not done-
10 4067     His regiment lies half a mile at least
10 4068     South from the mighty power of the King.
10 4069   RICHMOND. If without peril it be possible,
10 4070     Sweet Blunt, make some good means to speak with him
10 4071     And give him from me this most needful note.
10 4072   BLUNT. Upon my life, my lord, I'll undertake it;
10 4073     And so, God give you quiet rest to-night!
10 4074   RICHMOND. Good night, good Captain Blunt. Come,
10 4075     gentlemen,
10 4076     Let us consult upon to-morrow's business.
10 4077     In to my tent; the dew is raw and cold.
10 4078                                    [They withdraw into the tent]
10 4079 
10 4080             Enter, to his-tent, KING RICHARD, NORFOLK,
10 4081                        RATCLIFF, and CATESBY
10 4082 
10 4083   KING RICHARD. What is't o'clock?
10 4084   CATESBY. It's supper-time, my lord;
10 4085     It's nine o'clock.
10 4086   KING RICHARD. I will not sup to-night.
10 4087     Give me some ink and paper.
10 4088     What, is my beaver easier than it was?
10 4089     And all my armour laid into my tent?
10 4090   CATESBY. It is, my liege; and all things are in readiness.
10 4091   KING RICHARD. Good Norfolk, hie thee to thy charge;
10 4092     Use careful watch, choose trusty sentinels.
10 4093   NORFOLK. I go, my lord.
10 4094   KING RICHARD. Stir with the lark to-morrow, gentle Norfolk.
10 4095   NORFOLK. I warrant you, my lord.                          Exit
10 4096   KING RICHARD. Catesby!
10 4097   CATESBY. My lord?
10 4098   KING RICHARD. Send out a pursuivant-at-arms
10 4099     To Stanley's regiment; bid him bring his power
10 4100     Before sunrising, lest his son George fall
10 4101     Into the blind cave of eternal night.           Exit CATESBY
10 4102     Fill me a bowl of wine. Give me a watch.
10 4103     Saddle white Surrey for the field to-morrow.
10 4104     Look that my staves be sound, and not too heavy.
10 4105     Ratcliff!
10 4106   RATCLIFF. My lord?
10 4107   KING RICHARD. Saw'st thou the melancholy Lord
10 4108     Northumberland?
10 4109   RATCLIFF. Thomas the Earl of Surrey and himself,
10 4110     Much about cock-shut time, from troop to troop
10 4111     Went through the army, cheering up the soldiers.
10 4112   KING RICHARD. So, I am satisfied. Give me a bowl of wine.
10 4113     I have not that alacrity of spirit
10 4114     Nor cheer of mind that I was wont to have.
10 4115     Set it down. Is ink and paper ready?
10 4116   RATCLIFF. It is, my lord.
10 4117   KING RICHARD. Bid my guard watch; leave me.
10 4118   RATCLIFF, about the mid of night come to my tent
10 4119     And help to arm me. Leave me, I say.
10 4120                                    Exit RATCLIFF. RICHARD sleeps
10 4121 
10 4122                Enter DERBY to RICHMOND in his tent;
10 4123                         LORDS attending
10 4124 
10 4125   DERBY. Fortune and victory sit on thy helm!
10 4126   RICHMOND. All comfort that the dark night can afford
10 4127     Be to thy person, noble father-in-law!
10 4128     Tell me, how fares our loving mother?
10 4129   DERBY. I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,
10 4130     Who prays continually for Richmond's good.
10 4131     So much for that. The silent hours steal on,
10 4132     And flaky darkness breaks within the east.
10 4133     In brief, for so the season bids us be,
10 4134     Prepare thy battle early in the morning,
10 4135     And put thy fortune to the arbitrement
10 4136     Of bloody strokes and mortal-staring war.
10 4137     I, as I may-that which I would I cannot-
10 4138     With best advantage will deceive the time
10 4139     And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms;
10 4140     But on thy side I may not be too forward,
10 4141     Lest, being seen, thy brother, tender George,
10 4142     Be executed in his father's sight.
10 4143     Farewell; the leisure and the fearful time
10 4144     Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love
10 4145     And ample interchange of sweet discourse
10 4146     Which so-long-sund'red friends should dwell upon.
10 4147     God give us leisure for these rites of love!
10 4148     Once more, adieu; be valiant, and speed well!
10 4149   RICHMOND. Good lords, conduct him to his regiment.
10 4150     I'll strive with troubled thoughts to take a nap,
10 4151     Lest leaden slumber peise me down to-morrow
10 4152     When I should mount with wings of victory.
10 4153     Once more, good night, kind lords and gentlemen.
10 4154                                          Exeunt all but RICHMOND
10 4155     O Thou, whose captain I account myself,
10 4156     Look on my forces with a gracious eye;
10 4157     Put in their hands Thy bruising irons of wrath,
10 4158     That they may crush down with a heavy fall
10 4159     The usurping helmets of our adversaries!
10 4160     Make us Thy ministers of chastisement,
10 4161     That we may praise Thee in the victory!
10 4162     To Thee I do commend my watchful soul
10 4163     Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes.
10 4164     Sleeping and waking, O, defend me still!            [Sleeps]
10 4165 
10 4166             Enter the GHOST Of YOUNG PRINCE EDWARD,
10 4167                     son to HENRY THE SIXTH
10 4168 
10 4169   GHOST.  [To RICHARD]  Let me sit heavy on thy soul
10 4170     to-morrow!
10 4171     Think how thou stabb'dst me in my prime of youth
10 4172     At Tewksbury; despair, therefore, and die!
10 4173     [To RICHMOND]  Be cheerful, Richmond; for the wronged
10 4174     souls
10 4175     Of butcher'd princes fight in thy behalf.
10 4176     King Henry's issue, Richmond, comforts thee.
10 4177 
10 4178               Enter the GHOST of HENRY THE SIXTH
10 4179 
10 4180   GHOST.  [To RICHARD]  When I was mortal, my anointed
10 4181     body
10 4182     By thee was punched full of deadly holes.
10 4183     Think on the Tower and me. Despair, and die.
10 4184     Harry the Sixth bids thee despair and die.
10 4185     [To RICHMOND]  Virtuous and holy, be thou conqueror!
10 4186     Harry, that prophesied thou shouldst be King,
10 4187     Doth comfort thee in thy sleep. Live and flourish!
10 4188 
10 4189                    Enter the GHOST of CLARENCE
10 4190 
10 4191   GHOST.  [To RICHARD]  Let me sit heavy in thy soul
10 4192     to-morrow! I that was wash'd to death with fulsome wine,
10 4193     Poor Clarence, by thy guile betray'd to death!
10 4194     To-morrow in the battle think on me,
10 4195     And fall thy edgeless sword. Despair and die!
10 4196     [To RICHMOND]  Thou offspring of the house of Lancaster,
10 4197     The wronged heirs of York do pray for thee.
10 4198     Good angels guard thy battle! Live and flourish!
10 4199 
10 4200            Enter the GHOSTS of RIVERS, GREY, and VAUGHAN
10 4201 
10 4202   GHOST OF RIVERS.  [To RICHARD]  Let me sit heavy in thy
10 4203     soul to-morrow,
10 4204     Rivers that died at Pomfret! Despair and die!
10 4205   GHOST OF GREY.  [To RICHARD]  Think upon Grey, and let
10 4206     thy soul despair!
10 4207   GHOST OF VAUGHAN.  [To RICHARD]  Think upon Vaughan,
10 4208     and with guilty fear
10 4209     Let fall thy lance. Despair and die!
10 4210   ALL.  [To RICHMOND]  Awake, and think our wrongs in
10 4211     Richard's bosom
10 4212     Will conquer him. Awake and win the day.
10 4213 
10 4214                 Enter the GHOST of HASTINGS
10 4215 
10 4216   GHOST.  [To RICHARD]  Bloody and guilty, guiltily awake,
10 4217     And in a bloody battle end thy days!
10 4218     Think on Lord Hastings. Despair and die.
10 4219     [To RICHMOND]   Quiet untroubled soul, awake, awake!
10 4220     Arm, fight, and conquer, for fair England's sake!
10 4221 
10 4222          Enter the GHOSTS of the two young PRINCES
10 4223 
10 4224   GHOSTS.  [To RICHARD]  Dream on thy cousins smothered in
10 4225     the Tower.
10 4226     Let us be lead within thy bosom, Richard,
10 4227     And weigh thee down to ruin, shame, and death!
10 4228     Thy nephews' souls bid thee despair and die.
10 4229     [To RICHMOND]  Sleep, Richmond, sleep in peace, and
10 4230     wake in joy;
10 4231     Good angels guard thee from the boar's annoy!
10 4232     Live, and beget a happy race of kings!
10 4233     Edward's unhappy sons do bid thee flourish.
10 4234 
10 4235           Enter the GHOST of LADY ANNE, his wife
10 4236 
10 4237   GHOST.  [To RICHARD]  Richard, thy wife, that wretched
10 4238     Anne thy wife
10 4239     That never slept a quiet hour with thee
10 4240     Now fills thy sleep with perturbations.
10 4241     To-morrow in the battle think on me,
10 4242     And fall thy edgeless sword. Despair and die.
10 4243     [To RICHMOND]  Thou quiet soul, sleep thou a quiet sleep;
10 4244     Dream of success and happy victory.
10 4245     Thy adversary's wife doth pray for thee.
10 4246 
10 4247                    Enter the GHOST of BUCKINGHAM
10 4248 
10 4249   GHOST.  [To RICHARD]  The first was I that help'd thee
10 4250     to the crown;
10 4251     The last was I that felt thy tyranny.
10 4252     O, in the battle think on Buckingham,
10 4253     And die in terror of thy guiltiness!
10 4254     Dream on, dream on of bloody deeds and death;
10 4255     Fainting, despair; despairing, yield thy breath!
10 4256     [To RICHMOND]  I died for hope ere I could lend thee aid;
10 4257     But cheer thy heart and be thou not dismay'd:
10 4258     God and good angels fight on Richmond's side;
10 4259     And Richard falls in height of all his pride.
10 4260             [The GHOSTS vanish. RICHARD starts out of his dream]
10 4261   KING RICHARD. Give me another horse. Bind up my wounds.
10 4262     Have mercy, Jesu! Soft! I did but dream.
10 4263     O coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me!
10 4264     The lights burn blue. It is now dead midnight.
10 4265     Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh.
10 4266     What do I fear? Myself? There's none else by.
10 4267     Richard loves Richard; that is, I am I.
10 4268     Is there a murderer here? No-yes, I am.
10 4269     Then fly. What, from myself? Great reason why-
10 4270     Lest I revenge. What, myself upon myself!
10 4271     Alack, I love myself. Wherefore? For any good
10 4272     That I myself have done unto myself?
10 4273     O, no! Alas, I rather hate myself
10 4274     For hateful deeds committed by myself!
10 4275     I am a villain; yet I lie, I am not.
10 4276     Fool, of thyself speak well. Fool, do not flatter.
10 4277     My conscience hath a thousand several tongues,
10 4278     And every tongue brings in a several tale,
10 4279     And every tale condemns me for a villain.
10 4280     Perjury, perjury, in the high'st degree;
10 4281     Murder, stern murder, in the dir'st degree;
10 4282     All several sins, all us'd in each degree,
10 4283     Throng to the bar, crying all 'Guilty! guilty!'
10 4284     I shall despair. There is no creature loves me;
10 4285     And if I die no soul will pity me:
10 4286     And wherefore should they, since that I myself
10 4287     Find in myself no pity to myself?
10 4288     Methought the souls of all that I had murder'd
10 4289     Came to my tent, and every one did threat
10 4290     To-morrow's vengeance on the head of Richard.
10 4291 
10 4292                             Enter RATCLIFF
10 4293 
10 4294   RATCLIFF. My lord!
10 4295   KING RICHARD. Zounds, who is there?
10 4296   RATCLIFF. Ratcliff, my lord; 'tis I. The early village-cock
10 4297     Hath twice done salutation to the morn;
10 4298     Your friends are up and buckle on their armour.
10 4299   KING RICHARD. O Ratcliff, I have dream'd a fearful dream!
10 4300     What think'st thou-will our friends prove all true?
10 4301   RATCLIFF. No doubt, my lord.
10 4302   KING RICHARD. O Ratcliff, I fear, I fear.
10 4303   RATCLIFF. Nay, good my lord, be not afraid of shadows.
10 4304   KING RICHARD By the apostle Paul, shadows to-night
10 4305     Have stuck more terror to the soul of Richard
10 4306     Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers
10 4307     Armed in proof and led by shallow Richmond.
10 4308     'Tis not yet near day. Come, go with me;
10 4309     Under our tents I'll play the eaves-dropper,
10 4310     To see if any mean to shrink from me.                 Exeunt
10 4311 
10 4312           Enter the LORDS to RICHMOND sitting in his tent
10 4313 
10 4314   LORDS. Good morrow, Richmond!
10 4315   RICHMOND. Cry mercy, lords and watchful gentlemen,
10 4316     That you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here.
10 4317   LORDS. How have you slept, my lord?
10 4318   RICHMOND. The sweetest sleep and fairest-boding dreams
10 4319     That ever ent'red in a drowsy head
10 4320     Have I since your departure had, my lords.
10 4321     Methought their souls whose bodies Richard murder'd
10 4322     Came to my tent and cried on victory.
10 4323     I promise you my soul is very jocund
10 4324     In the remembrance of so fair a dream.
10 4325     How far into the morning is it, lords?
10 4326   LORDS. Upon the stroke of four.
10 4327   RICHMOND. Why, then 'tis time to arm and give direction.
10 4328 
10 4329                  His ORATION to his SOLDIERS
10 4330 
10 4331     More than I have said, loving countrymen,
10 4332     The leisure and enforcement of the time
10 4333     Forbids to dwell upon; yet remember this:
10 4334     God and our good cause fight upon our side;
10 4335     The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls,
10 4336     Like high-rear'd bulwarks, stand before our faces;
10 4337     Richard except, those whom we fight against
10 4338     Had rather have us win than him they follow.
10 4339     For what is he they follow? Truly, gentlemen,
10 4340     A bloody tyrant and a homicide;
10 4341     One rais'd in blood, and one in blood establish'd;
10 4342     One that made means to come by what he hath,
10 4343     And slaughtered those that were the means to help him;
10 4344     A base foul stone, made precious by the foil
10 4345     Of England's chair, where he is falsely set;
10 4346     One that hath ever been God's enemy.
10 4347     Then if you fight against God's enemy,
10 4348     God will in justice ward you as his soldiers;
10 4349     If you do sweat to put a tyrant down,
10 4350     You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain;
10 4351     If you do fight against your country's foes,
10 4352     Your country's foes shall pay your pains the hire;
10 4353     If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,
10 4354     Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors;
10 4355     If you do free your children from the sword,
10 4356     Your children's children quits it in your age.
10 4357     Then, in the name of God and all these rights,
10 4358     Advance your standards, draw your willing swords.
10 4359     For me, the ransom of my bold attempt
10 4360     Shall be this cold corpse on the earth's cold face;
10 4361     But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt
10 4362     The least of you shall share his part thereof.
10 4363     Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully;
10 4364     God and Saint George! Richmond and victory!           Exeunt
10 4365 
10 4366            Re-enter KING RICHARD, RATCLIFF, attendants,
10 4367                          and forces
10 4368 
10 4369   KING RICHARD. What said Northumberland as touching
10 4370     Richmond?
10 4371   RATCLIFF. That he was never trained up in arms.
10 4372   KING RICHARD. He said the truth; and what said Surrey
10 4373     then?
10 4374   RATCLIFF. He smil'd, and said 'The better for our purpose.'
10 4375   KING He was in the right; and so indeed it is.
10 4376                                                  [Clock strikes]
10 4377     Tell the clock there. Give me a calendar.
10 4378     Who saw the sun to-day?
10 4379   RATCLIFF. Not I, my lord.
10 4380   KING RICHARD. Then he disdains to shine; for by the book
10 4381     He should have brav'd the east an hour ago.
10 4382     A black day will it be to somebody.
10 4383     Ratcliff!
10 4384   RATCLIFF. My lord?
10 4385   KING RICHARD. The sun will not be seen to-day;
10 4386     The sky doth frown and lour upon our army.
10 4387     I would these dewy tears were from the ground.
10 4388     Not shine to-day! Why, what is that to me
10 4389     More than to Richmond? For the selfsame heaven
10 4390     That frowns on me looks sadly upon him.
10 4391 
10 4392                        Enter NORFOLK
10 4393 
10 4394   NORFOLK. Arm, arm, my lord; the foe vaunts in the field.
10 4395   KING RICHARD. Come, bustle, bustle; caparison my horse;
10 4396     Call up Lord Stanley, bid him bring his power.
10 4397     I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain,
10 4398     And thus my battle shall be ordered:
10 4399     My foreward shall be drawn out all in length,
10 4400     Consisting equally of horse and foot;
10 4401     Our archers shall be placed in the midst.
10 4402     John Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Earl of Surrey,
10 4403     Shall have the leading of this foot and horse.
10 4404     They thus directed, we will follow
10 4405     In the main battle, whose puissance on either side
10 4406     Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse.
10 4407     This, and Saint George to boot! What think'st thou,
10 4408     Norfolk?
10 4409   NORFOLK. A good direction, warlike sovereign.
10 4410     This found I on my tent this morning.
10 4411                                         [He sheweth him a paper]
10 4412   KING RICHARD.                                          [Reads]
10 4413     'Jockey of Norfolk, be not so bold,
10 4414     For Dickon thy master is bought and sold.'
10 4415     A thing devised by the enemy.
10 4416     Go, gentlemen, every man unto his charge.
10 4417     Let not our babbling dreams affright our souls;
10 4418     Conscience is but a word that cowards use,
10 4419     Devis'd at first to keep the strong in awe.
10 4420     Our strong arms be our conscience, swords our law.
10 4421     March on, join bravely, let us to it pell-mell;
10 4422     If not to heaven, then hand in hand to hell.
10 4423 
10 4424                       His ORATION to his ARMY
10 4425 
10 4426     What shall I say more than I have inferr'd?
10 4427     Remember whom you are to cope withal-
10 4428     A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways,
10 4429     A scum of Britaines, and base lackey peasants,
10 4430     Whom their o'er-cloyed country vomits forth
10 4431     To desperate adventures and assur'd destruction.
10 4432     You sleeping safe, they bring to you unrest;
10 4433     You having lands, and bless'd with beauteous wives,
10 4434     They would restrain the one, distain the other.
10 4435     And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow,
10 4436     Long kept in Britaine at our mother's cost?
10 4437     A milk-sop, one that never in his life
10 4438     Felt so much cold as over shoes in snow?
10 4439     Let's whip these stragglers o'er the seas again;
10 4440     Lash hence these over-weening rags of France,
10 4441     These famish'd beggars, weary of their lives;
10 4442     Who, but for dreaming on this fond exploit,
10 4443     For want of means, poor rats, had hang'd themselves.
10 4444     If we be conquered, let men conquer us,
10 4445     And not these bastard Britaines, whom our fathers
10 4446     Have in their own land beaten, bobb'd, and thump'd,
10 4447     And, in record, left them the heirs of shame.
10 4448     Shall these enjoy our lands? lie with our wives,
10 4449     Ravish our daughters?  [Drum afar off]  Hark! I hear their
10 4450     drum.
10 4451     Fight, gentlemen of England! Fight, bold yeomen!
10 4452     Draw, archers, draw your arrows to the head!
10 4453     Spur your proud horses hard, and ride in blood;
10 4454     Amaze the welkin with your broken staves!
10 4455 
10 4456                         Enter a MESSENGER
10 4457 
10 4458     What says Lord Stanley? Will he bring his power?
10 4459   MESSENGER. My lord, he doth deny to come.
10 4460   KING RICHARD. Off with his son George's head!
10 4461   NORFOLK. My lord, the enemy is pass'd the marsh.
10 4462     After the battle let George Stanley die.
10 4463   KING RICHARD. A thousand hearts are great within my
10 4464     bosom.
10 4465     Advance our standards, set upon our foes;
10 4466     Our ancient word of courage, fair Saint George,
10 4467     Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons!
10 4468     Upon them! Victory sits on our helms.                 Exeunt

10 4476 
10 4477 Alarum; excursions. Enter NORFOLK and forces; to him CATESBY
10 4478 
10 4479   CATESBY. Rescue, my Lord of Norfolk, rescue, rescue!
10 4480     The King enacts more wonders than a man,
10 4481     Daring an opposite to every danger.
10 4482     His horse is slain, and all on foot he fights,
10 4483     Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death.
10 4484     Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost.
10 4485 
10 4486                      Alarums. Enter KING RICHARD
10 4487 
10 4488   KING RICHARD. A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!
10 4489   CATESBY. Withdraw, my lord! I'll help you to a horse.
10 4490   KING RICHARD. Slave, I have set my life upon a cast
10 4491     And I Will stand the hazard of the die.
10 4492     I think there be six Richmonds in the field;
10 4493     Five have I slain to-day instead of him.
10 4494     A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!             Exeunt

10 4502 
10 4503 Alarum. Enter RICHARD and RICHMOND; they fight; RICHARD is slain.
10 4504 Retreat and flourish. Enter RICHMOND, DERBY bearing the crown,
10 4505 with other LORDS
10 4506 
10 4507   RICHMOND. God and your arms be prais'd, victorious friends;
10 4508     The day is ours, the bloody dog is dead.
10 4509   DERBY. Courageous Richmond, well hast thou acquit thee!
10 4510     Lo, here, this long-usurped royalty
10 4511     From the dead temples of this bloody wretch
10 4512     Have I pluck'd off, to grace thy brows withal.
10 4513     Wear it, enjoy it, and make much of it.
10 4514   RICHMOND. Great God of heaven, say Amen to all!
10 4515     But, teLL me is young George Stanley living.
10 4516   DERBY. He is, my lord, and safe in Leicester town,
10 4517     Whither, if it please you, we may now withdraw us.
10 4518   RICHMOND. What men of name are slain on either side?
10 4519   DERBY. John Duke of Norfolk, Walter Lord Ferrers,
10 4520     Sir Robert Brakenbury, and Sir William Brandon.
10 4521   RICHMOND. Inter their bodies as becomes their births.
10 4522     Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled
10 4523     That in submission will return to us.
10 4524     And then, as we have ta'en the sacrament,
10 4525     We will unite the white rose and the red.
10 4526     Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction,
10 4527     That long have frown'd upon their emnity!
10 4528     What traitor hears me, and says not Amen?
10 4529     England hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself;
10 4530     The brother blindly shed the brother's blood,
10 4531     The father rashly slaughter'd his own son,
10 4532     The son, compell'd, been butcher to the sire;
10 4533     All this divided York and Lancaster,
10 4534     Divided in their dire division,
10 4535     O, now let Richmond and Elizabeth,
10 4536     The true succeeders of each royal house,
10 4537     By God's fair ordinance conjoin together!
10 4538     And let their heirs, God, if thy will be so,
10 4539     Enrich the time to come with smooth-fac'd peace,
10 4540     With smiling plenty, and fair prosperous days!
10 4541     Abate the edge of traitors, gracious Lord,
10 4542     That would reduce these bloody days again
10 4543     And make poor England weep in streams of blood!
10 4544     Let them not live to taste this land's increase
10 4545     That would with treason wound this fair land's peace!
10 4546     Now civil wounds are stopp'd, peace lives again-
10 4547     That she may long live here, God say Amen!            Exeunt

10 4583 
10 4584 Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no

10 4587 permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
10 4588 set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
10 4589 copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
10 4590 protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
10 4591 Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
10 4592 charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
10 4593 do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
10 4594 rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose

10 4605 THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
10 4606 PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK
10 4607 
10 4608 To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
10 4609 distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
10 4610 (or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
10 4611 Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
10 4612 Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
10 4613 http://gutenberg.org/license).

10 4615 
10 4616 Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
10 4617 electronic works
10 4618 
10 4619 1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
10 4620 electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
10 4621 and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
10 4622 (trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
10 4623 the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
10 4624 all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
10 4625 If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
10 4626 Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
10 4627 terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
10 4628 entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
10 4629 
10 4630 1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
10 4631 used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
10 4632 agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
10 4633 things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
10 4634 even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
10 4635 paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
10 4636 Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
10 4637 and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
10 4638 works.  See paragraph 1.E below.
10 4639 
10 4640 1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
10 4641 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
10 4642 Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
10 4643 collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
10 4644 individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
10 4645 located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
10 4646 copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
10 4647 works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
10 4648 are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
10 4649 Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
10 4650 freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
10 4651 this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
10 4652 the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
10 4653 keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
10 4654 Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.
10 4655 
10 4656 1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
10 4657 what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
10 4658 a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
10 4659 the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
10 4660 before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
10 4661 creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
10 4662 Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
10 4663 the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
10 4664 States.
10 4665 
10 4666 1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
10 4667 
10 4668 1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
10 4669 access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
10 4670 whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
10 4671 phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
10 4672 Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
10 4673 copied or distributed:
10 4674 
10 4675 This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
10 4676 almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
10 4677 re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
10 4678 with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license
10 4679 
10 4680 1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
10 4681 from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
10 4682 posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
10 4683 and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
10 4684 or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
10 4685 with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
10 4686 work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
10 4687 through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
10 4688 Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
10 4689 1.E.9.
10 4690 
10 4691 1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
10 4692 with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
10 4693 must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
10 4694 terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
10 4695 to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
10 4696 permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.
10 4697 
10 4698 1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
10 4699 License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
10 4700 work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.
10 4701 
10 4702 1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
10 4703 electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

10 4705 active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
10 4706 Gutenberg-tm License.

10 4708 1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
10 4709 compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
10 4710 word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
10 4711 distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
10 4712 "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
10 4713 posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
10 4714 you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
10 4715 copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
10 4716 request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
10 4717 form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
10 4718 License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
10 4719 
10 4720 1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
10 4721 performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
10 4722 unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
10 4723 
10 4724 1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
10 4725 access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
10 4726 that
10 4727 
10 4728 - You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
10 4729      the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
10 4730      you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
10 4731      owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
10 4732      has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
10 4733      Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
10 4734      must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
10 4735      prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
10 4736      returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
10 4737      sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
10 4738      address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
10 4739      the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."
10 4740 
10 4741 - You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
10 4742      you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
10 4743      does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
10 4744      License.  You must require such a user to return or
10 4745      destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
10 4746      and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
10 4747      Project Gutenberg-tm works.
10 4748 
10 4749 - You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

10 4751      electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
10 4752      of receipt of the work.
10 4753 
10 4754 - You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
10 4755      distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.
10 4756 
10 4757 1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
10 4758 electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
10 4759 forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
10 4760 both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
10 4761 Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

10 4763 
10 4764 1.F.
10 4765 
10 4766 1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
10 4767 effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
10 4768 public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
10 4769 collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
10 4770 works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
10 4771 "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
10 4772 corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
10 4773 property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
10 4774 computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
10 4775 your equipment.
10 4776 
10 4777 1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
10 4778 of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
10 4779 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

10 4781 Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
10 4782 liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
10 4783 fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
10 4784 LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
10 4785 PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
10 4786 TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
10 4787 LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
10 4788 INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
10 4789 DAMAGE.
10 4790 
10 4791 1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
10 4792 defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
10 4793 receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
10 4794 written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
10 4795 received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
10 4796 your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
10 4797 the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
10 4798 refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
10 4799 providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
10 4800 receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
10 4801 is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
10 4802 opportunities to fix the problem.
10 4803 
10 4804 1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
10 4805 in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
10 4806 WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
10 4807 WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
10 4808 
10 4809 1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
10 4810 warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
10 4811 If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
10 4812 law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
10 4813 interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
10 4814 the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
10 4815 provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.
10 4816 
10 4817 1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
10 4818 trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
10 4819 providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
10 4820 with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
10 4821 promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
10 4822 harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
10 4823 that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
10 4824 or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
10 4825 work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
10 4826 Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.

10 4828 
10 4829 Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
10 4830 
10 4831 Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
10 4832 electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
10 4833 including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
10 4834 because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
10 4835 people in all walks of life.
10 4836 
10 4837 Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
10 4838 assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
10 4839 goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
10 4840 remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
10 4841 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
10 4842 and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
10 4843 To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

10 4874 Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
10 4875 Literary Archive Foundation
10 4876 
10 4877 Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
10 4878 spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
10 4879 increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
10 4880 freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
10 4881 array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
10 4882 ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
10 4883 status with the IRS.
10 4884 
10 4885 The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
10 4886 charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
10 4887 States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
10 4888 considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
10 4889 with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
10 4890 where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
10 4891 SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
10 4892 particular state visit http://pglaf.org
10 4893 
10 4894 While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
10 4895 have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
10 4896 against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
10 4897 approach us with offers to donate.
10 4898 
10 4899 International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
10 4900 any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
10 4901 outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
10 4902 
10 4903 Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
10 4904 methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
10 4905 ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

10 4913 concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
10 4914 with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
10 4915 Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

10 4918 Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
10 4919 editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
10 4920 unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
10 4921 keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
